<h2>Christmas&nbsp;Pudding</h2>
<p>This amount makes one large pudding and two smaller ones,
(about 5 quarts) so scale down to your&nbsp;needs.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;   &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;
1 lb        Raisins
1 lb        Sultanas
1 lb        currants
1 lb        suet (if you can&#8217;t get suet, you could use 1/2 lb butter)
3/4 lb      mixed peel
1/2 tsp     powdered nutmeg
1/2 tsp     cinnamon
1/4 lb      ground almonds
1/2 lb      brown sugar
small glass brandy (whiskey would do)
pinch       salt
4 apples    minced
6 ozs       cherries (can be assorted colours)
11 or 12    eggs beaten
1 lb        bread&shy;crumbs
1/4 lb      plain flour
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&nbsp;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Mix all in&shy;gre&shy;di&shy;ents together and stir well. Grease bowls.
I put two layers of tinfoil on top and tie with string.
Cook for approx 9 hours (doesn&#8217;t have to be con&shy;sec&shy;u&shy;tive).
You can steam them but be careful not
to let the water boil away. What I do now is to put them
standing in a roasting tray in the oven in about two inches
of water and top up the water when necessary. Medium oven,
about 150C or&nbsp;300F.</p>
<p>Just heat on the&nbsp;day.</p>

<div class="section" id="christmas-cake">
<h2>Christmas&nbsp;Cake</h2>
<p>Makes 9&quot; round&nbsp;cake.</p>
<p>Line tin with buttered grease&shy;proof paper (two layers) on sides
and bottom.
Must be 3&quot; taller than tin.
Put brown paper around outside to prevent burning: prevents base being
burned.
Before putting into oven, make a 3&quot; wide scoop in centre of top;
glaze cake with some milk to prevent cracking.
Cake takes approx four hours to cook. If getting too brown, put
some paper on top for last half hour. Don&#8217;t open oven before that.
Cook on 2nd shelf from the bottom. My oven in Dublin I cook at
cook at 300F for 1 1/2 hours and reduce
to 250F for 2 1/2 hours.
While still warm, pierce top several times and pour in a little whiskey.
Leave in tin&nbsp;overnight.</p>

12 ozs      butter
12 ozs      brown sugar
12 ozs      plain flour
1 tsp       salt
12 ozs      Raisins*
12 ozs      sultanas
6 ozs       currants
6 ozs       candied peel
4 ozs       glace cherries
4 ozs       walnuts option
al?         (cut in half) [what is this?]
2 ozs       angelica, optional

Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.</div>
<p>take the stone and leave the flesh. I usually cut them in half as they are&nbsp;big.</p>
<p>Soak all fruit overnight in some whiskey (approx half cup) or brandy.
Stir and cover.
Cream butter and sugar very well: about 10 mins in a beater.
Whip eggs together and sieve flour.
Gradually add eggs slowly and alternate with some flour
(it might be better to do this by hand to prevent curdling).
Add rest of dry in&shy;gre&shy;di&shy;ents.
Lastly add soaked fruit. Stir and pour into lined tin.
Make hollow in centre of cake and brush with beaten egg
or some milk to give nice finish, and so it doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;crack.</p>

<p>In a large saucepan, bring apples, juice, and rind of lemon
and orange, and cider to the boil over moderate heat.
Reduce the heat to low and simmer the mixture, stirring
oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly for 10 minutes. Stir in sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg,
cloves, raisins, and currants. When sugar has dissolved,
simmer the mixture for a further fifteen minutes.
Remove pan from heat and stir in glace cherries.
Allow mixture to cool in the pan. Stir in Rum.
Spoon mixture into clean dry jars.
Cover the jars with jam covers or aluminum foil.
Tie and store in a cool dry place.
Keeps in&shy;def&shy;i&shy;nite&shy;ly.
(Wash and sterilise jars by heating in oven and while still warm,
fill with mixture.)
This makes about 8 one-pound&nbsp;jars.</p>
