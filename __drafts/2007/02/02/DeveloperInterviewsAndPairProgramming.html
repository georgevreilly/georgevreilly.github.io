<p>There&#8217;s a lot of buzz lately about developer interviews, sparked by some
posts about the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html">FizzBuzz</a> screening&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no fan of the brain teaser interviews that used to be so popular at
Microsoft. I find them profoundly worthless.
Nor do I think much of the write-a-complex-algorithm-on-the-whiteboard
questions that were so popular at Microsoft.
I think they have little predictive value in measuring the value
of a software&nbsp;engineer.</p>
<p>I want to talk about part of the interview process for developers at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.WorkForAtlas.com/">Atlas</a>.
After the initial phone screen, promising candidates are
invited in for several hours of interviews.
In addition to talking to the recruiter, the dev manager, and the
program manager, there are at least three interviews with the dev team:
modeling, coding, and team&nbsp;fit.</p>
<p>In the modeling interview, we ask you to model something on the whiteboard.
We&#8217;re looking to see how well you grasp object ori&shy;en&shy;ta&shy;tion, design,
behaviors, re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ties, and changing re&shy;quire&shy;ments.
No code is written during this interview.
It won&#8217;t hurt if you know a little <span class="caps">UML</span> and some design patterns,
but we value good com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion skills over <span class="caps">OO</span> purity.
Personally, when I was on the receiving end of this interview,
I found it to be one of the most useful and enjoyable interviews
that I had ever done.
Bouncing ideas off the in&shy;ter&shy;view&shy;er was a lot of&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>In the team fit interview, two or three members of the dev team
sit down with you and interact socially, often over lunch.
It&#8217;s important to us that you&#8217;re going to mesh well with the team.
It&#8217;s also an op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ty for us to sell you on working here.
Good people are hard to find and we don&#8217;t want to lose you
because we left you with a poor impression of&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked with two different teams and they take very different
approaches to the coding&nbsp;interview.</p>
<p>One team gives you a written&nbsp;test</p>
