Bob Howard is a computational demonologist who works for the occult British spy agency
informally known as the Laundry.
He's a computer hacker who's starting to get some field experience,
but nobody would confuse him with a suave ladykilling man of action.
A billionaire is intent upon raising an eldritch horror from the depths of the sea.
Only Bob, who has been “destiny entangled” with a sultry American operative, can stop him.
Bob is the last to realize that Ellis Billington has protected himself with a geas_,
casting himself as a Bond villain re-enacting `Thunderball`_,
and that Bob—and only Bob—has to step into the Bond role.

Stross has a lot of fun with the Bond tropes and he pulls it off.
Recommended.
