I was a 19-year-old Computer Science student at Trinity College Dublin
when I got my first ever programming job working for Lendac Data Systems,
a little Irish computer company who did the software for various TV shows on RTÃ‰,
Ireland's national broadcaster.
I had a part-time job for nearly five years writing the software for shows
including Murphy's Micro Quiz-m, Rapid Roulette, the Carrolls Irish Open,
Live Aid, and the Weather Report,
and sometimes I operated one of the computers behind the scenes.
I was there for a number of episodes of Micro Quiz-m.
This one was recorded about six months before I started.
