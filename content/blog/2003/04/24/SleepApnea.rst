I gave the following speech to Toastmasters on March 5th, 2003, as Speech
#3, "Organize Your Speech".

    SLEEP APNEA

    My wife is a cyborg.

    That's not to say that she's the Terminator. Nor even that she's the
    six-million dollar woman, although I do value her greatly. She calls
    herself a cyborg because she sleeps with a breathing machine. At night,
    she wears a mask over her nose to force air into her lungs.

    When I first met her, she complained of being tired all the time, of
    not getting a good night's sleep, of feeling stupid. When she drove for
    any length of time, she'd have to pull over for a short nap every hour.
    It was that or fall asleep at the wheel.

    Once we started spending the night together, I quickly learned that she
    snores. Loudly. But it was a different kind of snoring than I was used
    to. In my experience, most people snore steadily, in a seesaw pattern
    like this: <snore in> <whistle out> <pause> <snore in> <whistle out>

    Not so Emma. She would be very quiet for a minute or so, hardly
    breathing at all. Then she'd breathe in very loudly, almost gasping for
    air: <SNNNNORKKK!!> She'd go quiet for a minute or so, then snore
    loudly again. And so the cycle would repeat. All night long.

    Naturally, I didn't enjoy this much. Sometimes, it would keep me awake
    for hours, and I'd have to move to the spare room just to get some
    sleep.

    After one such episode, when I snarled "I can't take this anymore!" at
    her, she decided to see her doctor about it.

    Emma's doctor thought that her symptoms sounded like sleep apnea, even
    though she didn't fit the stereotype of being an overweight,
    middle-aged man.

    Apnea is Greek for "without breath". Sleep apnea is a breathing
    disorder, where the sufferer repeatedly stops breathing during sleep.
    After a minute or two without breathing, which leads to a reduction in
    blood-oxygen saturation, the brain forces the upper airway muscles to
    open the airway. Breathing resumes, usually with a loud snoring sound
    or gasp. These frequent arousals means that the sufferer doesn't get
    much deep, restorative sleep: the REM sleep that you need to be
    well-rested.

    The effects of this lack of deep sleep build up over time. The
    sufferers often feel very sleepy during the day. Their concentration
    suffers. They lack energy. They become irritable and they have
    difficulty learning things. They may fall asleep while driving and they
    are significantly more likely to have accidents. Occasionally, they may
    even die in their sleep.

    Sleep apnea occurs in all age groups and both sexes. It's estimated
    that four percent of middle-aged men have sleep apnea, and two percent
    of middle-aged women, with perhaps twelve to eighteen million Americans
    suffering from it. Most cases go undiagnosed.

    The primary kind of sleep apnea is due to an obstruction in breathing.
    This can be due to a physical abnormality in the nose, throat, or upper
    airway. Many, but not all, sufferers are overweight and have an excess
    of soft flesh in the airway. When they sleep, the muscles in the soft
    palate, at the back of the roof of the mouth, relax, closing the
    airway. This can make breathing difficult, or it can stop it
    altogether.

    One analogy is that it's like putting your hand over the nozzle of a
    vacuum cleaner. Your hand blocks all air getting in, like the upper
    airway collapses, even though the vacuum cleaner is still applying
    suction, just as the body continues to try to breathe. The vacuum
    cleaner is straining and so is the human body.

    Under managed care, Emma's doctor couldn't send her for a sleep study
    directly. Instead, she was referred to an ear-, nose-, and
    throat-specialist. He also joked that she didn't fit the stereotype of
    being fat, fifty, and male. He looked at her small mouth and nose and
    her undershot jaw, and he agreed that it probably was sleep apnea. He
    referred her to a sleep specialist. The sleep specialist also trotted
    out the line about her not fitting the stereotype, but he did schedule
    her for a sleep study.

    She spent a night at the sleep clinic in Swedish Hospital in Ballard.
    They attached electrodes all over her head and torso, as well as other
    instruments that made her look like the Bride of Frankenstein. The
    instruments were hooked up to a plotter that graphed all kinds of body
    functions continuously. When I came back in the morning to collect her,
    the plotter had produced a pile of fanfold paper that was a foot thick.

    When Emma went back to the sleep specialist for her follow appointment,
    he told her that she had stopped breathing about twenty-six times an
    hour. It was no wonder that she had such difficulty in getting a good
    night's rest.

    He told her that she could either have surgery or learn to sleep with
    the help of a breathing machine. The surgery would have involved
    removing excess tissue at the back of the throat and moving her jaw
    further forward. Emma was not keen on that, especially as the success
    rate of surgery is only about fifty to sixty percent.

    She opted for a CPAP sleep machine instead. She straps a nose-mask
    around her head. This nose-mask is connected by a hose to a continuous
    positive air-pressure machine. This forces air through her nose and
    into her lungs.

    She had to have a second sleep study to calibrate her CPAP machine for
    her breathing. It starts out at a low pressure and ramps up to the
    right pressure over a twenty-minute interval.

    It took her a few weeks to get accustomed to the CPAP machine. It's not
    a very natural feeling to have air forced into your nose continuously.
    She now sleeps far better with it than she did before. Sometimes, she
    doesn't bother to put on her mask before taking a nap, and she usually
    regrets it, because she wakes up feeling less rested.

    It took me a while to get used to the CPAP machine too, because it
    makes white noise all night long, as it's huffing away. It's a little
    like sleeping beside Darth Vader, and it's not very romantic, but it
    certainly beats her snoring.

    When we travel, we bring the CPAP machine in an overnight case, along
    with an extension cord and a selection of adapters for foreign
    electrical outlets. The CPAP machine means that we can't go camping for
    more than a night or so, or Emma doesn't get enough rest.

    In retrospect, Emma probably had sleep apnea for many years before it
    was diagnosed.

    Now, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea. Only if they also have
    difficulty in breathing and chronically can't get a good night's rest,
    are they likely to have sleep apnea. Most undiagnosed sleep apnea
    sufferers are unaware that they repeatedly stop breathing because they
    don't wake up far enough to realize it.

    If you know someone who may have the symptoms of sleep apnea, please,
    urge them to see their doctor. You could save their life.
