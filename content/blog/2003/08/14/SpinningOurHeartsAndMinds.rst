Good article on how the Bush administration is
`using language to influence public opinion
<http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/133628_tito10.html>`_.

Some examples:

*Civil service reform* means "flexibility" to replace civil service
protection with cronyism and patronage.

*Privatization* justifies the notion that corporations are more likely to
serve the public interest than publicly owned utilities, schools and
prisons.

*Support the troops*, a brilliant concept, suggests that if you question
foreign policy or war policy, you have the deaths of our finest young men
and women in uniform on your hands. Objective: to stifle public dissent.
