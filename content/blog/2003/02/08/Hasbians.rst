Amy Sohn writes about `Hasbians
<http://www.newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/nightlife/sex/columns/nakedcity/n_8301/>`_:
Women who came out of the closet only to end up in heterosexual
relationships.

I `came out as bi in 1991
<http://groups.google.com/groups?safe=images&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_umsgid=68830@brunix.UUCP&lr=&hl=en>`_.
I was very careful never to call myself "gay" because that label never fit
me. Even so, that must have been what many people heard, because only that
can explain their surprise when I told them a few years later that I had
fallen in love with Emma and was going to marry her.

Now many people believe I'm heterosexual, unless I take the trouble to
educate them. Bisexual Invisibility. <sigh>
