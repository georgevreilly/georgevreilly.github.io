The Independent `profiles Congresswoman Barbara Lee
<http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article117938.ece>`_, the sole
Representative to vote against President Bush's resolution of September 15,
2001 asking Congress for the authority to make war on any person, nation,
or organisation deemed responsible for the attacks.

Lee's argument for voting against the resolution: "Pared down to its
essentials, it ran like this: Congress represented the rational. It was a
body that had to remain above the fray. What decisions it made had to
consider the lasting good and not respond to the emotion of the moment. By
pushing for a vote so quickly, Lee believed, the Bush resolution was taking
power out of the hands of legislators and giving it to the executive
branch."

"It was something said at the memorial service that finally decided her. A
clergyman implored the assembled Congressmen and Senators: 'Let us not
become the evil we deplore.'"

Would that more members of Congress had had the fortitude to take such an
unpopular stand. We might not have had the `USA PATRIOT Act

a month later.
