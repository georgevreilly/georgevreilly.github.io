Tomorrow [Wed Feb 5th, 2003], Colin Powell goes to the UN to make his case
against Iraq. Reportedly, he has "no smoking gun".

To my mind, the Bush Administration has not yet made a compelling case for
going to war.

Yes, Saddam Hussein is a murderous tyrant. Yes, he has not come clean with
the UN and appears to be in "material breach" of Resolution 1441. Yes, he
almost certainly has chemical and biological weapons, though probably not
nuclear weapons.

But, to my mind, this is not a case for war. Containment has worked for the
last twelve years. Why should it not continue to work? It worked against
the Soviet Union for forty years of Cold War. And Saddam must surely know
that if he tries anything, he will be bombed back into the Stone Age.

Many suggestions are mooted for the Administration's yearning for war. Oil
is the most prominent one. Unproven links to Al Qaida. Finishing what was
started in Gulf War I. Strategic control of the Middle East. "Weapons of
mass distraction" to divert the US public's attention from the failing
economy and the Administration's war on the poor and the economy.

Or some combination of all of these. I don't know. If there is a good
reason, now is the time to tell us. Excuses about needing to protect
intelligence sources don't cut it. Hard evidence is required.
