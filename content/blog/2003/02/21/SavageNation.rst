Michael Savage is a radical right-wing talk-radio host and author, far more
obnxoxious than Rush Limbaugh. MSNBC has just `signed him to a weekly TV
show <http://msnbc.com/news/871672.asp>`_.
FAIR has issued an `action alert <http://www.fair.org/activism/msnbc-savage.html>`_
about this. Read `Ben Fritz
<http://www.salon.com/books/review/2003/02/19/savage/index.html>`_ in Salon,
or `michaelsavagesucks.com <http://www.michaelsavagesucks.com/>`_.

Here's the letter that I just sent to MSNBC:

    | From:       George V. Reilly
    | To:         feedback@msnbc.com ; Erik.Sorenson@msnbc.com
    | Cc:         fair@fair.org
    | Sent:       Friday, February 21, 2003 12:07 AM
    | Subject:    I object to Michael Savage's proposed TV show

    Michael Savage is an extremist thug, far beyond the pale of civilized
    discourse. He has made his name by spewing homophobic, racist,
    misogynistic venom. Even by the low standards of talk radio, he's a
    national disgrace.

    And now MSNBC proposes to give him a weekly show. If you give him a
    pulpit, you implicitly endorse his hatefulness. No doubt, you'll boost
    your ratings in the short run, but in the long run he'll drag you into
    the mire. In a race to the bottom with Rupert Murdoch, we will all
    lose.

    I believe in free speech. I believe that Savage has a right to say what
    he does, no matter how objectionable I may find it. But I don't believe
    that he needs the endorsement of a national TV show.

    There's no shortage of conservative voices in the media. And there's no
    need to give Savage his own show.

`StopDrLaura.com <http://www.stopdrlaura.com/>`_ got Dr. Laura's show pulled.
I wouldn't be surprised to see a similar boycott of The Savage Nation.
