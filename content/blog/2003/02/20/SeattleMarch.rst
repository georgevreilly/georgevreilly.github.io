Along with perhaps
`30 million others <http://www.guardian.co.uk/antiwar/story/0,12809,897098,00.html>`_,
Emma and I took part in a peace
rally on Saturday. We were delayed finishing up our signs, so we failed to
meet up with our friends before the `Seattle rally <http://www.feb15.org/>`_,
although we did run into
another friend as the march set off.

There were an estimated `20,000 people
<http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/aplocal_story.asp?category=6420&slug=WA%20Anti%20War%20Protests%20Wash>`_
at the Seattle rally, according to
the Seattle P-I. I would have thought more. It took eighty minutes from the
first marchers setting out to the last of the marchers getting a few blocks
away from the Seattle Center.

The night before the rally, I found a number of slogans on a mailing list,
and I turned 16 of them into signs (see the second of my `photos
<http://www.george-reilly.com/sea-peace-feb15/index.html>`_). We gave
most of them out to strangers before the rally. I marched with "Don’t Waive
Your Rights while Waving Your Flag"; Emma had "Preemptive Impeachment".

  1. Contain Saddam -- and Bush
  2. War begins with 'Dubya'
  3. Who Would Jesus Bomb?
  4. How did our oil get under their sand?
  5. Sacrifice Our SUVs, not our Children
  6. Preemptive Impeachment
  7. Our Grief over 9/11 is not a Cry for War
  8. You don’t have to like Bush to love America
  9. America, get out of the Bushes!
  10. Pro-Lifers: Wake from Bush’s spell! War kills Innocent Children
  11. Preemptive Peace
  12. We Can’t Afford to Rule the World
  13. Don’t Waive Your Rights while Waving Your Flag
  14. Drop Bush, not Bombs!
  15. Bush is to Christianity as Osama is to Islam
  16. War is not a Family Value

I'm glad we went. It was good to feel some solidarity. It was especially
good to learn that so many others turned out at other rallies around the
world. We showed the world that not everyone in America is in lockstep
behind Bush.

Bush, however, remains unimpressed, at least in public. We can only hope
that it makes him pause even a little in private, but I doubt it.

My youngest brother, `Mark <http://www.alienresident.net/>`_,
took part in the New York rally. He said that
the NYPD made it `impossible to get to the center of the rally
<http://www.warblogging.com/archives/000501.php>`_. My other
brother, David, and my sister, Michelle, took part in the rally in Dublin.
