Earlier today, I posted `some reactions to Powell's visit to the UN
</blog/2003/02/10/CasusBelliII.html>`_, including my own. Since then,
I've come across some interesting links.

`Powell's Evidence Looking Shaky
<http://www.slacktivist.blogspot.com/2003_02_02_slacktivist_archive.html#90292593>`_
describes several serious shortcomings: the aluminum tubes, "the fine paper
that the United Kingdom distributed" (plagiarized), and a supposed al-Qaida
camp in Northern Iraq.

The LA Times has `Iraq Opens Suspicious Sites to Eyes of Media
<http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-sites8feb08,1,4010659.story?coll=la%2Dhome%2Dheadlines>`_.

In a lighter note, Neal Pollack makes fun of
`live coverage of the Powell address
<http://www.nealpollack.com/cgi-bin/blog/do.cgi/200302050920/permalink>`_.

I fear that Bush has painted himself into a corner. He can't afford to back
down now without losing face. That means we'll go to war, unless Saddam
steps down, which is almost as unlikely as Bush backing down. Feh!
