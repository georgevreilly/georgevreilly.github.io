I saw `The Closer You Get <http://us.imdb.com/Title?0218112>`_
yesterday. It's a comedy about desperate bachelors
in an Irish fishing village, who place an ad in the Miami Herald for
American women to come to Donegal. It's an inoffensive, lightweight piece
of `paddywhackery <http://www.spiked-online.com/articles/00000002D476.htm>`_
in the spirit of `Waking Ned Devine <http://us.imdb.com/Title?0166396>`_.

These "Irish Personals" arrived in my inbox this morning. Very apropos.

    Grossly overweight Louth turfcutter, 42 years old and 23 stone, Gemini,
    seeks nimble sexpot, preferably South American, for tango sessions,
    candlelit dinners and humid nights of screaming passion. Must have own
    car and be willing to travel.

    Following a sad recent loss, teetotal Tipperary man, 53, seeks
    replacement mammy. Must like biscuits and answer to the name Minnie.
    Thurles area.

    Galway man, 50, in desperate need of a ride. Anything considered.

    Heavy drinker, 35, Cork area, seeks gorgeous sex addict interested in
    pints, fags, Munster RFC, and starting scraps on Patrick Street at
    three in the morning.

    Bitter, disillusioned Kerryman lately rejected by longtime fiancee
    seeks decent, honest, reliable woman, if such a thing still exists in
    this cruel world of hatchet-faced bitches.

    Ginger-haired Galwegian trouble-maker, gets slit-eyed and shirty after
    a few scoops, seeks attractive, wealthy lady for bail purposes, maybe
    more.

    Artistic Clare woman, 53, petite, loves rainy walks on the beach,
    writing poetry, unusual sea-shells and interesting brown rice dishes,
    seeks mystic dreamer for companionship, back rubs and more as we bounce
    along like little tumbling clouds on life's beautiful crazy journey.
    Strong stomach essential.

    Chartered accountant, 42, seeks female for marriage. Duties will
    include cooking, light cleaning and accompanying me to office social
    functions. References required. No timewasters.

    Bad-tempered, foul-mouthed old bastard living in a damp cottage in the
    arse end of Roscommon seeks attractive 21-year-old blonde lady with big
    chest.

    Devil-worshiper, Offaly area, seeks like minded lady for wining and
    dining, good conversation, dancing, romantic walks and slaughtering
    cats in cemeteries at midnight under the flinty light of a pale moon.

    Attractive brunette, Macroom area, winner of Miss Wrangler competition
    at Jolene's Nightclub, Macroom, in September 1978, seeks nostalgic man
    who's not afraid to cry for long nights spent comfort drinking and
    listening to old Abba records. Please, Please!

    Limerick man, 27, medium build, brown hair, blue eyes, seeks alibi for
    the night of February 27 between 8pm and 11:30pm.

    Optimistic Mayo man (Glen Corcoran), seeks blonde 20-year-old
    double-jointed supermodel who owns her own brewery and has an
    open-minded twin sister.
