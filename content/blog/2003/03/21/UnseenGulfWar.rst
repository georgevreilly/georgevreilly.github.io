Peter Turnley is a photojournalist who covered the first Gulf War.
`The Unseen Gulf War
<http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0212/pt_intro.html>`_
is his collection of previously unpublished photos from
that war. The photos present no political viewpoint, but what they do
"represent is a part of a more accurate picture of what really does happen
in war". Warning: there are a number of graphic images of corpses.
