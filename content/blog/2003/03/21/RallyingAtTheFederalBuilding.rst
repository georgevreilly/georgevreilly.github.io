    To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that
    we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only
    unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.

We're at war. The anti-war protests have ratcheted up, with hundreds of
thousands protesting all over the country.

Emma joined the protest outside the Federal Building in Seattle early this
evening. She went back to her office after an hour because her bad feet
were killing her. Not long after, I arrived in downtown and followed the
protesters as they marched up to Westlake, then back down to the Federal
Building, where Emma joined me again.

I have no hope that this will make any difference to Bush. But it's
important to be counted.

Senator Robert Byrd gave a fine speech yesterday, on the
`arrogance of power <http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0319-04.htm>`_.
Michael Kinsley wrote 
`Unauthorized entry - The Bush Doctrine: War without anyone's permission
<http://slate.msn.com/default.aspx?id=2080455>`_,
in today's Slate. Mike Duncan dissects the
speech that Bush gave on Monday night, giving Saddam 48 more hours in
`Lies, Damned Lies, and Ultimatums <http://www.weeklylowdown.com/031703spec.shtml>`_.
