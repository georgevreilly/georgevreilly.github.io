A `friend of Emma's <http://chadlupkes.blogspot.com>`_
sent her a link to an `article
<http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0316-08.htm>`_
by Thom Hartmann at `Commondreams.org <http://www.commondreams.org/>`_.

    The 70th anniversary wasn't noticed in the United States, and was
    barely reported in the corporate media. But the Germans remembered well
    that fateful day seventy years ago - February 27, 1933. They
    commemorated the anniversary by joining in demonstrations for peace
    that mobilized citizens all across the world.

    It started when the government, in the midst of a worldwide economic
    crisis, received reports of an imminent terrorist attack. A foreign
    ideologue had launched feeble attacks on a few famous buildings, but
    the media largely ignored his relatively small efforts. The
    intelligence services knew, however, that the odds were he would
    eventually succeed. (Historians are still arguing whether or not rogue
    elements in the intelligence service helped the terrorist; the most
    recent research implies they did not.)

    ...

I'm not quite paranoid enough (yet) to buy the analogy, but the numerous
parallels are eerie and discomforting.
