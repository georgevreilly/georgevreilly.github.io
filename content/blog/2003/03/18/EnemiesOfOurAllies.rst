Almost, but not quite, at war with Iraq. Saddam has forty-eight hours to
quit Iraq and avert war, but no-one expects him to do that. Feh.

I would feel slightly better about the new war if Bush had managed to forge
a broad-based coalition. Instead, in their heavyhanded way, Bush, Rumsfeld,
Cheney, and Perle have managed to piss off most of the world.

Paul Glastris has a
`good article in Slate <http://slate.msn.com/default.aspx?id=2080262>`_
about how Bush repeatedly botched
the opportunities to get the UN and NATO on board, in contrast with Clinton
in Kosovo and his own father for the first Gulf War.
