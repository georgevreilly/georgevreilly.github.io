`MoveOn.org <http://www.moveon.org/>`_
organized a rolling wave of `candlelight vigils
<http://www.globalvigil.org/>`_ across the world
today, held at 7pm local time on Sunday, March 16th. Emma and I joined
three of our friends at the vigil at the Seattle Central Community College,
at Broadway and Pike. I estimate that there were 300-400 people there, and
probably thousands more at the other vigils in the Seattle area.

It looks certain that Bush will declare war on Iraq in the next day or two.
I'm still against the war. I would very much like to see Saddam gone (the
poor bloody Iraqis never deserved thirty-plus years of that thug's
misrule), but I don't trust Bush to do it right. Look at how badly they've
followed through in Afghanistan: the country has reverted to warlordism
outside of Kabul.

Nor has he made a `compelling case <http://www.msnbc.com/news/882083.asp>`_
for going to war. Instead, he and the
neocon hawks have managed to alienate the whole world. Eighteen months ago,
after 9/11, the world reacted with horror, and made sincere gestures of
friendship. Now, practically everyone loathes and fears Bush.

I want the inevitable war to end as quickly as possible, with as little
bloodshed as possible. But Mark LeVine at Alternet points out that
`'Bush Wins' could be a nightmare scenario for the Left
<http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=15379>`_.

`Sound Nonviolent Opponents of War <http://www.snowcoalition.org/>`_
are coordinating further peace rallies in
the Puget Sound area. (Tip for candlelight vigils: punch a hole through the
bottom of a Dixie (translucent wax-paper) cup and push the candle through
that; the cup will catch dripping wax and it will also protect the flame
from the wind.)
