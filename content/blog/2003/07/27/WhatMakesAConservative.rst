I found an interesting piece about `what makes a political conservative
<http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/22_politics.shtml>`_.

    Four researchers who culled through 50 years of research literature
    about the psychology of conservatism report that at the core of
    political conservatism is the resistance to change and a tolerance for
    inequality, and that some of the common psychological factors linked to
    political conservatism include:

        * Fear and aggression
        * Dogmatism and intolerance of ambiguity
        * Uncertainty avoidance
        * Need for cognitive closure
        * Terror management
