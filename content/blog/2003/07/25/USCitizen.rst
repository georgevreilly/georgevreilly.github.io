As I mentioned in `my Toastmasters' speech about naturalization
</blog/2003/05/16/Naturalization.html>`_, I decided
on September 11th, 2002 to become a U.S. citizen.

This morning, I had my interview with the Bureau of Citizenship and
Immigration Services (`BCIS <http://www.bcis.gov/>`_, formerly known as the INS).

This afternoon, I was sworn in as a U.S. citizen at the Seattle INS Office.
Eighty-three other new citizens were sworn in at the same time. Many were
Filipino, Vietnamese, Mexican, or Eastern European. Only three others, all
Brits, were from Western Europe. We were gathered into a stuffy room with
an overflow crowd of relatives and friends. It was not a deeply moving
ceremony, but it was clear that most of us were sincerely glad to become
Americans. If my interview had come a month sooner, I would have chosen to
participate in the massive July 4th ceremony at the Seattle Center.

Woohoo! Now I get a vote for the first time since 1986. As my youngest
brother Mark, who became a citizen last year, just told me, I now have an
opportunity to get the Bush kleptocracy out of office.
