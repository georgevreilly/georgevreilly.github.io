I gave the following speech to Toastmasters on October 1st, 2003, as Speech
#5, "Vocal Variety".

    SPOLIN GAMES

    Spolin Games. That sounds like it could be a new set of titles for the
    Xbox.

    Far from it.

    The Spolin Games are a set of improv theater games invented by Viola
    Spolin in the nineteen-thirties, and refined by her for the next six
    decades. These games are used in improvisational work, to help bring
    out creativity and spontaneity. Viola's son, Paul Sills, founded the
    Second City improv theater company in Chicago back in the
    nineteen-fifties.

    I was first introduced to the Spolin Games last year. Two friends of
    mine are actors. They had both become involved with a local improv
    troupe, the Spolin Players, who have occasional runs at the Northwest
    Actors Studio, at 11th and Pike, in Seattle.

    I got interested enough that I later took an improv class from the
    troupe's director, Gary Schwartz.

    I've been to several shows put on by the Spolin Players. Each one is
    quite different. During a show, they'll play a dozen or so games, from
    their repertoire. Usually, there are six-to-eight actors from the
    troupe.

    The show often opens with a game called Emotional Symphony. Each player
    is assigned an emotion by the audience, such as fear (oh no! I'm
    terrified! I just want to hide!); lust (ooh, baby! You're hot!); anger
    (I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!); or confusion
    (but, but, but, I don't understand). The director acts like a
    conductor, pushing the players through an overture, bringing them in
    louder and softer, growing in a crescendo to a climax!

    This energizes the players and wakes up the audience.

    The Gibberish Relay is another game that's usually played early on.
    Three players sit on chairs at the front of the stage. The one on the
    left speaks one dialect of gibberish, the one on the right speaks a
    different variety, the one in the middle interprets.

    Left (tapping wrist): Herk, koffa picku? Akno bigu karpak! Interpreter:
    Say, what's the time? My watch has stopped! Right (rubbing tummy): Maru
    plenio seletto bulioni. Molto chiani. Interpreter: It must be
    lunchtime. I'm hungry. Left: Plokka kaloka, ragutz ni globbak.
    Interpreter: In my country, we never eat lunch. And so on.

    After a minute, one of the players leaves, the other two shift over,
    and a new player joins them, until the entire cast has cycled through
    each role.

    One crucial element was missing from the demonstration that I just gave
    you. Spontaneity! In a real game of Gibberish Relay, none of the three
    players know what's going to happen next. They're feeding off each
    other, creating a scene out of whole cloth. They're off-balance and
    they're fully engaged. It's like going to a sports game. You don't know
    what's going to happen next or who's going to win. The not-knowing
    keeps you interested and in the moment. There's give-and-take at play.
    Each player is following the other's lead. Surprise is the gift that
    playing produces.

    Magic Music is another game that's often played. One of the players is
    sent offstage, out of earshot. The audience decides a complex task that
    the player must accomplish on a prop-laden stage, such as climbing onto
    a chair, turning counterclockwise, and putting a flowerpot on their
    head. When the player returns, the audience are singing a simple song,
    such as "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star." The audience sings louder as
    the player grows "warm" and softer as the player gets "cold", until the
    player figures out what to do. Often, the game is repeated with a
    volunteer from the audience.

    The game of Camera involves focus. The audience decides upon a scene
    for two of the players, such as a teacher and a parent, or two people
    in line for a concert, or a mugger and a vigilante. As the two players
    work through the scene, the director calls out "Camera!", alternating
    between the two players, "Both camera!", and "No camera!". For "George
    Camera!", I would look intently at the other player, as if I were a TV
    camera, tracking her every move. For "Mary Camera!", Mary would look
    intently at me, while I would play the scene naturally as if there were
    no camera at all. The act of focussing heightens the scene.

    Now, let's demonstrate one game, Last-Letter Expert, with the help of
    Phil here.

    In Last-Letter Expert, I am a genius who can expound on any topic of
    your choosing. The only catch is that my brain is so overpowered that
    it seizes up occasionally in mid-sentence. My assistant Phil will
    interject a word to help me out. I have to use the LAST letter of his
    word as the FIRST letter of my next word. So if I were to say, "There
    are many varieties of ice cream that ..." and Phil says "suddenly",
    then I have to pick a word that starts with the letter "Y" and continue
    from there, like "Yelp loudly" or "Yet delightfully".

    Please, give me a topic, such as volcanoes, shoelaces, ice cream,
    walking on your hands, daffodil farming, the color yellow, ...

    [Reconstructed from a recording. Phil hadn't quite got the idea of
    Last-Letter Expert. The interjected word should make some kind of sense
    in the context of the preceding sentences. "Tempest" was the Word of
    the Day.]

    Audience: Chairs!

    George: Chairs. Fellow members of the audience, chairs have been used
    since time immemorial. They are extremely...

    Phil: Repairman

    George: Nowadays, we. Repairman? Nowadays, we sit on them. In times
    past, chairs were used to elevate people above the common level of ...

    Phil: Soda machines

    George: so that you could do something extremely silly like this. And...

    Phil: Tempest

    George: To begin again, without such useful help, I would like to say
    that chairs are...

    Phil: Flat

    George: Therefore, they are very easy to sit upon.

    But enough of that. We're running out of time.

    Viola Spolin's work is used by many actors and directors to help
    increase their creativity. There are many other games, but I don't have
    time to describe them here. Go to `spolin.com

    learning more. S-P-O-L-I-N. Spolin.

I was also the Table Topics Master for that meeting. We played Last-Letter
Expert. It took a while for people to get the hang of the game, but it was
a big hit.
