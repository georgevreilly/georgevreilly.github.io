I sign a lot of petitions. Here's one that I wrote a custom letter for.

First, the background.

    From: "John - THE LIST" <john@gayadvocacy.com>

    Subject: THE LIST: Action Alert - Free Ruslan Sharipov
    **THE LIST - Special Alert for Gay Torture Victim**

    Washington, DC
    December 1, 2003

    Ruslan Sharipov, a journalist in Uzbekistan, is being imprisoned and
    tortured because he's gay. His government captors have threatened to
    rape him with a bottle and inject him with AIDS. But there is talk that
    the government may soon amnesty a few political prisoners. Let's make
    sure he is one of them by emailing the 3 key US officials below,
    demanding they tell the Uzbek government to free Ruslan Sharipov.

    I've managed to get the direct email addresses for these rather
    high-ranking US officials. Let's take advantage of our luck. And if
    you're not American, no matter - it's still good for them to hear that
    people around the world are watching America's actions on this
    important case:

        * `grossmanM2@state.gov <mailto:grossmanM2@state.gov>`_: Marc Grossman, Undersecretary for Political Affairs, US Dept. of State
        * `AppletonDE@state.gov <mailto:AppletonDE@state.gov>`_: David Appleton, Deputy Chief of Mission, US Embassy, Uzbekistan
        * `cranerlx@state.gov <mailto:cranerlx@state.gov>`_: Lorne Craner, Asst. Secretary, Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, US Dept. of State

    You can read more about Ruslan's case at the
    `Human Rights Watch Web site <http://thelist.c.tep1.com/maabIIBaa2zf3b4Ee9Wb/>`_.
    **BACKGROUND**

    Earlier this year, openly-gay journalist Ruslan Sharipov was given a
    five-year prison term by the Uzbek government simply because he is an
    openly-gay advocate for human rights in his Stalinist homeland. In the
    six months he's already been in prison, the 25-year-old Ruslan has been
    physically and mentally tortured, and forced to write his own suicide
    note. **WHY YOUR EMAILS MATTER**

    This month, December 2003, the Uzbek government, under intense
    international pressure from groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty
    International, is reportedly considering freeing some of its 7,000 to
    10,000 political prisoners. We need to make sure that Ruslan is among
    those freed.

    I have it on good authority that senior US officials do not believe the
    American people care about Ruslan's imprisonment and torture. They
    think we don't care that the Bush Administration is giving Uzbekistan
    $500 million a year in aid, much of it going towards training the very
    state security apparatus that tortures gays and lesbians and other
    political prisoners. And they think we don't care that earlier this
    year two political prisoners were boiled alive, and that our tax money
    helps all of this happen. **IT'S TIME TO TELL THE US GOVERNMENT WE DO
    CARE.**

    President Bush tells us he's fighting for freedom and democracy in
    Iraq, then supports a brutal dictator next door. President Bush needs
    to start practicing what he preaches. He should tell the government of
    Uzbekistan to free gay journalist Ruslan Sharipov. Again, those email
    addresses are: - grossmanM2@state.gov - AppletonDE@state.gov -
    cranerlx@state.gov

        * grossmanM2@state.gov
        * AppletonDE@state.gov
        * cranerlx@state.gov

    Thanks so much, and please share this email alert with all of your
    friends and colleagues. I truly believe that if we all get involved
    now, this is one we can win in no time. (I'm doing this update as a
    text-only version so you can easily forward it by email to your friends
    and colleagues.)

Here's the letter that I sent.

    From: George V. Reilly
    To: grossmanM2@state.gov ; AppletonDE@state.gov ; cranerlx@state.gov
    Sent: Tuesday, December 02, 2003 12:03 AM
    Subject: Free Ruslan Sharipov

    The Bush Administration has taken to arguing that the US invaded Iraq
    to save the Iraqi people from the brutality and torture of Saddam
    Hussein's regime, and to bring democracy. It's unquestionably good that
    the torturers of Iraq are gone.

    But the Administration has also given $500 million to Uzbekistan, where
    political prisoners have been boiled alive. Have we learned nothing
    from the past? Saddam was once our puppet, as were many other dictators
    in Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere. The CIA helped overthrow
    Mossadegh's democratically elected government in Iran in 1953, to our
    lasting cost. Supporting brutal dictators may help our strategic
    position in the short term, but it makes us look like hypocrites. Can
    we not do better than this?

    I am particularly concerned about the plight of Ruslan Sharipov, the
    gay journalist and human rights advocate who has been imprisoned in
    Uzbekistan on trumped-up charges. I ask you to call upon the Uzbek
    government to free Sharipov and other political prisoners.

May it do some good.

**Update**: Ruslan was released and `granted asylum in the U.S.
