In most of the world, as I write this, it's already 2015.
We in Seattle will enter the New Year in 4Â½ hours.

For me personally, it was a reasonably good year.
My health remained good,
I had a new `job </blog/2013/12/17/JoiningCookbrite.html>`_,
we had a good summer vacation,
and generally enjoyed ourselves.
Emma's health was not so great,
but she's set up an `Etsy shop for her knitting <https://www.etsy.com/shop/emmasimonesworkshop>`_
and started modeling for artists.

I look forward to 2015.
