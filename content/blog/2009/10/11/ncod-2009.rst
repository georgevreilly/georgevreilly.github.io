Today is `National Coming Out Day`_,
a day to promote awareness of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.
For anyone who doesn't already know: I'm bisexual.

I'm married to Emma.
That leads people to tacitly assume that I'm straight.
Too often, I do little or nothing to challenge that assumption,
either from straight people or gay people.

`I came out`_ in grad school, a couple of years after leaving Ireland.
It was difficult at first, but ultimately rewarding.

I'm married to a woman, but I could have ended up with a male partner,
a partner whom I could not legally marry in Washington state.
Emma and I married because anything else is second class.
This is the root of my passionate involvement with the `Approve 71`_ campaign.
It's also why I've been a leader of `BiNet Seattle`_ for more than a decade.

The `National Equality March`_ takes place in Washington DC this weekend.
Forty years after the Stonewall riots, LGBT people are rallying
for equal protection in all matters.
This is also the `Seattle LGBT Equality Weekend`_.

There's a march this afternoon, starting from Volunteer Park at 2pm.
I'll be there. Will you?

PS Let me refer you to Tim Wilson's `Coming Out as Good Citizenship`_.
