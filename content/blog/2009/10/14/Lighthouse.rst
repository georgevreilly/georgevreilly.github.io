Nathan Oliver is a great writer, but a horrible man.
Adam Dalgleish of Scotland Yard is called in when Oliver is found murdered
on an island that is exclusively reserved for VIPs.
Only a handful of people could possibly be the killer.

P.D. James adds psychological insight to a tightly plotted classic mystery.
Dalgleish is both a poet and a detective.
Both aspects are required to get to the heart of what happened on Combe Island.
