I'm breaking radio silence to explain the uncharacteristic drought of blog posts.
In my `last post`_, I mentioned that I had created a `Twibbon overlay for Approve71.org`_,
allowing you to overlay `Approve71`_'s badge over your Twitter icon.

The next day I went over to Approve71's headquarters and introduced
myself to the tech team, Josh, Joe, and Adam.
One thing led to another, and I spent that weekend writing my first-ever PHP code,
which allowed you to upload a photo to Approve71's website,
stamp a banner on it, and then save it so that you could subsequently
upload it to Facebook for your profile picture.

It's been a big success, used a couple of thousand times.

Since then, I spent a lot of time working on a second version,
which lets you crop the photo (using `imgAreaSelect`_)
and choose from a set of overlay banners.
Some of the banners are for the `NO on 1`_ campaign in Maine,
where they're fighting an attempted repeal of their same-sex marriage law.
