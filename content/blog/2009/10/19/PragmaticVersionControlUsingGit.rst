As part of my `personal conversion to Git`_, I read Swicegood's Git book.
It's a decent introduction to Git and you learn how to
do all the basic tasks as well as some more advanced topics.
The examples are clear and well-paced.

I would have liked to see more about collaboration and workflow in a DVCS world,
perhaps a few case studies:
how is Git used in the Linux kernel development process;
how a small, distributed team uses Git and GitHub;
how a collocated team migrates from more traditional tools.

The book avoids discussing the lower levels of the Git object model,
which is a reasonable choice for a pragmatic guide.

Recommended.
