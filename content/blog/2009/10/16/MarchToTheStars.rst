Third in a series, but the first that I've read.

Prince Roger and his Marine bodyguard have been marooned
on an alien planet for six months.
With local allies, they fight their way halfway around the world to the spaceport.
And then the trouble really starts.

Well-done military SF:
plausible, hard-bitten characters;
good plotting; and exciting battle scenes.
