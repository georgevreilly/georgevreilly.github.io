Sonchai Jitpleecheep is a devout Buddhist, half Thai and half American,
and one of the few Bangkok cops who is not on the take.
An American marine is murdered grotesquely
in a manner that accidentally kills Sonchai's partner and soul brother.
Sonchai must help the FBI investigate and seek his own revenge.
The trail takes them through the foulest gutters and the palaces of the wealthy.
We encounter prostitutes, monks, shemales, jade collectors, and gangsters
in a tour of the Thailand that most Westerners barely glimpse.
