At the end of `The Thirteen-Gun Salute`_,
Aubrey, Maturin, and the crew of the *Diane*
were marooned on an East Indian island.
They are rescued eventually by a passing junk and taken to Batavia,
where the governor gives them a new ship, the *Nutmeg of Consolation*.
They resume their original mission and travel to the penal colony in New South Wales.
Sydney is a hellhole, ruled by capricious sadists.

This is another fine entry in the long-running Aubrey–Maturin saga.
Seafaring, a long chase, a couple of battles,
politics, and a great deal of naturalism
occupy the pages delightfully.

Highly recommended.
