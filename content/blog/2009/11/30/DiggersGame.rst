Digger Doherty is a smalltime Boston crook
who went to Vegas for a few days
and blew a lot of money that he didn't have.
Now he has to figure something out.

It seems like all of George V. Higgins' books—[`1`_], [`2`_]—\
involve lowlifes who like to talk. A lot.
He had a wonderful ear for dialogue.
Surprisingly, none of his books seem to have been adapted for the stage
and only `The Friends of Eddie Coyle`_ was filmed.
