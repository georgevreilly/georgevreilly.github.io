Kate Brannigan normally investigates white-collar crimes,
but reluctantly agrees to find popstar Jett's lost muse, Moira.
When Moira is murdered at Jett's mansion six weeks after Kate finds her,
Jett engages her again to discover which of his entourage did it.

Kate is engaging and cheeky and it's fun to ride along with her.
