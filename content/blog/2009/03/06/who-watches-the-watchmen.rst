`Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?`_ (Who Watches the Watchmen?) asked Juvenal.

Answer: we do.
The `Watchmen movie`_, that is.
Peter, Carol, Raven, Iain, Emma, and I are all going to see
the midnight initial showing at the `Pacific Science Center IMAX`_.

I'm not sure that I've ever been geeky enough to watch
the midnight opening of a movie before.
But it was Peter's idea.

Peter and I shared an apartment in 1990â€“92 when we were both grad students at Brown,
and it was his copy of *Watchmen* that I first read.

And so the loop closes.
