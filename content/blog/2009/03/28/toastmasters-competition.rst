I've been to a few Toastmasters competitions in the past.
Tonight was the first time that I helped out at one,
as one of the timers.
It was the combined Area 35 and 36 competition.

A typical Toastmasters competition has two parts,
a speech competition and an evaluation competition.
In the speech competition, the competitors give a prepared speech
on a topic of their own choosing.
Some speech competitions are humorous; tonight's wasn't.
In the evaluation competition,
the invited speaker gives a speech heard by all the competitors.
They are taken out of the room,
then one at a time, they come back in and evaluate that speech.

The speech competition is always fun.
You get to hear several good speeches.
I heard speeches tonight about a teenage boxing experience,
watching a mother's peaceful death in a hospice,
our collective obsession with "better",
and choosing a high school for a son.

In the evaluation competition,
it's interesting to hear different people's take
on the same speech.
