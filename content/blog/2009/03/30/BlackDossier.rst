England, 1958: an alternate universe where famous fictional characters really lived
and the regime of Big Brother has just come to an end.
Sixty years ago, the British Crown gathered together the Murray Group,
extraordinary adventurers charged with sensitive missions.
The remnants of the group fled England in World War II.
Now they've come back to steal their dossier from MI-5,
a dossier that could lead the Government back to them,
a dossier that details the exploits of earlier groups over the last 300 years.

LXG3 pulls in everything, from Gulliver's Travels to James Bond,
Orlando to Fanny Hill, Prospero to Toyland, Dan Dare to Billy Bunter,
and Bertie Wooster and Jeeves battling Cthulhu.
It's way over the top.
Mostly it's fun.
