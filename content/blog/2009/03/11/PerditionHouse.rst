Bay Tanner is a young widow and aspiring private investigator
from wealthy South Carolina stock.
When a hitherto unknown `shirt-tail`_ cousin (fifth half cousin, specifically)
bursts into Bay's life, she brings havoc in her train.

As one of the characters says,
the plot sounds like a made-for-TV movie.
Still, Bay is a feisty heroine and
the background is not one that has been mined deeply.
