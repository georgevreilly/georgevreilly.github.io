A few years ago, after watching one too many whodunnit TV mysterys, I coined my

    *Law of Economy of Characters*
        The killer is innocuously introduced in the first 20 minutes.

In real life, the killer may not be known until late in the investigation—if ever.

In a TV mystery, any non-recurring character who gets more than a few lines
has to be a potential suspect—to the audience.
The character is not there gratuitously.
Their salary is being paid for a reason.

It's not universally true, but it works more often than not.
It's less true in books, where throwaway characters are easy to introduce.

Googling around, I found the following, attributed to Roger Ebert:

    `Ebert's Law of Conservation of Characters`__:
        Any main character whose purpose is not readily apparent
        must be more important than he or she seems

    `Ebert's Law of Economy of Characters`__:
        Movie budgets make it impossible for any film to contain unnecessary characters.
        Therefore, all characters in a movie are necessary to the story—\
        even those who do not seem to be.
        Sophisticated viewers can use this Law to deduce the identity of a person
        being kept secret by the movie's plot:
        This "mystery" person is always the only character in the movie
        who seems otherwise extraneous.
        Cf. the friendly neighbor in Lady In White.

I'm in good company.
