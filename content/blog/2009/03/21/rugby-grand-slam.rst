I grew up hating rugby.
I spent `eleven years`_ at a `rugger-bugger school`_ in Dublin.
I couldn't stand the game.
I was a small, unathletic child with no interest in sports.
Rugby, even the modified rugby that they teach seven-year-olds,
was violent and unpleasant and involved running around cold, wet fields.
I had a big operation on my feet when I was 10
and I parlayed that into an excuse never to play rugby again.

I can't remember when I last watched a rugby match,
but it was surely back in the '80s,
as I doubt I've seen one over the 20 years that I've been in the States.

So imagine the improbability of my watching rugby today.
Truly a historic occasion.
But not just for me, but for Ireland too.
The Irish team won the `Grand Slam`_ for the first time in `61 years`_.

Some Irish friends invited us over for a big `Irish breakfast`_
and to watch the match.
To be honest, I was more tempted by the food than the match,
but I ended up enjoying the game.
It was a close game and a `nail-biting finish`_.
It was the first time that Emma had watched rugby
and she thought it was more interesting than the slow, staged plays
of American Football.

I was also reminded why I had never wanted to play rugby.
It is `often said`_ that rugby is a hooligan's game played by gentlemen,
while soccer is a gentlemen's game played by hooligans,
and the former was borne out today.
A dangerous, bloody game.
