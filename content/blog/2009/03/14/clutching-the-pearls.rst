Ow! Ow! Ow!
It's Friday the 13th and
I ransomed my car this evening from the shop for over two grandâ€”\
more than half of it labor.
I think I'm in the wrong line of business.
Maybe I should be a greasemonkey instead.

The clutch was worn out and the flywheel needed replacing,
which required taking out the transmission.

We've only had one other comparable bill with this car
and it has over 90,000 miles.
We're not doing too badly overall,
except that the other bill was late last year.

Feh.
