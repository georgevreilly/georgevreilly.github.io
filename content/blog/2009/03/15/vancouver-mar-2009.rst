We drove up to Vancouver today.
We'll be here until Tuesday.
It's my birthday tomorrow and
I have two days of vacation that I have to use by the end of March or lose them,
so why not.

I always like Vancouver.
It's unequivocally a major city.
Vancouver feels more urban than Seattle,
where people have only been moving into high-density
downtown condos and apartments for a few years.

We're staying at the `Sunset Inn and Suites`_ in the West End.
We stayed here before.
It's relatively cheap, clean, and centrally located.
No particular charm either.

Tomorrow, we see my great-uncle Dick and his wife Margaret.
They're both 92 and about to move into a retirement center.
We'll have a nice dinner in the evening for my birthday.
