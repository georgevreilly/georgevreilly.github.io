I am co-directing this year's reading of *Ulysses* with Helen.
We have decided to do the first half of the chapter with some light cuts.
The Circe character, Bella Cohen, will not be seen until next year,
as we'll be stopping shortly before she makes her entrance.

We had a readthrough-cum-planning meeting ten days ago at Helen's
and a rehearsal tonight at my house.
We'll need several more rehearsals, but it's starting to come together.

We'll be reading at the University Bookstore on Saturday, June 13th.
