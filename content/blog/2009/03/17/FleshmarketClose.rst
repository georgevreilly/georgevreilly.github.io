DI John Rebus investigates the murder of an illegal immigrant,
who had ties to asylum seekers in Edinburgh.
DS Siobhan Clarke looks into the disappearance of a teenaged girl;
soon, the rapist of the girl's sister is murdered.

Rebus and Siobhan struggle with the uglier side of life in Edinburgh,
notably, racism, latter-day slavery, and the increasing numbers of asylum seekers.
As usual, their personal lives are in a mess:
Rebus drinks too much;
Siobhan falls asleep with a tub of ice cream.

As in other `Rebus books`_, the two investigations end up
being linked somewhat too neatly for my liking.
