We discovered `Bistrot Bistro`_ in Kitsilano on a previous visit to Vancouver.
It's an agreeable little French restaurant just south of downtown.
Emma suggested that we eat there again for my birthday,
and it was a fine choice.

We ate from the *prix fixe* menu for $26 apiece.
She had the carrot soup, roast chicken, and raspberry sorbet;
I had the *pate de campagne*, a peppercorn steak, and a chocolate mousse.
The *prix fixe* included a sizeable quantity of *pommes frites*.
We added Brussel sprouts, a baguette with olive tapenade,
and a half-litre of Pinot Gris,
and walked away two hours later, pleasantly sated.

The last time we were there, it was full.
This time, there were plenty of seats.
I suspect a combination of Sunday night,
wet weather, and the economy.
The food was still good.
