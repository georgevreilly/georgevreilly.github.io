Leaving Sydney after the events of `The Nutmeg of Consolation`_,
Aubrey and Maturin sail for Moahu, a fictional British island near Hawaii.
Jack Aubrey is out of sorts for various reasons;
most notably a young female convict, Clarissa Harvill, has been smuggled
aboard by Midshipman Oakes.
Like many sailors, he is superstitious about women on board his ship.
Not without reason:
even after her shipboard marriage to Oakes,
men vie for her attention and factions form aboard the ship.

Few battles in this one.
Most of the conflict arises from individuals.

Highly recommended.
