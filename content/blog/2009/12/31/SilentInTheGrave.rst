A year after Sir Edward Grey's sudden collapse and death,
his widow Lady Julia realizes the truth in what
Nicholas Brisbane, the private inquiry agent, had told her:
Sir Edward had received threatening letters.
She engages Brisbane to investigate the possible murder
and starts asking questions herself.

The most respectable member of her large, eccentric family,
Julia starts to shed her Victorian conventionality
as she is drawn to the enigmatic Brisbane.
