Honey West is a “private eyeful”, a kick-ass statuesque private investigator
tough enough to take on the guys at their own game
and sexy enough to dazzle them.
Somehow she manages to lose her top all the time, but it never goes further than that.
The plot is ludicrously complicated, switching gears on every page,
with snappy Mike Hammeresque dialog.

The books inspired a mid-sixties `TV show`_ that Emma remembers with great fondness.
The sex was excised from the show, of course.
