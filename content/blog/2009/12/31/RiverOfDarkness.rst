Inspector John Madden, like so many of his generation,
came back from the Great War a changed man.
When a particularly savage and senseless murder takes place,
he must persuade his superiors at Scotland Yard to adopt
some new and unwelcome practices, such as psychological profiling.

This well-done thriller is as much
about the aftermath of World War I
as it is a police procedural.
