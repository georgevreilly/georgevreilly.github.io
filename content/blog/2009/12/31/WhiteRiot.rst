The Northern English city of Newcastle is on edge as racial tensions have been whipped up.
Joe Donovan's team are asked to investigate a seemingly unrelated case
where a one-time radical is getting threatening calls.

The main characters—Donovan's team and some teenaged no-hopers
way out of their depth in a white supremacist organization—\
are credible and well-drawn.
The plot however relies overly on coincidence after coincidence.
