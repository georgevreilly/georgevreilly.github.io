Paige is a modern young witch.
Her boyfriend, Lucas, despite being the heir apparent to the Cortez Cabal of sorcerers,
wants nothing to do with the family business.
But they get sucked in when the teenaged children of the various cabals are being murdered.

An entertaining urban fantasy that's ridiculously fast-paced.
