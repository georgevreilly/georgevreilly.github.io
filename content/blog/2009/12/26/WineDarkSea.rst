| Aubrey-Maturin #16

After the events of `The Truelove`_,
Aubrey and Maturin set sail for Peru to
undertake the intelligence mission originally begun
four books ago in `The Letter of Marque`_.
O'Brian packs more than usual into this book:
multiple sea battles, the Reverend Martin's descent into madness,
Stephen inciting a revolution of independence against the Spanish,
naturalism high in the Andes, Jack almost being lost at sea in a small boat,
and a nerve-wracking encounter with an American frigate amongst the ice floes of Cape Horn.

Highly recommended.
