Twenty years ago, three twelve-year-olds went into
their local woods in Knocknaree near Dublin.
Hours later, only one was found, catatonic.
Now, under a different name, Rob Ryan is a detective in the Irish Murder Squad
and another twelve-year-old has been murdered in Knocknaree.

Tana French's debut is subtle and gripping.
The story unfolds in unexpected ways.
Ryan's relationship with his partner in detection, Cassie Maddox,
is tested to the breaking point
while he tries to conceal his past and stay on the case.

Highly recommended.
