Many of the screenshots that show up on my blog were captured with `ImageWell`_,
a little Mac app with resizing, uploading, and rudimentary image editing functionality.
It used to be freeware.
Now it costs $20 after the trial period runs out.

`InstantShot!`_ is a menu bar app that does a good job of taking screenshots,
but that's all it does.

`ChocoFlop`_, which I've only just discovered,
seems like the best of the free image editors for the Mac.
The rest are pretty bad.
Nothing as good as `Paint.NET`_ on Windows.

`GIMP on OS X`_ has finally become more or less usable,
but that's heavyweight.
