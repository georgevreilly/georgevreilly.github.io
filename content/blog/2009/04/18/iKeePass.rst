One app that I really want for my iPhone is `iKeePass`_,
an port of the KeePass_ password safe.
I've mentioned it before_.
I'm up to about 400 entries now.
It's completely indispensable to me for keeping track
of not just passwords, but identities,
and which websites I've registered on.

Apple is holding up approval of iKeePass, apparently indefinitely.
It seems to be some combination of not wanting
to approve strong encryption for export
and hangups about open source.
Or something.
Whatever it is, it's damned annoying.

`KeePassX`_ works on Mac and Linux and means that I can move
my password database back and forth to Windows without problem.
Only my iPhone is without some form of KeePass.
