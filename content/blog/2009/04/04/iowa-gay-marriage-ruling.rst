I am greatly heartened by today's news of Iowa's Supreme Court
unanimously striking down the state's gay marriage ban.
The passage of `Proposition 8`_ in California was a setback.
The Iowa Court made a strong ruling_,
gutting the arguments against same-sex marriage.

It's hard to believe now that interracial marriage was illegal
in many states until 1967.
President Obama's parents could not have married in those states.
We look back at that now with bemusement and a little horror.
The opposition, then as now, was led by cultural conservatives,
making `religious arguments`_.

Someday soon, we'll look back at the gay marriage debate
with the same bemusement and wonder what all the fuss was about.
