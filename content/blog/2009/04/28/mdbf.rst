In the late 90s when I worked on the classic Active Server Pages dev team,
I tried to convince one of the Program Managers that
we should make regular updates to `browscap.ini`_,
the file that described browser capabilities.
He wanted no part of it.

I was pleasantly surprised to learn via `Hanselminutes`_
that Microsoft has stepped up to its responsibilities and
is now shipping the `Mobile Device Browser File`_ on CodePlex.
Over 400 mobile devices are defined, with 67 distinct `capabilities`_.

The `Hanselminutes`_ podcast is an interesting discussion of the Mobile Web
and designing a different experience for mobile browsers.
There's more to it than the small screen.
You want to think about the scenarios in which the site is likely to be used.
The user is probably traveling: give directions.
Make phone numbers dialable by using the `tel\: scheme`_.
Think about server round trips.
