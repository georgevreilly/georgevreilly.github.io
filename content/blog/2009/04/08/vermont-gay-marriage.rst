On Friday, the `Iowa Supreme Court`_ struck down their state's
gay marriage ban.
Today, the `Vermont Legislature`_ legalized gay marriage.

It's been a great week for fairness.
We still have a `long way to go`_:
29 states have constitutional amendments banning gay marriage.

I'm sure the right wing are beating the fund-raising drums for all they're worth.
We can expect more Proposition 8-style backlashes, I'm afraid.

But the news still made my day.
