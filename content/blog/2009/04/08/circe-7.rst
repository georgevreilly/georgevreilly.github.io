As I mentioned the `other night`_,
I introduced two narrators into the chapter of Ulysses
that we're reading in June.

I'd say from the rehearsal tonight that the additions are successful,
that they clarify the text for the listener,
without being intrusive.
I expect that I'll have to produce a third draft of the script in a few weeks,
but I think the next round of changes will be minor.
The second draft required hundreds of small changes.

We gained three new readers tonight.
There are plenty of parts to go around, so it's all to the good.
We had great difficulty initially last year in
getting enough readers from the old guard,
until we recruited several new readers.
