I took today off and headed north to the Skagit Valley with Emma and Lyndol
to see the tulips.
It was a glorious spring day,
sunny, not too warm, a light breeze.
The tulip fields were busy for a weekday;
they're completely overrun at the weekends.

We wandered around `Tulip Town`_ for an hour,
had lunch in La Conner,
and headed back to Seattle via Camano Island.

We had intended to take `Chuckanut Drive`_ up to Fairhaven,
but Emma wasn't feeling well.
Some other time.
Chuckanut Drive is pretty year round;
the tulips are good only for another couple of weeks.
