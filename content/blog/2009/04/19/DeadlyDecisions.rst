There are two Dr. Temperance Brennan's.
Both are forensic anthropologists.
One is the heroine of Kathy Reichs' novels,
who, like Reichs herself, is a professor in North Carolina
and works with the Montreal police.
The other is the star of the TV show, *Bones*,
is brilliant but devoid of social skills,
works with the FBI in Washington DC,
and has a state-of-the-art lab and a crack team of geeks.

A war has erupted between biker gangs in Montreal.
Old bones have been found in the ground,
including the skull of a teenaged girl,
whose other bones were found years ago in North Carolina.
Brennan works hard to find evidence that will convict some of the bikers.

The plot moves along briskly,
the characters act like real humans,
and the medical detail is interesting.
Too many threads are implausibly tied together for my liking,
but otherwise I enjoyed it.
