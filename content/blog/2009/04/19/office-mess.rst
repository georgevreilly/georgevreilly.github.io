I fear going into my home office.
It's a huge mess of clutter,
books piled everywhere, boxes of unsorted papers,
crap all over my desk.
(No, it's not as bad as the accompanying photo.)

My office overwhelms me.
As a result, I don't go in there,
except to drop more stuff off and make it worse.
I rarely use the desktop system there.

The living room couch has become my sub-office.
I sit there of an evening and surf the web from my laptop.
I pull out the bills every couple of weeks
and take care of them from the couch.
Then I dump them in the office.

I know what the solution is.
I've known for a long time.
I should go into the office for an hour at a time
and impose order on some section of it.
Repeat often enough and the office will feel welcoming again.
I just spent an hour in there tonight
and dealt with a big pile of books.
The odds of my doing more sorting anytime soon are low, though,
so the problem will persist.
