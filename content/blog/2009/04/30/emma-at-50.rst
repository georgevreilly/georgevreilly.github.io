Emma turned 50 today.
She was a mere (late) thirty-something when I met her.

We had dinner at `The Georgian`_ in the classic Fairmont Olympic hotel.
Until a few years ago, it was the `Four Seasons`_.
The Georgian is in an old-fashioned dining room with soaring ceilings
that mutes the conversation.
The waiters were attentive and made us feel welcome.

The food is not outrageously expensive—\
we both chose to have the *prix fixe* dinner at $49.
I had the wine for an additional $20.
The presentation was superb and we both enjoyed the food.
An asparagus salad, followed by chicken wrapped in apple-smoked bacon,
and the black-and-white soufflé.
Scallops were an alternative to the chicken,
but didn't appeal to either of us.

Happy Birthday, my love.

One week from today, our ninth wedding anniversary.
