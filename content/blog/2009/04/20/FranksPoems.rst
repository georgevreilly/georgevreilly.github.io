I gave a poetry reading tonight, of `Frank Maloney`_'s poems.
I'm working through a book of Interpretive Reading projects
at Freely Speaking Toastmasters.
I had to read some poetry for tonight's project
and Frank's work was an obvious choice.
(Had I remembered, I would have recorded the reading and made a podcast.)

Frank was most active as a poet_ in the 1970s when he published
his collection, `How to Eat a Slug`_.

Six poems follow that give a taste of his work.
The material in [square brackets] I omitted from the reading.


The Illiterate Calligrapher
===========================

Frank was long interested in Chinese and Japanese art
and he used to paint watercolors.

    | I am learning to write a language I cannot read.
    | A few ideas get through: 
    | The character for heart beats truer than a valentine;
    | For bamboo, the node is enough.
    | 
    | Use erodes the pictures like old mountains,
    | Scrapes them clean as a hide,
    | Clean as the glacier’s tracks, down to bedrock, the core.
    | 
    |   [Where I live all is new and getting newer.
    |   The cities, their people: a century is about all we can claim.
    | 
    |   [The Salish, the Nootkas with a longer reach, 
    |   Like their cedar always renewed,
    |   Became their salmon.
    | 
    |   [Even the mountains still rise and stretch,
    |   Unfinished, raw, & unreadable.]
    | 
    | Twelve strokes, movements: suspended needle,
    | Playing butterfly, and phoenix-wing hook.
    | Ink ballets make a few hundred radicals, the roots
    | Of K’ung Fu-tze and Mao Tse-tung.
    | 
    | I copy out a commonplace by rote,
    | Like watching the wave and not seeing the fish.


Alice to Dorothy
================

A letter from Alice, of Wonderland, to Dorothy, of Oz.

        *with apologies to Melinda Mueller*
  
    | It could be spring back in England,
    | If that is the direction; 
    | for all I know it is just around the dogleg in this road
    | That does not seem to know its mind.
    | Perhaps it’s behind a bush.
    | I try not to step on things;
    | England might be under a dry leaf,
    | Buried in the whorls of a snail,
    | Or it may never have happened at all.
    | 
    | I get muddled when I try to think
    | But one does hear rumours. I am sure you must.
    | How we got back.
    | I read it in a book I found here.
    | Seems I was real and you a character,
    | But as for that I think we both behaved well.
    | I grew up and died; you came back in sequels.
    | Yet here I am; I know I saw you once
    | Across a hedgerow. I tried to wave, to catch your eye. 
    | [The air’s as thick as boxwood.]
    | 
    | I felt we had a lot to talk about.
    | I imagine you were busy with some adventure.
    | 
    | In any case, you did not see me or choose to wave.
    | Please answer this letter. I am lonely rather.
    | They did not let me take Dinah,
    | And cats can be quite a comfort.
    | You have Toto, and dogs are such great company.
    | And your friends. They do not make good friends here.
    | 
    | It is a pretty place once you get used to it.
    | Things are much more here
    | Than they ever were back there.
    | A queer sort of hereness that makes it
    | Thicker, taller, brighter, faster.
    | 
    | Sometimes I feel all shadows & cobwebs,
    | Just as if I were a puff of smoke
    | That everyone wanted to blow away.
    | 
    | I cannot ever go away.
    | I am beginning to doubt there is anyplace to go.
    | Wonderland & Beyond the Looking Glass
    | Are the same place, like some great countryseat:
    | Wings, floors, tourelles, crofts;
    | The maze, the amble, outbuildings, the ruins.
    | I know now it is all the same,
    | The same small place.
    | 
    | When you read this, stop.
    | Do not let them push you down the road.
    | Oh, I hear stories how that Mr Baum drives you all;
    | The Rev. Mr Dodgson wanted a lot more from me,
    | But I put my foot down.
    | I was quite insistent I had done my share.
    | 
    | Plant your feet and refuse to stir.
    | Refuse all enticements, all threats.
    | They shan’t harm you.
    | Without you, where would they be?
    | Rusting in a woodlot yet,
    | Mulching the cornfield by now.
    | 
    | As soon as I finish this letter,
    | I shan’t move again, not a muscle.
    | Then we shall surely sift together
    | Like leaves under some great ash.
    | 
    | Wait for me. I need to talk
    | To talk to someone who doesn’t know any riddles.
    | Your friend / Alice.


No Music
========

Frank was a lifelong subscriber to *National Geographic*.

    *"Giraffes frequently cry, but they make no noise."*
    —Associated Press, 22 Sept 1977

    | There are rules for living at great heights
    | Giraffes must stoop, not bend, to keep light.
    | 
    | Keep your footing and your head;
    | Never know a soft, low bed,
    | Lope a snaking, heaving
    | 
    | Neck; loll acacia's thorny leaves.
    | Preserve a mottled dignity despite the horns,
    | Useless as a Caddy's fins. Mourn
    | With un-African silence that none takes quite seriously:
    | The tactless taxonomist who herds you
    | With the unspeakable okapi; 
    | Or the Romans who failed to catch your *gentilesse*
    | And called you the monster *Cameleopardis*.
    | 
    | You know you're head and tail above our carnival,
    | But man & nature have given you a nasty fall.
    | You broke a rule, you accept the price.
    | Yet these damned meddlers, these graceless lice,
    | Would wrap & hoist you, would interfere,
    | And in the end raise you to the jeers
    | Of little men who find their fun
    | In mocking him who dies for love.
  
            | —Frank R. Maloney.
            | September 1977.
            | Published: Blue Heron Press.


The next two poems were written in August 2008,
weeks before Frank's final illness.

For Peggy Maloney, 1915 - 1991
==============================

Frank's relationship with his mother was ... fraught.

    | You hated your real name, Iva Belle.
    | Was it too Southern for your northern life?
    | Too rustic for the Hupmobiles and roadhouses of Boise?
    | You never said why.
    | 
    | So much you never told me; what did you think your job was?
    | You knew guitar, never offered to teach me.
    | Your first husband died impaled on his steering wheel
    | With you trapped beside him.
    | You waited until the last year of your life to mention it.
    | 
    | You held your secrets tighter than an oyster its pearl,
    | Than an octopus its crab, than a tree its ground.
    | 
    | Night and false dawn lit your lies and evasions.
    | What rainy day were you saving your truths for?
    | Did the Depression teach you to hold fast
    | To the truth like a job, any job, whatever the wages? 
    | 
    | I admit you taught me many skills,
    | Like how to be afraid of change, of novelty, of life.
    | Your legacy: worry, insecurity, withdrawal, resentment, and unforgiveness.
    | I am your son, despite all my denials. When I am scared and nervous,
    | My left hand flaps like a landed fish even yours did.
    | I buy love  by forcing food on guests. I wield silence like a stiletto.
    | 
    | Did you know that I stopped liking you
    | Long before you died? I assume I loved you.
    | Sons love their mothers, don’t they?
    | 
    | You died long before your heart stopped,
    | When you retired to your TV, Pall Malls, and Yuban
    | In the mug you never scoured. 
    | To the apartment by the lake you never walked to.
    | 
    | You dropped all the friends who wanted to be close,
    | Waited for the son who only wanted to get away.
    | 
    | You taught me how to be sad,
    | How to waste a life,
    | To pull back and grow a shell,
    | To wait for high tide.

            | —Frank R. Maloney.

Black Cats & Broken Gates
=========================

Frank and his partner of more than 30 years, Lyndol,
had a long succession of cats.
The two most recent are Princess and Blackie.

    | In the half-hay summer grass, a black cat rolls
    | This way and that, relaxed, warm, and safe
    | Behind a fence. The gate never latches on its own,
    | Hangs slightly askew, is watched over
    | By two tutelary aluminum cocker spaniels.
    | 
    | These are complications not native to a black cat’s thinking.
    | In the shade of the vast holly tree,
    | The grass stays green enough to nibble,
    | The shade warm enough to sprawl against,
    | And a human hand close enough to scratch his head.
    | 
    | The black cat gets up, wanders off into the overgrown field,
    | Exploring again what he has patrolled daily for five years.
    | Routine is what he thrives on.
    | Now is the season for lurking, for hunting fat grasshoppers,
    | Not for fretting over broken gates.
    | 
    | The human sits in that same brown & green yard,
    | Sketches the broken gate & its blind guardians,
    | Preserving in his way the moment,
    | Its still, black-cat perfection, not in the sketch,
    | But there in its perfect absence.
  
            | —Frank R. Maloney.
            | August 5 2008.


Finally, a bonus.
I didn't read it, but people tonight were intrigued by the title.

How to Eat a Slug
=================

    | The hardest part is holding it.
    | A joy to drop the curl into steam, parboil it.
    | Quickly, vengefully.
    | 
    | Drain the melted snot away from creek or brake.
    | You run your knife along its belly;
    | Peel off the jaundice, the liver spots,
    | The curving leprosy.
    | Shut your eyes and thrust a thumb
    | Into the half-congealed guts.
    | 
    | What’s left is firm, white, and altogether mild.
    | Garlic, butter, and you’ve escargot.
    | You’ve earned your appetite.

            | —Frank R. Maloney.
            | 12 August 1972.
