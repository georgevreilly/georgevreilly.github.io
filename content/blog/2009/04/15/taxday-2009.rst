    I like paying taxes. With them I buy civilization.

    -- Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.

The accountant completed our return last night.
Usually we have something of a rebate,
so the amount that we owed came as an unwelcome surprise.
It's paid now.
Bah!

I pay taxes willing enough, but “like” is too strong.
We cannot run a complex society without taxes.
There are many functions that the vaunted free market performs poorly if at all:
roads, sewers, schools, police, health care, education, defense, emergencies.
The profit motive is at odds with providing good, dispassionate service.
Government doesn't necessarily do it well either,
especially when it's run by people who are ideologically opposed to taxes.
*Vide* Katrina.
