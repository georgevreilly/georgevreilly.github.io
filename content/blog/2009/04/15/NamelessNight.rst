Seven years ago, “Paul Hardy” was found with his head smashed in.
He recovered physically, but not mentally.
After another accident, his wits come back and a few memories.
Googling for the one name he remembers brings the NSA to his door.
He goes on the run, causing the unravelling of a coverup.

Efficient, well-plotted thriller in the paranoid vein.
The plot is as risible as most such books, but no matter.
Enjoy it for a few hours.
