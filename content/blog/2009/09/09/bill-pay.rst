Paying bills always makes me grumpy.
More than just the drain on my wallet,
it's also the sheer hassle and tedium.

I think it was last year that I finally switched over to using electronic billpay.
(I'm not always an early adopter.)
The hassle is less and I seldom write checks now.

I'd like to know why electronic payments take days, not milliseconds, to clear.
More predatory bank practices, no doubt.

I wrote several checks tonight.
For months I had been putting off renewing my membership
in various do-gooder organizations like the `ACLU`_, the `EFF`_, and `GLAAD`_.
Some I wrote checks to, others I used their online forms.

I'm going to be getting a couple of dozen checks in the next few weeks.
I'm the treasurer of `Freely Speaking Toastmasters`_
and our semi-annual dues are due at World HQ on OctoberÂ 1st.
We had to raise our club dues by $5,
as we moved our meeting location and now have to pay rent.
