Kevin Kerney, deputy chief of the New Mexico State Police,
has just inherited a high-country ranch,
where he finds a dismembered skeleton.

An old-school police procedural (by a real cop)
with believable characters and a not implausible plot.
The prose is a little clumsy, but the story pulled me along.
