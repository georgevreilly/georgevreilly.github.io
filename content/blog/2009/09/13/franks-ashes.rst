Two months after our `memorial`_ for Frank Maloney,
we took the ferry over to Vashon Island to scatter his ashes.
It was a beautiful September day, sunny but not too hot,
and a 20-minute ferry ride was most pleasant.

Kim and Holly fed us lunch at their place
and we all fell in love with their six rescue kittens.
We drove to a secluded beach
and each of us scattered a teaspoon of Frank's ashes upon the waters.
We sat there for a while and talked and wandered.
Then, back to Holly and Kim's for cake and coffee.

I know that Frank would have thoroughly enjoyed the day:
the fine weather, the ferry ride, the beach, and the food.
He would have reveled in the kittens
and shone in the company of his friends,
who continue to miss him.

I took a large number of photos.
The best, somewhat edited, are up at Flickr:
`ferry`_, `kittens`_, and `ashes`_.
