`Twibbon`_ is a service that allows you to overlay a cause's badge
over your Twitter icon.

I created a `Twibbon overlay for Approve71.org`_.

The results look great on Twitter and Twibbon.

Unfortunately, if I save the image and upload it to Facebook as my profile picture,
it doesn't look so good.
Even if I use the FB UI to pan around in the image, the cropping ruins it.

I just mailed `stormideas`_, the people behind Twibbon,
asking if they could do something similar for Facebook profiles.
