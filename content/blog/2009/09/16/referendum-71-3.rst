I attended the Approve Referendum 71 community organization meeting
this evening and came away with several good ideas.

Emma and I are going to organize a fundraiser in late September or early October.
Stay tuned.

I'm getting Freely Speaking Toastmasters and BiNet Seattle to officially
endorse the `Approve Referendum 71`_ campaign.

Large businesses like Microsoft and Boeing endorsed the campaign yesterday.
I'm told a number of small businesses have too.
I'm going to ask our CEO to endorse the campaign.
Robbie was willing to `host Patty Murray at Cozi`_
and to appear in her press releases, so why not.

I offered my technical services to the campaign,
though I'm willing to do grunt work too.
