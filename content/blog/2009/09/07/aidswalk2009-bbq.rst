I held my annual fundraising barbecue for the `AIDS Walk`_ today.
Actually, the weather was so wet this morning that we cooked and ate inside.

I am happy to report that thanks to the generosity of my sponsors,
I have raised $982 of my original goal of $1000.
With three weeks left until the walk,
I am predicting success in reaching my goal.
