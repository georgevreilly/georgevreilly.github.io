In Bram Stoker's 1897 `novel`_, Dracula relocates from Transylvania to London.
Asking themselves, what would Dracula have done in London
before he was killed by Van Helsing,
18 authors wrote unconnected short stories.
Dracula meets the Prince of Wales,
he is observed by the servants,
he terrorizes `Aleister Crowley`_ and `Charles Fort`_ and `Ellen Terry`_,
he even takes the lead in the Pirates of Penzance.

The stories are uneven. None is outstanding.
