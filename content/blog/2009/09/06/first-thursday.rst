On the `First Thursday`_ of every month,
there's an Art Walk around Seattle's Pioneer Square.
All the art galleries stay open late
and thousands of people wander around looking at the art.

It's a shame then that in the four years that I've worked in Pioneer Square,
I've only Art Walked a handful of times.
Maura and Joseph joined us on Thursday
and we spent a pleasant couple of hours talking and wandering around,
mostly through the Tashiro-Kaplan building.
Muhsin was supposed to come too, but couldn't find parking
as the Seahawks played a pre-season game.

There are other First Thursday events:
many of the museums are free after 5pm.
The `Seattle Art Museum`_,
the `Science Fiction Museum and the Experience Music Project`_,
and the `Museum of Flight`_ all are.
