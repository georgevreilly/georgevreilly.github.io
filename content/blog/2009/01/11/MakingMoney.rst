Terry Pratchett was diagnosed with a rare form of early onset Alzheimer's in 2007.
Fortunately, it's not evident in this Discworld_ book.

Moist von Lipwig, con man extraordinaire, finds himself in charge
of the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork and the Royal Mint.
The people don't trust the banks much.
In an effort to get money flowing, he introduces paper money to Ankh-Morpork.
Lipwig, like his creator, is an acute observer of people,
and pulls it off against the odds.

Pratchett does his usual trick of holding a fun-house mirror
up to some aspect of human society.
This time, it's money and economics.
