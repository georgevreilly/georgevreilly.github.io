At 12:44am Monday (Irish Time), Michelle gave birth to a 9lb 8oz boy.
Mother and son are healthy but exhausted.
I'm not sure quite how long the actual labor lasted;
but I think she started late on Saturday.

My nephew is, as yet, unnamed.
David and Michelle have yet to find a boy's name that both of them really like.
Under Irish law, they have three months to do so,
but Michelle hopes to pick a name within a few days at most.

[Update: they named him Harry.]
