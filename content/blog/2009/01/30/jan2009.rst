What a month!

It opened well, when my `nephew Harry`_ was born.
`Frank died`_ a day later.
A `cold`_ dragged me down for over a week.

Last week's `Obama inauguration`_ cheered me up.
He's off to a strong start.
My story about attending the `Bush Sr. inauguration`_
omitted noting that 20 years ago this month,
I emigrated from Ireland.
More on that in some future posts.

Then there were the layoffs.
Emma lost her contract job last week, primarily from having missed a lot
of work due to ill health.
And on Monday, some other friends were laid off,
as were tens of thousands all around the country.

And my gout_ has flared up, though in a mild way.
