Another novel in the Dune_ franchise.
*Paul of Dune* is an interquel,
largely taking place in the decade
between the events of *Dune* and of *Dune Messiah*.

Paul Atreides has become the Emperor of the known galaxy.
A vicious jihad has burst across the empire in his name.
His prescience tells him that it's absolutely necessary
so that mankind can break out of the course that leads to stagnation and destruction.
But billions have died and many more are yet to die.
He is feared and hated.
A rebellion has broken out and must be suppressed.
Attempts are made upon his life.

The main story is woven with extended flashbacks
to Paul's first formative, experience of war,
a few years before *Dune*.
The War of Assassins took a toll on Paul's father, Duke Leto,
but showed Paul what it is to lead.

The last book written by BH & KJA, `Sandworms of Dune`_,
was a sequel to the entire series.
It was greatly weakened by multiple *deus ex machina* endings.
Here, they are constrained by having to fit in between
two previous books.
This book works better.
