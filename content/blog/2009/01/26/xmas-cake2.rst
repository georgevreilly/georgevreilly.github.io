I made `royal icing <http://www.joyofbaking.com/RoyalIcing.html>`_ last night for the
`Christmas Cake </blog/2007/01/05/ChristmasCake.html>`_ to put over
the `marzipan </blog/2007/01/05/ChristmasCake.html>`_.
A very tedious half hour with an electric handheld mixer
to beat the egg whites until they were stiff, and then beat in the powdered sugar.

The recipe that I used from an old Joy of Cooking called for the juice of 1 lemon.
I used ReaLemon which says that 3 tablespoons = 1 lemon.
I added two tablespoons, which was quite lemony.
The recipe that I've linked to calls for two teaspoons, which seems like a better choice.

I had drizzled whiskey over the cake several times to keep it moist.
That was a mistake.
The cake turned out to be quite damp.

Before baking the cake in November,
I had also thoroughly soaked the dried fruit
for a couple of days in hot water and whiskey.
The fruit was very plump,
but with hindsight,
I think I should have thoroughly drained the soaked fruit for some hours.

Still, it tastes good, but it could be better.
