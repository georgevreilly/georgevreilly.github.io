I made `royal icing`_ last night for the `Christmas Cake`_
to put over the marzipan_.
A very tedious half hour with an electric handheld mixer
to beat the egg whites until they were stiff,
and then beat in the powdered sugar.

The recipe that I used from an old *Joy of Cooking*
called for the juice of 1 lemon.
I used `ReaLemon`_ which says that 3 tablespoons = 1 lemon.
I added two tablespoons, which was quite lemony.
The recipe that I've linked to calls for two teaspoons,
which seems like a better choice.

I had drizzled whiskey over the cake several times to keep it moist.
That was a mistake.
The cake turned out to be quite damp.

Before baking the cake in November,
I had also thoroughly soaked the dried fruit
for a couple of days in hot water and whiskey.
The fruit was very plump, but with hindsight,
I think I should have thoroughly drained the soaked fruit for some hours.

Still, it tastes good, but it could be better.
