My nephew's name is Harold Mark Bowles, to be known as Harry.
I assume the Mark is after my brother.
No idea about the Harold/Harry.

I said before_ that my mother was very excited at becoming a grandmother.
Here's the proof: take a look at the huge smile on her face.

On Christmas Day, she was trying to decide what her new title was to be.
She was really pleased at becoming a granny,
but not at all eager to be known as “Granny”.
She tried out “Nan Et” (Et for Ethna), which we promptly turned into “Nanette”.
“Gran Et” was even worse: with a strong Dublin accent it becomes “Granite”.
She has decided that she will be known as “Nana”.

My grandmother Reilly was known to us all as “Gam”.
It's my fault.
I was the oldest grandchild and I couldn't say “Gran”,
so I called her “Gam”—and it stuck.
Almost. Some of our cousins heretically called her “Gan”.
I was definitively wrong, dammit!
