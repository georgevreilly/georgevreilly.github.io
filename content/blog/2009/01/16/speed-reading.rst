I've always been a fast reader, faster than most people.
I've read and reviewed 176 books in just over two years,
or about two books a week.
That doesn't count newspapers, magazines, blogs, and other online reading.

When I was 10, I had an operation on both my feet
and I spent all summer with my legs in plaster.
My mother had to go to the library every day
because they'd only let her take out three books at a time for me.
On the flight back from Ireland two weeks ago,
I read two_ 500-page books_.
My personal best, though, was the long, long night that
I read seven short novels.

I've known people who read faster than me, but not many.
One friend at college seemed to read about twice as fast as me.

I just tried a couple of online reading speed tests,
which rated me at 650-700 words per minute.
One of the tests also indicated that online reading
is slower than reading a book.

A reviewer for the LA Times read `462 books last year`_.
I might be able to do that if I had nothing else to do.
She talks about ripping through an 80,000 word book in 90 minutes.
A number of the commenters claimed to be ultra-fast readers too.

I've never taken a speed reading course.
I naturally developed a high reading speed.
My comprehension and short-term retention is good.
My long-term retention is not great,
but this is equally true for movies that I've watched.

I think my high reading speed is why I have no patience for podcasts.
I can read five times faster than anyone can talk intelligibly.
Unless there's a lot of additional information in the soundtrack,
such as music or an unusually talented delivery,
I'd much rather read.

There are screen readers that will speak at `triple speed`_
for blind users:
‘To the untrained ear, the output is incomprehensible,
but it allows [T.V.] Raman to “read” at
roughly the same speed as a sighted person.’

Read on!
