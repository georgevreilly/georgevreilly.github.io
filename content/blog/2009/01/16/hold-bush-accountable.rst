Paul Krugman_:

    Last Sunday President-elect Barack Obama was asked whether he would seek an
    investigation of possible crimes by the Bush administration. “I don’t
    believe that anybody is above the law,” he responded, but “we need to look
    forward as opposed to looking backwards.”

    I’m sorry, but if we don’t have an inquest into what happened during the
    Bush years — and nearly everyone has taken Mr. Obama’s remarks to mean that
    we won’t — this means that those who hold power are indeed above the law
    because they don’t face any consequences if they abuse their power.

    …

    There’s much, much more. By my count, at least six important government
    agencies experienced major scandals over the past eight years — in most
    cases, scandals that were never properly investigated. And then there was
    the biggest scandal of all: Does anyone seriously doubt that the Bush
    administration deliberately misled the nation into invading Iraq? 

    Why, then, shouldn’t we have an official inquiry into abuses during the
    Bush years?

    …

    Now, it’s true that a serious investigation of Bush-era abuses would make 
    Washington an uncomfortable place, both for those who abused power and 
    those who acted as their enablers or apologists. And these people have a 
    lot of friends. But the price of protecting their comfort would be high: If 
    we whitewash the abuses of the past eight years, we’ll guarantee that they 
    will happen again.

    …

    And to protect and defend the Constitution, a president must do more than
    obey the Constitution himself; he must hold those who violate the
    Constitution accountable. So Mr. Obama should reconsider his apparent
    decision to let the previous administration get away with crime.
    Consequences aside, that’s not a decision he has the right to make.

The Democrats, with rare exceptions like Conyers and Kucinich,
have shown no appetite for holding the Bush Administration accountable.
Between starting the Iraq War, torture, billions given in no-bid contracts,
Katrina, the U.S. Attorneys' firings, wiretapping U.S. citizens,
and much, much more,
there's a lot that needs investigating.
And surely there's more that hasn't come to light yet.

Letting bygones be bygones just condones the crimes.
It will certainly be politically inconvenient to have some accountability,
but it's the right thing to do.

I'm not going to hold my breath, however.
