I made my `Christmas Cake`_ back in November,
but am only now getting around to putting on the icing.
I've kept it moist with several applications of whiskey.

Last year, I made marzipan_ from scratch.
Never again!
It was a huge amount of work to blanch the almonds
and the stiff mixture of sugar and almonds caused the
food processor to seize up more than once.

I didn't use up all the marzipan that I made that time.
I put the remainder into a sealed container,
placed it in the fridge, and forgot all about it.
When I took it out of the fridge yesterday,
it was still good.
Oh, the top half-inch had hardened
and the rest was a tad dry,
but it was good enough to use.
I rolled it out and draped it over the cake.

I'll add a layer of royal icing at the weekend
and let it harden overnight.

And then I'm going to eat it.
