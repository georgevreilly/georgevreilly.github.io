I mentioned Copilot_ a while back as a way of helping someone
by connecting remotely to their desktop.

CrossLoop_ is another such service.
If you want to charge someone for helping them out,
CrossLoop will take a cut.
Otherwise, unlike Copilot, it's completely free.
Unfortunately, it's Windows only:
there's no Mac or Linux clients.

I've used it a couple of times to connect to my parents' computers
in Dublin and Cape Town.
It works well, though it's still painfully slow.

This morning's problem:
My father was no longer seeing images in his Yahoo mail.
Somehow, he had managed in Firefox to block images
on his Yahoo mail server,
and only on his Yahoo mail server.
