`Salumi's`_ has the best selection of charcuterie_ in Seattle.
The range and quality of their cured meats is truly impressive.
The flavor, excellent.
Their counter staff, friendly and family-like.
The line goes out the door.

But. But. But.

Their service is wretched.
That line moves at a glacial pace.
I've never taken less than 20 minutes to get a sandwich;
sometimes twice that.
The staff are slow and inefficient.
Their stations are badly laid out
and they have to fumble around each other
in their pokey little store.

Every time I watch them at work—and I always
have plenty of time to watch them work—I want
to drag them over to `Jimmy John's`_ or `Bakeman's`_.
Jimmy John's is fast, efficient, and cheerful.
Bakeman's is fast, brusque, and serves up a side of attitude.
But, by God, you get a sandwich in five minutes or less.

Salumi's could double their speed and still be Salumi's.
I wish they would.
