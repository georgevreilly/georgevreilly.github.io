I seldom get bad colds, but I caught one on the plane back from Ireland,
and it's left me drained of energy for the last ten days.
Jet lag and Frank's death surely contributed too.
Feh!

Maybe I'll be up to cycling into work tomorrow.
Between the snow, being in Ireland for two weeks, and this cold,
it's been almost a month since I last rode in.
