Sequel to `The Purity of Blood`_.

Captain Alatriste has rejoined the Spanish army in Flanders,
besieging Breda_ in 1625.
Íñigo, his follower and later biographer, is still too young to bear arms,
and serves as a forager for Alatriste's squad.

There's no glory in this war—Pérez-Reverte is a former war correspondent.
The Spanish empire is on the decline.
Spain has been fighting in the `Spanish Netherlands`_ for sixty years
to suppress the Protestant heretics.
The Spanish troops are mutinous and close to starving;
they haven't been paid in a long time.
All they have is their honor and that, they guard zealously.

A grim tale of privation and battle, well told.
