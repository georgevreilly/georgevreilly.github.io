    :alt: Obama's Inauguration Speech
    :class: right-float

Eight years ago, the Onion published a supposed speech
by then President-elect George Bush, called
‘Our `Long National Nightmare`_ Of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over’.
How prophetic!

Finally, the long national nightmare of the George W. Bush presidency is over.

Barack Obama took the oath of office today.
His `inaugural speech`_ was somber, reasoned, cautionary, and
inspirational—of a piece with the man.

He faces enormous difficulties.
There are enormous opportunities too, if he can but seize them.
The polls say that the American people do not expect overnight miracles.
I hope we will all remember that a year from now.

Here's to Obama and his presidency.
