It's time to start thinking about this year's reading of `Ulysses`_
for the `Wild Geese Players of Seattle`_.
The next chapter to be tackled is Circe_,
the nightmare scene in the brothel.

Most chapters require a lot of work to tease apart into a staged reading,
to make sense of the different threads of Bloom's inner monologue,
or to attribute fragments of conversation to different characters, for example.
This chapter is written in the form of a play;
attribution is easy.

But *Circe* is also *enormously* long: some 60,000 words.
For comparison, many novels are in the range 80â€“100,000 words.
`Last year's chapter`_ was 20,000 words and I cut 5,000 words off.
It took us the best part of two hours to read those 15,000 words.
Clearly, we cannot read the whole chapter.
Even if we had the stamina to read for six or seven hours,
no audience would put up with it.

My task for this weekend, then, is to re-read the chapter
and see whether it makes more sense
to simply cut the hell out of it,
so that we can complete *Circe* this year,
or to divide it into two or three pieces,
which will have to be read at different times.
