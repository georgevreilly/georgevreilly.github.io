For a long time, I disliked Facebook.
It seemed to consist entirely of annoying acquaintances
attacking me with vampires or sending me pointless “gifts”.

I've used Facebook more in the last month
and it's been less annoying than I remembered it.
I check it once or twice a day and see updates
from people I know.
More entertaining than exasperating.

Twitter_, though, has not clicked for me.
Brevity is good, but Twitter is too minimalist.
Stream-of-consciousness ejaculations.
Opaque URLs disdaining explanation.
Feh.

`Scott Hanselman`_ has a different take on Twitter.

Maybe I need to “follow” a better class of people.

I'll go and yell at those damn kids to get off my lawn now.
