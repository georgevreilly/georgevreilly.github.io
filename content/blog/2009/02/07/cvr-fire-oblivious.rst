I talked to my mother this afternoon.
She's still in Dublin, helping Michelle out with Harry.
My father went back to Cape Town in mid-January
to enjoy the golf and the South African summer.
My parents spend several months a year there.

They have a small cottage in Hout Bay,
in a residential complex.
The buildings are terraced together.
The other night, the cottage two doors down caught fire
and the woman inside died.
My father slept through the whole commotion forty feet from his bedroom,
and knew nothing about it until the next day.

We knew he was a sound sleeper—and a heavy snorer—but this tops everything.
