I have a long-standing fascination with typography.
In the late '80s and early '90s, I became quite `adept with TeX and LaTeX`_,
the well-known `scientific typesetting system`_.
When I was at ICPC_, I think I read the TeXbook_ cover to coverâ€”twice.
I became the TeX administrator for the CS department while I was at Brown.

And then I moved to Seattle to work for Microsoft
and entered the world of Windows,
and I left TeX behind for more than 15 years.

I wrote the other day that I prepared the Bloomsday_ scripts in XML_
for several years, using XSLT to generate HTML.
I used to send the HTML to the readers,
but everyone's browser paginated differently when printing,
which led to confusion at rehearsals.
So I started giving them PDFs:
problem solved except for the person who needed a large-print version.

Last year, I prepared the script with `reStructuredText`_.
Normally, I use reST to generate HTML,
but reST can also generate LaTeX.
I decided to use `rst2latex`_ to take advantage of LaTeX's superior typesetting.

I wasn't happy with the results.
The script looked like a crappy technical paper from the '90s,
thanks to the tired `Computer Modern`_ layout.
CM works well for math, less well for text, in my opinion.

The MacTeX_ extras included XeTeX_,
a modern variant of TeX that supports Unicode and OpenType fonts.
I experimented with using Hoefler_ to set the script.
You can see the results above: it looks gorgeous.

More to come.
