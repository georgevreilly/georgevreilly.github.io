I like `Stack Overflow`_, Jeff Atwood's programming Q&A site.
It's quickly become a go-to place for all kinds of programming questions.
It's certainly easier to find a definitive answer there
than trying to wade through a thread in a mailing list archive.
The social dynamics seem to be working
and a definite community has evolved.

I've been going there more often recently.
I browse the hot questions and I often learn something from them.

I'm answering some questions too.
I've been doing this for twenty years on Usenet and mailing lists.
I might as well get a little credit for it on SO.
My reputation is 131 as I write this: I expect it will grow.
