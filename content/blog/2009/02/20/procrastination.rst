Aaron Swartz has a moderately interesting piece
on `productivity and procrastination`_.

We all procrastinate.
I certainly procrastinate.

Sometimes my procrastination is tantamount to
making sure that my pencils are very, very sharp.
More often, I find myself surfing the web,
free associating off in random directions.
There's no end to the fascinating distractions.

In lesser cases, I procrastinate because I'm bored
or not fully engaged in what I'm doing.

When I have a more severe case,
I think fear is the root cause.
I don't really know how to proceed,
I don't really understand what it is that I'm supposed to be doing,
and I don't really want to come to grips with it.
And so I don't.
My fear of the pain dissuades me.

When I finally do get over the hump, quite often,
I'll find myself engaged in the problem and have difficulty tearing myself away.
I develop a sense of accomplishment about the problem.
At best, I find myself in a state of flow_.

The key to my getting started seems to be
to find some small, manageable piece that I can accomplish.
The momentum gets me on to the next piece and then the next.

Easier said than done, alas.
