Apple launched the public `Safari 4 beta`_ today.

It runs beautifully on Vista and it's the fastest browser that I've seen,
noticeably faster than Chrome.
Everything that I tried worked fairly well;
I saw only a few minor glitches.

I installed it on my MacBook at home this evening.
It crashes at startup every time that I attempt to run it.
Fortunately, it comes with an uninstaller so that I could revert to Safari 3.21.

Back to Opera_ for now.
