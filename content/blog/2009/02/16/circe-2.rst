    :alt: Fragment of Cyclops script

I'm about halfway through the 60,000-word Circe_ chapter of Ulysses,
converting it to LaTeX.

For several years,
I took the plaintext from the `Project Gutenberg etext`_,
`prepared the script in XML`_,
used XSLT to transform it into HTML,
tarted it up with CSS,
and then saved it as a PDF_.
You can see a screenshot above.

I'll write up tomorrow why I switched to LaTeX last year.
