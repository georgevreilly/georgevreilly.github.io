Sequel to `For a Few Demons More`_.
Best read in sequence.

Rachel Morgan: witch and private investigator.
An unknown enemy is summoning a demon every night to kill her.
She learns some surprising things about her past
and her place in the world.

Previous books were heavy on the action;
here it kicks in very late and the book is very talky.

Moderately entertaining but weaker than earlier books in the series.
