My talented wife got back today from four days at the
`Madrona Fiber Arts Festival`_ in Tacoma.
As you can see from `Emma's Flickr page`_,
she's knit a lot of beautiful pieces.

I'm hoping she will revive her `dormant blog`_
and write more about some of her projects.
She does have some writeups at `Ravelry`_ (Facebook for knitters)
under her username ``Emma``, but that's only visible to members.
