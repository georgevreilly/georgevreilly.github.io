| Title: Taken
| Director: Pierre Morel
| Rating: ★ ★ ★ 
| Copyright: 2008

Liam Neeson is Bryan Mills, a former CIA “preventer” who reluctantly
lets his teenaged daughter visit Paris.
Kim is abducted by an Albanian prostitution ring
and he sets out to rescue her.
Non-stop mayhem and action ensue.

*Taken* works fairly effectively as an action movie in the *Bourne* mode.
The plot moves fast enough that you don't have time to
reflect upon the gaping holes or
the improbable effectiveness and invincibility of Mills.

Neeson carries the movie, convincing as the pissed-off hardass
who'll go to any lengths to find his daughter.
