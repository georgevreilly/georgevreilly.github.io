`Frank Rich`_ in Sunday's paper on the Republicans who've run out of ideas:

    The crisis is at least as grave as the one that confronted us — and, 
    for a time, united us — after 9/11. Which is why the antics among 
    Republicans on Capitol Hill seem so surreal. These are the same 
    politicians who only yesterday smeared the patriotism of any dissenters 
    from Bush’s “war on terror.” Where is their own patriotism now that 
    economic terror is inflicting far more harm on their constituents than 
    Saddam Hussein’s nonexistent W.M.D.?

    …

    The current G.O.P. acts as if it — and we — have all the time in the 
    world. It kept hoping in vain that the fast-waning Blago sideshow would 
    somehow impale Obama or Rahm Emanuel. It has come perilously close to 
    wishing aloud that a terrorist attack will materialize to discredit 
    Obama’s reversals of Bush policy on torture, military tribunals and 
    Gitmo. The party’s sole consistent ambition is to play petty politics 
    to gum up the works.

`David Leonhardt`_ discusses ideas in *The Big Fix* in the NYT Magazine:

    Rahm’s Doctrine[:] “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,” 
    Emanuel said. “What I mean by that is that it’s an opportunity to do 
    things you could not do before.”

    …

    Germany and Japan, on the other hand, were forced to rebuild their 
    economies and political systems after the war. Their interest groups 
    were wiped away by the defeat. “In a crisis, there is an opportunity to 
    rearrange things, because the status quo is blown up,” Frank Levy, an 
    M.I.T. economist and an Olson admirer, told me recently. If a country 
    slowly glides down toward irrelevance, he said, the constituency for 
    reform won’t take shape. [Mancur] Olson’s insight was that the defeated 
    countries of World War II didn’t rise in spite of crisis. They rose 
    because of it.

    …

    ONE GOOD WAY TO UNDERSTAND the current growth slowdown is to think of 
    the debt-fueled consumer-spending spree of the past 20 years as a 
    symbol of an even larger problem. As a country we have been spending 
    too much on the present and not enough on the future. We have been 
    consuming rather than investing. We’re suffering from 
    investment-deficit disorder.

    …

    WASHINGTON’S CHALLENGE on energy policy is to rewrite the rules so that 
    the private sector can start building one of tomorrow’s big industries. 
    On health care, the challenge is keeping one of tomorrow’s industries 
    from growing too large.

    …

    In Orszag’s final months on Capitol Hill, he specifically argued that 
    health care reform should not wait until the financial system has been 
    fixed. “One of the blessings in the current environment is that we have 
    significant capacity to expand and sell Treasury debt,”

    …

    Goldin’s and Katz’s thesis is that the 20th century was the American 
    century in large part because this country led the world in education. 
    The last 30 years, when educational gains slowed markedly, have been 
    years of slower growth and rising inequality.
