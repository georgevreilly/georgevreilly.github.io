`Kubota Garden`_ is a little-known gem in the Rainier Beach area of south Seattle.
Twenty acres of hills and valleys in a Japanese style.

Emma and I met Lyndol down there this morning
and rambled through the garden for two hours.
It was a fine, overcast day, with temperatures in the low 60s and occasional drizzle—\
and a pleasant relief from the record heat of earlier this week.
I had visited there before:
it's at the far end of the `Chief Sealth bicycle trail`_.
Lyn had too, but it was Emma's first visit.

The gate was locked when we arrived at 10:30,
though the sign proclaimed that it was open from 6am until sunset.
We walked in anyway.
It was still locked when we left,
but a few others also found their way in.

We climbed up the “Mountainside” to the top of the turned-off waterfall,
we crossed all the bridges,
we found Mapes Creek.
Fujitaro Kubota bought swampland in 1927,
but most of it has been drained since.

I resisted the urge to take photos for about half an hour,
but a grove of `twisted trees`_ compelled me
to whip my point-and-shoot off my belt.
The best photos can be found at Flickr_.
