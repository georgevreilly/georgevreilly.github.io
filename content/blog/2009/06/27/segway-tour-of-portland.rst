I rode on a Segway today, for the first time.
It was a lot of fun: a two-hour of Portland's waterfront
with nine other motsscon people.
I could have done without the 80Â°F heat though.

It took a few minutes for me to find my balance and to feel comfortable.
After that, it came pretty naturally.

Highly recommended.
