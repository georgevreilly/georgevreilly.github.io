Perhaps the most irrefutable sign of middle age for me
was getting `progressive lenses`_ six months ago.

I had noticed for several months that I was having a little difficulty with smaller print,
and a visit to the optometrist confirmed that I needed reading glasses.
Now I'm near-sighted and far-sighted, all at the same time.

The new glasses took some getting used to.
I had been accustomed to looking through any part of the lens.
Now I had to tilt my head downwards rather than simply turn my eyes down,
if I wanted to look at the floor,
or I'd be looking through the short-distance reading portion.

These lenses are also noticeably heavier than my older glasses.
On a couple of occasions, I've had to wear different glasses
for a few days, to give a rest to the pressure spots on the bridge of my nose.
