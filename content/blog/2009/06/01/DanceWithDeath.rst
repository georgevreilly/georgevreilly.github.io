Inspector Çetin İkmen is called to a remote village in Cappadocia
when a 20-year-old mummified body is found.
The case is tearing the village apart.
Back in İstanbul, Inspector Mehmet Süleyman investigates
an increasingly violent series of male-on-male rapes.

Nadel clearly knows Turkey well,
bringing to life characters from different social classes
without patronizing them,
showing Turkey in its complexity.
The story was well crafted, weaving the two strands together
to highlight tension.
*Pace* a pet peeve of mine, the two cases did not suddenly,
magically become related by the end of the book.
The Agatha Christiesque denouement of İkmen's case was a bit much, though.
