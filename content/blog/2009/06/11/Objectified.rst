| Title: Objectified
| Director: Gary Hustwit
| Rating: ★ ★ ★ ½
| Copyright: 2009

*Objectified* is a documentary about industrial design
and the manufactured objects that litter our lives.
In interviews with some leading designers,
Hustwit brings forth such topics as
our emotional attachment to those objects;
the ephemerality and planned obsolesence of most of this “stuff”;
the approaches of different designers;
designing the manufacturing process as well as the object;
how good design often almost disappears;
sustainability, when most objects end up in landfill;
interaction and interface design;
etc.

The danger with such a broad survey
is that you can't do justice to anything.
I was left wanting to know more about many of the topics.
In the Q&A afterwards, Hustwit mentioned that they shot
80 hours of footage.
Most of the designers were interesting and articulate;
only a couple came across as pretentious twats.

Update: comparing_ Dieter Ram's designs for Braun in the Sixties
and Jonny Ive's work for Apple today.
