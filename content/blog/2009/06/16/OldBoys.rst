Paul Christopher, septuagenarian and former superspy,
was last seen in a remote Chinese province.
His ashes are delivered to his cousin Horace, also a retired spy,
who is not convinced that the ashes belong to Paul.
Then he learns that Paul is on the trail of Ibn Awad,
a mad sultan with nukes who covets a first-century manuscript
(a Roman spymaster's report on Jesus) that is thought to be
in the possession of Paul's 94-year-old mother, who hasn't seen since 1940,
when she was abducted by the Nazi `Reinhard Heydrich`_.
So Horace recruits a handful of creaky-kneed retired spies and goes after Paul.

Anyway.

If you can get over the wild improbability of the plot,
it's actually well-written, coherent, and plausible on its own terms.
