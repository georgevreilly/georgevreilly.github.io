I walked past this truck at Second and Pike on Monday and did a double-take.
Eric was intrigued too when I showed him a photo later,
and we went back to investigate yesterday.

They only opened a few weeks ago.
As yet, the menu is limited.
The Maximus is a pulled pork sandwich with a hot sauce,
while the Minimus has a tangy sauce.
They have a vegetarian sandwich, chips made from potatoes and vegetables,
and hibiscus and ginger lemonades.

I don't much care for barbecue as a rule.
The Minimus with a sprinkling of Beecher's cheese was good, but not outstanding.
The pork was flavorful and not overwhelmed by the sauce.
The sandwich was a little small and inevitably messy.
The ginger lemonade was pleasantly tart.
See Yelp_ for more reviews.

The pig is very cool and undoubtedly draws a lot of business.
There's nowhere to sit near the Pig.
We sat down at First and Union and looked down at the waterfront.

I'll be back. Occasionally.
