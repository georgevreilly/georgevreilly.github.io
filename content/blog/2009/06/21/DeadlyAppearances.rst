Andy Boychuk has just become the leader of the opposition party in Saskatchewan
when he is murdered.
His advisor, Joanne Kilbourn, sees him drink the poison.
Her own husband was senselessly murdered a few years earlier,
and Andy was not only her boss but an old friend, so it's difficult for her.
When she decides to write a biography of Andy
and learns unexpected things about him,
her health mysteriously begins to fail.

Joanne is a middle-aged widow with children,
who has spent her life working behind the scenes in Saskatchewan politics.
She is a shrewd judge of character and a perceptive observer,
albeit with human frailties and blind spots.
This is the first of a series of novels.
