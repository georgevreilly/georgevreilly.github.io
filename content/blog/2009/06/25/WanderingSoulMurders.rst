Sequel to `Murder at the Mendel`_.
Teenage prostitutes are being mutilated and murdered in Regina.
Joanne Kilbourn and her family become entangled
with some of these “disposable” girls,
in a case that touches too closely to home.

In the previous novels, her children were important secondary characters.
Here they become central to the story, each in their own way.
