I'm heading down to Portland tomorrow evening for `Motsscon XXII`_,
of which more later.

It seems no-one thought to set up a map of the events and restaurants,
so I spent half an hour in Google Maps creating a `custom map`_.
It was surprisingly painless and the suggestions for businesses near an address
really helped.

**Update**: 10 minutes after writing the above,
Google Maps crashed SafariÂ 4 while trying to print the map.
