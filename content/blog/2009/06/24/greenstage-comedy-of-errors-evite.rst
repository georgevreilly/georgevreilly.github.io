Greenstage continue their Shakespeare in the Park this year
with performances of King John and `Comedy of Errors`_
at a number of Seattle-area parks over the summer.
Emma and I enjoyed their Twelfth Night at Seward Park last year.
Best of all, it's free!

The play starts at 7:00pm.
Come at 5:00 and have a picnic with us near the `Amphitheater`_.
Bring food that's ready to eatâ€”the `Seward Park PCC`_ is less than a mile away.
There's some seating but you might want to bring your own chairs.

If you come even earlier, `Seward Park`_ is worth a trip in its own right.
Old growth forest trails and a 2.5 mile lakefront walk.

Please RSVP to the `Evite`_.
Feel free to invite more people to join us.
