I filled six densely packed barrels with yard waste today,
before and after the victory barbecue for the Wild Geese Players.
No wonder I'm tired.

Three barrels from the pile of clippings left over
from circumcising the camelia tree on Memorial Day weekend,
and another three from the big bush that Emma hates in the front rock garden.
The latter barely looks pruned at all.
