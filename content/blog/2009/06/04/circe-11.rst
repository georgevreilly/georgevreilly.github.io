I just spent over an hour wrestling with the Address Book in Evite,
trying to convince it to import a pile of freeform addresses, to no avail.
I had to paste them in one-by-one, clicking Add for each one.
Feh.

I succeeded in my bigger goal and that was to send out an
`Evite for our Bloomsday Reading`_.
It'll give us some idea of how many to expect at the reading.
