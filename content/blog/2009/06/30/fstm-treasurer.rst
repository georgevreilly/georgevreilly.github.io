The Toastmasters year closes tomorrow.
We held our Annual Meeting tonight at `Freely Speaking Toastmasters`_
and elected a new set of officers.
One new person was elected to the board,
replacing the one person who stepped down,
but everyone except the VP Education and the Webmaster changed roles.
I am the outgoing Secretary and the incoming Treasurer,
and I also continue as the Webmaster.
