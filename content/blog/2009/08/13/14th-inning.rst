Tonight was the annual Irish Night at the Mariners
and we bought tickets for $11.

Even after 20 years in the States,
I still know next to nothing about baseball.
I picked up a copy of the `Baseball Field Guide`_
before last year's Irish Night,
and found the first chapter very helpful in explaining the basics.
I re-read it last night and it helped me follow tonight's game.

Neither the Mariners nor the White Sox could score a run.
Inning after inning the game went on, zero-zero.
No one had scored by the bottom of the ninth, so play continued.
A tenth inning.
An eleventh.
We called it a night and took the new Light Rail to Beacon Hill.

The game finished in the 14th inning when the Mariners finally `pulled ahead`_.
