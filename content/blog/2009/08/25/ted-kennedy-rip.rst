`Ted Kennedy died tonight`_, at the age of 77,
after a year-long battle with brain cancer.
He was, according to `Wikipedia`_,
the third-longest-serving senator of all time,
elected in 1962, as soon as he became eligible at 30.

He was a great liberal and he accomplished much_.
He will be remembered for much more than
being the youngest brother of Jack and Bobby Kennedy.
