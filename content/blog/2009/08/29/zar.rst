I had about 60 apparently corrupted photos on a CompactFlash card this evening.
It might have been due to Lightroom going berserk,
but it was more likely from my pulling the card reader out of the computer
without ejecting it first.

The photos wouldn't show up under Mac, Linux, or Windows.
I tried to ``chkdsk`` the card under Windows, which complained about a “raw” disk.
That led me to `ZAR`_, the Zero Assumption Recovery toolkit.
The evaluation copy retrieved the photos very nicely.
Whew!
