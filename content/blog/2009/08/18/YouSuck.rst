Tommy Flood is another of Chris Moore's `Beta Males`_.
He's also a brand-new 19-year-old vampire, newly turned by his girlfriend Jody—\
herself only a vampire for a few months.
He's not too keen about his new state, but he's trying to cope.
It doesn't help that his former crew of shelf stockers at Safeway
are trying to hunt his vampire ass.
And he has a 16-year-old Goth chick for a minion who thinks
the Lord Flood is like OMG totally hot.

Funny but not mean-spirited.
