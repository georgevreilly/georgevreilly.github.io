Before we left on our trip, I picked up a pair of 4GBÂ SD cards
for my point-and-shoot Canon Elph.
I brought my `Linux netbook`_ along, which has a built-in SD card reader,
and the cards worked fine with that.

But they didn't work at all in any of the external card readers that I have,
and I had to resort to a USB cable to transfer photos from
the camera to my other computers.

Wikipedia discusses `compatibility issues with 2GB and larger SD cards`_,
which is initially what I thought the problem was.
On looking more closely at the cards, I see that they're the newer SDHC cards.
The card readers were all a few years old and must have preceded the SDHC standard.

I spent $7.99 on a new card reader this evening, which supports SDHC
and most of the other small card formats.
