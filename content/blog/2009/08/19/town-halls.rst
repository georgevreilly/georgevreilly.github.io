    Barney Frank Confronts Woman at Town Hall
    </div>

Those town halls are getting uglier.

A dozen gun-toting paranoid guys walking around at Obama's town hall in Arizona yesterday,
some of them with ties to the violent `Viper Militia`_.

In the video above,
Barney Frank takes a question from some woman who's comparing Obama to a Nazi
and tells her she's talking “vile, contemptible nonsense”.

I hope it's not going to escalate into outright violence.
