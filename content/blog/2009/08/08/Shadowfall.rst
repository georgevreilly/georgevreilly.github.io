For four thousand years, the gods have dwelt in human form
amongst the people of Myrillia, rooted to the very land.
When the goddess Meeryn is found murdered and the disgraced Shadowknight
Tylar de Noche is found at her side, miraculously healed of his maiming,
he is accused of being the godslayer.
He escapes and uncovers a dark conspiracy of corruption and evil.

As an exercise in world building, this book succeeds.
For example, the gods' *humors*\ —blood, seed, menses, sweat, tears, saliva, phlegm,
and yellow bile and black bile (“piss and shite”)—are collected by their acolytes,
since they contain the much-treasured Grace, the blessings of the gods.
The writing, however, is clumsy and the plot, pedestrian.

Mildly enjoyable.
