| Director: Henrik Ruben Genz

I saw *Terribly Happy* at SIFF_ tonight.

Robert is a Copenhagen cop, demoted to a remote village in the bleak bogs of Jutland.
The locals are clannish and do things their own way.
Robert quickly finds himself coming between
the man-hungry Ingerlise and her abusive husband Jørgen.
She complains about Jørgen, but won't swear out a formal report.
Robert is unwillingly drawn to her.

Billed as a “blackly comic thriller”, it's more of a psychological drama.
Robert's unsmiling face carries the film.
