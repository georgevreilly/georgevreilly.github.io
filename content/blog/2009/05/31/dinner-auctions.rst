Other people must think I'm a grown up or something.
I've been invited to a couple of dinner auctions in the last year.
We were invited to one for `Choral Arts`_ tonight
by one of the primary organizers.
Emma was feeling unwell, so I went by myself.

I flat out made a donation and bought some raffle tickets.
I also won two modest items in the auction,
tickets for `Arts West`_ and five voice lessons.

I have little natural aptitude for music.
I found it difficult to keep time on a triangle
in the class “orchestra” when I was a kid.
Songs and music don't stick in my head.
I might—might—recognize a piece, but I can't summon it up.
Most of all, I have a big hangup about singing.
When I was twelve, I was told that I shouldn't sing with the class
and I've hardly sung since.

My brother David is a professional actor
who has concentrated on singing in the last year.
I've meant to take singing lessons for some time.
If David can learn to sing, I can learn to croak.
