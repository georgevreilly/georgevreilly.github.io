I serve as tech support to my parents, Frank and Lyndol,
and a handful of others.
I was at Lyn's tonight to find out why he no longer had an Internet connection.
I told him when I arrived,
"This will take a minute or an hour."
Either it was going to be something that I'd spot in a moment
or I'd be fighting with it for a while.

I immediately noticed that the network hub was unpluggedâ€”\
and dared to hope that it might be just that simple.
It wasn't, of course:
the hub had been unplugged during Lyn's own fruitless troubleshooting.
I quickly pinpointed that the DSL modem was not connecting
and no amount of power-cycling would convince it otherwise.
His ISP's support line had closed down for the evening.
I left him with a few suggestions on what to tell them.
It occurs to me in retrospect that I didn't verify that
all cables were correctly plugged in,
but I think the real reason is that the modem is configured with Frank's user ID.
We transferred the billing to Lyn after Frank died.
It seems plausible that the DSL modem needs to be reconfigured with Lyn's credentials.
