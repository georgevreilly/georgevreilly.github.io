An `Irene Adler`_ book; earlier than `Spider Dance`_.

Suicidal sailors with ornate tattoos, an odd sealing wax, and lost treasure.
All these lead Irene, her husband Godfrey Norton, and Nell Huxleigh to Monte Carlo.
Irene, with a little help from Sarah Bernhardt and the Crown Prince's betrothed,
takes Monaco by storm.
Sherlock Holmes finds part of the trail, but completely misses the bigger case.

Fluff, but entertaining fluff.
