Wyatt is a meteorologist working with the U.S. Navy
on the small Caribbean island of San Fernandez.
He's convinced that Hurricane Mabel will change course and hit San Fernandez.
Trouble is, he can't convince the local dictator, Serrurier,
to evacuate the low-lying capital because the rebels have risen.

This is a fine early modern thriller by Bagley_.
Aside from the improbability of an insurrection
*and* a major hurricane happening simultaneously,
it's quite believable.
The tension mounts as the weather worsens,
people act in character, and no one has improbable talents.
Wyatt is naive and idealistic and
finds himself shocked by the *realpolitik* of the rebel leader, Favel.

Recommended.
