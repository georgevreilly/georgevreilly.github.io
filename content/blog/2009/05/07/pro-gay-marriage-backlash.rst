A month ago, `Vermont and Iowa`_ passed gay marriage laws.
Today, `Maine and New Hampshire`_ did the same.
The Maine Governor has already signed it into law.
The NH legislature passed a law, but it's possible their governor will veto it.

It's as if there were a pro-gay marriage backlash
after the anti-gay marriage `Proposition 8`_ passed in California last year.
Courts and legislatures are realizing the fundamental unfairness
of denying the benefits of marriage to all committed couples.
The sky didn't fall when Massachusetts legalized gay marriage five years ago.

There's no immediate prospect of a gay marriage law being enacted in Washington State.
Last month, the state legislature passed a law extending all of the state-given benefits
of being married to registered domestic partners.
There was some talk amongst the Religious Right
of a ballot initiative to repeal this DP benefits law,
but there seems to be `little appetite`_ for it.
40–45% of Washington state voters favor gay marriage,
while another 20–25% favor domestic partnerships.

In other news, today is the ninth anniversary of my wedding to Emma.
Our marriage doesn't feel at all threatened by events in New England.
