A paedophile chained up an eight-year-old boy's parents,
then took the boy and killed him.
DI Jack Caffery finds the case particularly stressful:
his brother was abducted and never found when they were boys.
His girlfriend is falling apart too.

Part thriller, part psychological study, part police procedural.
Hayder ratchets up the tension
as the internal and external pressures on Caffery grow.

Recommended.
