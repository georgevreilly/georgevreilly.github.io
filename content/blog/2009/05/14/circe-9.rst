We're rehearsing most Wednesdays for our reading of the
first half of the `Circe chapter of Ulysses`_ next month.
It's going well.
We need some more rehearsal, but it now sounds like we know what we're doing.
Tonight we read the entire piece through from beginning to end,
for the first time.
Now we know that it takes two-and-a-quarter hours.

We also got the poster tonight.
It looks great!
I'd post it, but I need to get the painting scanned first.
