We came up to Vancouver, BC for the weekend.
This morning, we visited the `Van Dusen Botanical Garden`_ for the first time.
In a relatively small area, they've put together many specialized gardens:
rhododendrons, a maze, heathers, redwoods, roses, gingkos, and more.
In Seattle terms, it has elements of the Arboretum_ and the
`Rhododendron Garden`_.
Well worth a visit, especially on a beautiful May morning.

This afternoon, we drove down to Ladner to visit
my great-uncle Dick and his wife Margaret.
They moved into a retirement home in March.
Dick has visibly failed since we last saw him in September.
Margaret remains remarkably spry and fit, but is nearly blind.

Tonight we are off to a party, the proximate excuse for our trip.
