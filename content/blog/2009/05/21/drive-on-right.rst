    :class: right-float

I initially learned to drive on the left in Ireland,
but have spent the last 20 years driving on the right in the States.
I personally never had any difficulty switching from one side to the other\
—except when extremely jetlagged—\
but I know several people who find it enormously stressful.
I find it easy enough to orient myself so that the lane divider is at the correct position.

When I was a kid, my father often brought his Irish car
over to mainland Europe on the car ferries.
A right-hand drive car driving on the right is doubly tricky.
It didn't seem to bother him too much, but I don't think my mother ever tried it.
I've never had the opportunity to try it myself.
