The California Supreme Court handed down their decision about Proposition 8 today:
they're letting it stand.
No new gay marriages, though the 18,000 same-sex marriages
that were enacted last year remain valid.

It's a setback to be sure.
The silver lining is that the gay community has been fired up
since Proposition 8 passed in November.

There's a small but real danger that `Referendum 71`_
will make it on to the ballot here in Washington state.
It would roll back the everything-but-marriage domestic partnership law
that passed recently.
