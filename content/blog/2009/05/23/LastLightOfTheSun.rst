*The Last Light of the Sun* takes place in the Dark Ages of a parallel world.
The Erlings (Vikings) raid the Cyngael (Welsh) and Anglcyn (Anglo-Saxon).
A young Erling flees indentured servitude and becomes a raider,
following in the footsteps of his estranged father.
A Cyngael prince dies in an Erling raid and is taken by the Queen of the Fairies;
his brother is drawn to another fairy;
he will enter into a reluctant compact with the Anglcyn when they are raided by the Erling.

Kay is an elegant and subtle writer.
The principal characters are well-drawn and complex,
struggling with their intersecting destinies.

Highly recommended.
