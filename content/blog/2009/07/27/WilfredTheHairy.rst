This may, perhaps, be old news in bear circles,
but I only read it ten days ago on the plane over,
in Robert Hughes' quirky `Barcelona the Great Enchantress`_.
The founder of Catalunyan/Catalonian/Catalan national independence
a thousand years' ago was the Visigoth known as `Wilfred the Hairy`_.
History does not record with any clarity how Guifré el Pilós earned that name.

I haven't visited the Iberian peninsula since the 1970s
when the well-founded stereotype was that Spanish men had mustaches.
That seems to have gone out of style:
almost all men, young or old, were cleanshaven.
And after having seen countless women wearing tanktops in the heat,
I can say that the stereotype about unshaven armpits is equally dated.

The enervating heat aside (high 30Cs = high 90Fs), Barcelona, the Pyrenees,
and Figueres (Dali's hometown) were all most enjoyable.
