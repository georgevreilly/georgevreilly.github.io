We're traveling to Spain and Ireland for three weeks.
I'm bringing the `netbook`_, not the 17" MacBook Pro, because it's small and light.
It doesn't have a DVD player and I'd like to bring some DVDs to watch.
I could either spend about $80 on an external DVD player,
or I could rip the DVDs beforehand.

I've ripped a few DVDs with `Handbrake`_,
an open source, cross-platform video transcoder,
which seems to do a good job.
I'm playing them in the cross-platform `VLC`_ player,
which released version 1.0.0 yesterday, after almost 8 years of development.
