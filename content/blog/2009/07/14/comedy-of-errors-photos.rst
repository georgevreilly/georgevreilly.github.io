I mentioned three weeks ago that I was putting together a group of people
to see `Greenstage`_'s production of Shakespeare's `Comedy of Errors`_
at the Seward Park Amphitheater.
Six of us braved the rain last night,
ate our picnic, and enjoyed an hour and a half of ribald slapstick.

Almost all of the cast cross-dressed.
The main male parts, the two sets of identical twin brothers, were played by women,
The wife, her sister, and the courtesan were played by ugly men
in the best `panto dame`_ tradition.

The play, like so many of Shakespeare's comedies,
requires an endless series of confused identities,
which could be cleared up in moments
if only someone paused and said, “Wait a minute!”

Much running around, no subtlety, fun.

Lots of photos at Flickr_.

`Seattle Shakespeare`_ are also putting on free, outdoor productions
of Shakespearean plays, *Taming of the Shrew* and *Richard III*.
Both end on August 2nd, before we get back from Europe.
Cathy saw their white trash production *Taming* yesterday
and raved about it today.
