We're off to Spain and Ireland tomorrow evening,
so lots of last-minute preparations tonight.
I laid out my clothes on the spare bed on Sunday;
Emma picked out hers this evening.
I've just paid some bills and I'm transferring files onto the netbook that I'm bringing.

I still have to whittle down the large pile of books that are under consideration.
I don't want to run out before we get to Ireland,
but I don't want to take too many.
Depending on what else is going on,
I'll get through a book in a day or two when I'm on vacation.
Maybe two books on those long plane flights.
