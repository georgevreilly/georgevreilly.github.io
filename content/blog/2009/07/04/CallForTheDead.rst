Le Carré's very first novel,
*Call for the Dead* introduces his most famous character, George Smiley.
After a harmonious meeting with Smiley to review his security clearance,
Samuel Fennan goes home, writes a letter complaining of harrassment,
and commits suicide.
But little things don't add up and Smiley starts investigating,
only to be nearly murdered himself.

A strong debut, and amazingly short at 160 pages.
*Call* provides some background about Smiley's very bad war,
undercover in Nazi territories, and his rocky marriage.
