Charlie Parker, the hero of John Connolly's books,
has always been able to rely on his friends,
the former assassin Louis and his life-partner Angel,
for backup when events turn bloody—\
most recently in `The Unquiet`_.

Louis' past is catching up with him, leading to a bloody climax.
As we explore that past,
we learn how a gay, black teenager in a `sundown town`_
was recruited to be a “reaper”.
When Louis and Angel are set up,
Parker and other friends must go in after them.

Partly an exploration of the different ways that the act of killing can affect people,
partly a thriller,
generally satisfying.
