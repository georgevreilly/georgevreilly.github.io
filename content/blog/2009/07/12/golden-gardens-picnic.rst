Two picnics this weekend.

Today we held the tenth annual `BiNet Seattle`_ picnic for the bisexual community,
which I once again organized, with some help from Emma.
Almost all of the preceding ones were held at Ravenna Park.
Even though I booked the picnic back in March,
Ravenna Park was unavailable this weekend,
which was the only weekend that really suited me.
We went to Golden Gardens Beach instead.
It's a nice park, but parking is atrocious on a busy weekend,
which may explain the poor turnout.
There were only 10 people, down from 20â€“30 for the last few years.
Three new faces; the rest were regulars.
As usual, Emma and I brought the meat, charcoal, plates, and tools,
and did the cooking.

Tomorrow's picnic will be before the open-air production of
`Comedy of Errors`_ at the Seward Park Amphitheater.
This one's easy: no-one's cooking.
We're just bringing food that's ready to eat.
