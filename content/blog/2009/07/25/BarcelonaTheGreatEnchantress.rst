Robert Hughes has been in love with Barcelona and its people for four decades.
This book—part selective history, part memoir—\
is adapted from a much larger, earlier book about Barcelona.
Hughes is a partisan of Catalan culture and food.
He brings us from its Roman origins as Barcino,
Catalunya's founding as an independent nation a thousand years ago
by the Visigoth `Wilfred the Hairy`_,
up through the Olympics in 1992.
This is no comprehensive survey:
he spends more time on submarine inventor `Monturiol`_
than on the Spanish Civil War.

Well-written and opinionated, if overly selective.
