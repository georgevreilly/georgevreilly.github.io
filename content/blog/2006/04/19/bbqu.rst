One of my favorite shows is back on the TiVo.
`Barbecue University <http://www.bbqu.net/>`_ is
Steven Raichlen's show about all kinds of
grilling and barbecue techniques and recipes.

I *love* this recipe for
`Afghan Game Hens
<http://www.recipecircus.com/recipes/Magnolias/BBQ/Afghan-Style_Game_Hens.html>`_,
although I always substitute chicken(s) for the game hens.
This recipe convinced me to buy a rotisserie.
It's been a huge hit whenever I've served it up.
It's not the easiest meal to prepare, so I don't do it often.
Note: I cook the marinaded onions in a pan and serve them with the chicken.
Yum!

`Beer Can Chicken
<http://splendidtable.publicradio.org/recipes/main_beercan.shtml>`_,
on the other hand, is very easy.
It also works well in the oven.
Last year, I found a stand which holds the beer can;
it's far more stable than propping the chicken
just on the can and the leg tips.
