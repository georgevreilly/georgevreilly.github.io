It's no secret that Bush is appallingly vacuous and incoherent whenever he
has to answer a question that he hasn't been prepped for. Here are a few
excerpts from his recent `appearance at Johns Hopkins University
<http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/04/20060410-1.html>`_:

    **The Presidency Is No Place for a Smart person**

        We're a influential nation, and so, therefore, many problems come
        to the Oval Office. And you don't know what those problems are
        going to be, which then argues for having smart people around.
        That's why you ought to serve in government if you're not going to
        be the President. You have a chance to influence policy by giving
        good recommendations to the President.

    **Return of Complete, Blithering Nonsense**

        I appreciate that very much. I wasn't kidding -- I was going to --
        I pick up the phone and say, Mr. Secretary, I've got an interesting
        question. This is what delegation -- I don't mean to be dodging the
        question, although it's kind of convenient in this case, but never
        -- I really will -- I'm going to call the Secretary and say you
        brought up a very valid question, and what are we doing about it?
        That's how I work. I'm -- thanks.

    **What's An "Integral"?**

        Economic development provides hope. And so, you bet. It's an
        integral of our policy.

    **Too Many Talking Points For One Tiny Brain**

        I think we need to be -- understand that we're a nation of
        immigrants, that we ought to be compassionate about this debate and
        provide a -- obviously, we've got to secure the border and enforce
        the law.

Wouldn't it be nice if we had a president who could speak in coherent
sentences.
