I'm a lot happier in my U.S. congressman, Jim McDermott, than I am in my
senators, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell. (Especially Cantwell.)

Jim has been a strong progressive voice in Congress for years.
His early opposition to the Iraq War led to him being dubbed 'Baghdad Jim'
by infuriated Republicans. He was one of the first national politicians
to support Howard Dean's bid for the presidency. He had a big role in
Fahrenheit 9/11. And he reads the role of Leopold Bloom for the 
`Wild Geese Players of Seattle's readings of *Ulysses*

For a decade, Jim has been fighting a legal battle for freedom of speech.
Recently, the appeals court ruled against him, leaving him with a $700,000
legal bill.

`theatrical benefit for Jim McDermott
