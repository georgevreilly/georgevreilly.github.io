In `The Media's Chance at Redemption
<http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2006/04/06/the_medias_chance_at_redemption.php>`_,
Russ Baker ably takes the MSM to task:

    When, oh when, will the U.S. “mainstream media” finally stop hemming and
    hawing, parsing and understating? When will they simply go for the jugular
    to confirm what any thoughtful American has already learned from “less
    reputable” but increasingly relevant alternative information sources: that
    from the beginning of the Bush administration, invading Iraq has always
    been as much an article of faith for the president as, well, promoting
    faith over reason?

    ...\-

    The *Times* report was full of throat-clearing and arcane notations that,
    while the memo had previously been reported, it had never been as fully
    reported, or that a particular passage had thus far eluded widespread
    scrutiny. And, indeed, the article did contribute new insights. But a
    careful reading of the *Times* piece turns up numerous opportunities
    where reporters could have offered—and, more importantly, still can
    offer—more context and thereby lead readers to the dark heart of the
    matter. To wit, the *Times* could not quite summon the courage for a
    sufficiently bold lead. It began:

        In the weeks before the United States-led invasion of Iraq, as the
        United States and Britain pressed for a second United Nations
        resolution condemning Iraq, President Bush's public ultimatum to
        Saddam Hussein was blunt: Disarm or face war.

        But behind closed doors, the president was certain that war was
        inevitable.

    Even though the overall thrust of the article was that Bush and Blair
    were hell-bent on invading Iraq, with or without justification, there
    was that second sentence summarizing, blandly, that “the president was
    certain that war was inevitable.” This is soft-pedaling in the extreme.
    Bush wasn’t certain war was inevitable—he wanted to make it inevitable.

    The article certainly makes that clear, describing all manner of
    shockers—from Bush musing about painting a U.S. reconnaissance plane in
    U.N. colors and deliberately drawing Iraqi fire as a *casus belli*, to
    the possibility of bringing out an Iraqi defector who would assert that
    WMDs existed even while Bush tacitly admitted they likely did not.

    This pussyfooting, the burying of the lead, does a disservice to
    readers. News organizations like the *Times* abetted the march to war
    through their unquestioning acceptance of highly debatable
    administration assertions, and, in the specific case of the *Times*, its
    tolerance of the rampaging cowboy reportage of its correspondent Judith
    Miller.

    ...\-

    Looking backward, virtually everyone now agrees that the media did not ask
    the right questions, or enough questions, as the war drums telegraphed
    impending conflict. Well, that was then. But now, major mysteries still beg
    for resolution: including, most fundamentally, how George W. Bush convinced
    the bulk of his fellow Americans, including some of the brightest lights of
    our society, to support such an ill-conceived war.

    Any journalist with a nose for news ought to be all fired up these days.
    It’s rare that we hacks are offered so many chances to show what we are
    made of—or to make up for errors of omission and commission that will
    otherwise haunt us in perpetuity.
