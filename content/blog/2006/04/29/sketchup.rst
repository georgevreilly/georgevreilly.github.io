I've just spent an hour working through the tutorials for
`Google SketchUp <http://sketchup.google.com/>`_.
It's a free 3D\-modeling tool. Pretty slick and easy to use.

I worked on `3D graphics and user interaction
<http://graphics.cs.brown.edu/>`_ when I was a Master's student
at Brown in the early 90s. What we had then wasn't bad,
but the SketchUp UI is easier to use and more functional,
and it runs on a regular PC instead of a high-end Unix workstation.

I can see myself using SketchUp to model woodworking projects.
