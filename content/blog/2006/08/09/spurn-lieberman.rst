Joe Lieberman, the 2000 vice-presidential nominee, lost the Democratic primary
for his Senate seat tonight. He has said that he will run as an independent.
In effect, he will not accept the will of the people.

Lieberman lost, in part, because of his continuing refusal to admit that
the Iraq war is a disaster, and in part because he has been a leading
enabler of the Republican agenda. Good riddance!

suggests contacting your senators and demand that they come out in support of
Lamont and that they strip Lieberman of his Senate committees.

I sent the following email to Senators Murray, Cantwell, and Reid:

    Ned Lamont won the Democratic primary in Connecticut. I urge you to express
    your support for him publicly. He is a good man and he will make a good
    Senator.

    Joe Lieberman has declared that his ego is more important than the
    Democratic party. You must repudiate him. You must strip him of all his
    Senate committee seats. You must shun him like a pariah.

    If Lieberman runs as an independent all the way to November, he will be the
    big political story, not the failure of the Republican leadership, not the
    need for change.
