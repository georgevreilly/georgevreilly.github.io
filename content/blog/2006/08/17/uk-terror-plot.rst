Craig Murray, the former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, who was fired
for speaking out about Karimov's use of torture, 
`writes about the UK terror plot
<http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/archives/2006/08/the_uk_terror_p.html>`_:

    I have been reading very carefully through all the Sunday newspapers to
    try and analyse the truth from all the scores of pages claiming to
    detail the so-called bomb plot. Unlike the great herd of so-called
    security experts doing the media analysis, I have the advantage of
    having had the very highest security clearances myself, having done a
    huge amount of professional intelligence analysis, and having been
    inside the spin machine....

    None of the alleged terrorists had made a bomb. None had bought a plane
    ticket. Many did not even have passports, which given the efficiency of
    the UK Passport Agency would mean they couldn't be a plane bomber for
    quite some time.

    In the absence of bombs and airline tickets, and in many cases
    passports, it could be pretty difficult to convince a jury beyond
    reasonable doubt that individuals intended to go through with suicide
    bombings, whatever rash stuff they may have bragged in internet chat
    rooms....

    In all of this, the one thing of which I am certain is that the timing
    is deeply political. This is more propaganda than plot. Of the over one
    thousand British Muslims arrested under anti-terrorist legislation,
    only twelve per cent are ever charged with anything. That is simply
    harrassment of Muslims on an appalling scale. Of those charged, 80% are
    acquitted. Most of the very few - just over two per cent of arrests -
    who are convicted, are not convicted of anything to do terrorism, but
    of some minor offence the Police happened upon while trawling through
    the wreck of the lives they had shattered.

    Be sceptical. Be very, very sceptical.
