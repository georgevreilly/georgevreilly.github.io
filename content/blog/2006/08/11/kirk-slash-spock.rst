Via Peter, a site full of `"inspirational" posters drawn from Star Trek
<http://echosphere.net/star_trek_insp/star_trek_insp.html>`_
in the vein of the satirical ones at `Despair.com <http://www.despair.com/>`_.

This poster of course plays on the trope of
`Kirk/Spock <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk/Spock>`_ fan fiction,
where Kirk and Spock are portrayed as lovers.
Emma has long been a fan of `slash
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction>`_, particularly pairings such
as Solo/Kuryakin (Man from U.N.C.L.E.) and Jack O'Neill/Daniel Jackson
(Stargate SG-1).
