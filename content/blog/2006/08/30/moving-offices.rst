In mid-July, most of the
`Atlas Solutions <http://www.WorkForAtlas.com>`_
developer teams moved from
our old offices at Fifth and Jackson in the International District
four blocks west to swanky offices in Pioneer Square.
The new offices are at the State building on the corner of
Occidental and Main, the pedestrianized block
with the antique stores and art galleries.
Occidental Park across the street has been refurbished.
There are three coffee shops within two blocks,
and `Elliott Bay Books <http://www.elliottbaybook.com/>`_
is one block west of us.
It's all very pleasant, with the exception of the large
number of homeless people.

The only thing that I miss from the old offices is that we're
further from the large number of Asian restaurants in the International
District.

I move back to 5&J the week after next. Two developers from my team, Atlas
OnDemand, are being loaned to another team for a few months.

The picture of me on a milk carton arises from the email exchange after the
loan was announced. Our boss said that he would post pictures of the two of
us so that the OnDemand team wouldn't forget what we look like. I demanded
to see my picture on a milk carton and, lo, that was arranged forthwith.
