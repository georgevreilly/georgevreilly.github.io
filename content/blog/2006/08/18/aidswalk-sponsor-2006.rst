This year is the 20th anniversary of the Northwest AIDS Walk.
A whole generation has passed.
Twenty years ago, AIDS was considered a gay man's disease and a death sentence.
The U.S. government was just beginning to acknowledge the existence of AIDS,
half a decade after it had first been recognized by health authorities, 
and thousands had died.

AIDS is still a serious problem, 
but the development of antiretroviral drugs a decade ago 
means that people with HIV are living longer, 
healthier lives than before. 
More than 1 million Americans are now living with HIV/AIDS: 
9,000 of them in King County. 
40,000 people are infected every year in the U.S., 
and most new infections are among African-Americans. 
The U.S. is getting off relatively lightly: 
about one-fifth of the adults in southern Africa have HIV! 
Nearly 40 milllion people are living with HIV around the world, 
and another 25 million are dead.

The Lifelong AIDS Alliance provides a variety of services 
to those living with HIV/AIDS in Washington State. 
I've walked in the AIDS Walk every year since 1992 
and I've raised thousands of dollars for AIDS services and awareness.

Please help me meet my fundraising goal of $1000 this year 
by sponsoring me at my AIDS Walk page. 
I will be walking on September 9th.

I thank you, the Lifelong AIDS Alliance thanks you, and the people you help thank you.
