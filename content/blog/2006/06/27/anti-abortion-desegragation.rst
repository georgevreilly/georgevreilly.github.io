I found an interesting
`piece <http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5502785>`_
on the NPR website about the modern anti-abortion movement:

    In the 1980s, in order to solidify their shift from divorce to
    abortion, the Religious Right constructed an *abortion myth*, one
    accepted by most Americans as true. Simply put, the abortion myth is
    this: Leaders of the Religious Right would have us believe that their
    movement began in direct response to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973
    *Roe v. Wade* decision. Politically conservative evangelical leaders were so
    morally outraged by the ruling that they instantly shed their
    apolitical stupor in order to mobilize politically in defense of the
    sanctity of life. Most of these leaders did so reluctantly and at great
    personal sacrifice, risking the obloquy of their congregants and the
    contempt of liberals and "secular humanists," who were trying their
    best to ruin America. But these selfless, courageous leaders of the
    Religious Right, inspired by the opponents of slavery in the nineteenth
    century, trudged dutifully into battle in order to defend those
    innocent unborn children, newly endangered by the Supreme Court's
    misguided *Roe* decision.

    It's a compelling story, no question about it. Except for one thing: It
    isn't true.

    ...\-

    Let's remember, [Paul Weyrich] said animatedly, that the Religious
    Right did not come together in response to the *Roe* decision. No,
    Weyrich insisted, what got us going as a political movement was the
    attempt on the part of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to rescind
    the tax-exempt status of Bob Jones University because of its racially
    discriminatory policies.

    ...\-

    "What caused the movement to surface," Weyrich reiterated,"was the
    federal government's moves against Christian schools." The IRS threat
    against segregated schools, he said, "enraged the Christian community."
    That, not abortion, according to Weyrich, was what galvanized
    politically conservative evangelicals into the Religious Right and
    goaded them into action. "It was not the other things," he said.
