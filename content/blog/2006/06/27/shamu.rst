I read a piece in yesterday's New York Times about some useful
`lessons learned from animal trainers
<http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/fashion/25love.html?ex=1308888000&en=f3a9c33e07612db0&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss>`_.

    So, like many wives before me, I ignored a library of advice books and
    set about improving him. By nagging, of course, which only made his
    behavior worse: he'd drive faster instead of slower; shave less
    frequently, not more; and leave his reeking bike garb on the bedroom
    floor longer than ever.

    ...\-

    I listened, rapt, as professional trainers explained how they taught
    dolphins to flip and elephants to paint. Eventually it hit me that the
    same techniques might work on that stubborn but lovable species, the
    American husband.

    The central lesson I learned from exotic animal trainers is that I
    should reward behavior I like and ignore behavior I don't. After all,
    you don't get a sea lion to balance a ball on the end of its nose by
    nagging. The same goes for the American husband.

    Back in Maine, I began thanking Scott if he threw one dirty shirt into
    the hamper. If he threw in two, I'd kiss him. Meanwhile, I would step
    over any soiled clothes on the floor without one sharp word, though I
    did sometimes kick them under the bed. But as he basked in my
    appreciation, the piles became smaller. 

    I was using what trainers call "approximations," rewarding the small
    steps toward learning a whole new behavior. You can't expect a baboon
    to learn to flip on command in one session, just as you can't expect an
    American husband to begin regularly picking up his dirty socks by
    praising him once for picking up a single sock. With the baboon you
    first reward a hop, then a bigger hop, then an even bigger hop. With
    Scott the husband, I began to praise every small act every time: if he
    drove just a mile an hour slower, tossed one pair of shorts into the
    hamper, or was on time for anything.

    ...\-

    On a field trip with the students, I listened to a professional trainer
    describe how he had taught African crested cranes to stop landing on
    his head and shoulders. He did this by training the leggy birds to land
    on mats on the ground. This, he explained, is what is called an
    "incompatible behavior," a simple but brilliant concept.

    Rather than teach the cranes to stop landing on him, the trainer taught
    the birds something else, a behavior that would make the undesirable
    behavior impossible. The birds couldn't alight on the mats and his head
    simultaneously.

    At home, I came up with incompatible behaviors for Scott to keep him
    from crowding me while I cooked. To lure him away from the stove, I
    piled up parsley for him to chop or cheese for him to grate at the
    other end of the kitchen island. Or I'd set out a bowl of chips and
    salsa across the room. Soon I'd done it: no more Scott hovering around
    me while I cooked.

    I followed the students to SeaWorld San Diego, where a dolphin trainer
    introduced me to least reinforcing syndrome (L. R. S.). When a dolphin
    does something wrong, the trainer doesn't respond in any way. He stands
    still for a few beats, careful not to look at the dolphin, and then
    returns to work. The idea is that any response, positive or negative,
    fuels a behavior. If a behavior provokes no response, it typically dies
    away. 

    ...\-

    I adopted the trainers' motto: "It's never the animal's fault." When my
    training attempts failed, I didn't blame Scott. Rather, I brainstormed
    new strategies, thought up more incompatible behaviors and used smaller
    approximations. I dissected my own behavior, considered how my actions
    might inadvertently fuel his. I also accepted that some behaviors were
    too entrenched, too instinctive to train away. You can't stop a badger
    from digging, and you can't stop my husband from losing his wallet and
    keys.

Hmmm...
