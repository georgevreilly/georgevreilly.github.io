In May, I pounded out a record 31 blog posts. June draws to a close and
this is only my third post.

In brief, here's some of the highlights of June.

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle `read the Cyclops chapter of Ulysses
<http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2006.html>`_ on June 16th.
I read a part and I was also the script wrangler and webmaster.

My profile on my Windows XP laptop got corrupted. I decided that I would
make flatten it and turn it into a dual-boot system. I'm now on my third
week of running Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake). Quite easy to get going. Not so
easy to get everything that I wanted running on it.

In late May at WinHEC, Microsoft announced
`FlexGo <http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/flexgo/default.mspx>`_,
the new pay-as-you-go and subscription versions of Windows.
I spent a year working on this project, specifically on the hardware
locking that underlies the business model. I swear I will write a more
interesting post on this soon.

This weekend was `Gay Pride <http://www.seattlepride.org/index2.htm>`_,
which was held for the first time at the Seattle Center.
I helped staff the `Freely Speaking Toastmasters
<http://www.toastmasterspride.org/>`_ booth yesterday morning.

As one of my commitments when I stepped down as president of
`BiNet Seattle <http://www.binetseattle.org/>`_
I made up a new banner, which we marched behind 
in the `Raise Your Voice march
<http://www.seattlelgbt.org/march2006.html>`_ yesterday evening.

My woodworking class has finished, so my Tuesday nights are free for the
summer. I'm making a coffee table. It's about half finished. I've taken a
few photos along the way; I'll have to post some of them.
