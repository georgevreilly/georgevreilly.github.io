AmericaBlog `links to a CNN segment
<http://americablog.blogspot.com/2006/05/must-watch-cnn-segment-on-quacks-who.html>`_
on the quacks who claim they can "cure" homosexuality.

Very creepy. Very bogus. And typical of so-called
`reparative therapy <http://www.pflag.org/Reparative_Therapy.exgay.0.html>`_.

I believe that those "ex-gays" who do manage to make a go of it are
bisexual rather than gay. In other words, they're no more than\-5 on the
`Kinsey scale <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale>`_.
