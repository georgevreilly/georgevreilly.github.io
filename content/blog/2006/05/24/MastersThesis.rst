`Raven <http://ravensara.blogspot.com/>`_ emailed me a link
to this story in the Onion:
`Heroic Computer Dies to Save World From Master's Thesis
<http://www.theonion.com/content/node/48461>`_:

    "This fearless little machine saved me from unspoken hours of exasperated
    head-scratching and eyestrain, as well as years of agonizing self-doubt
    over my decision to devote my life to teaching," said professor John
    Rebson, who had already read through three drafts of Samoskevich's
    sprawling, 38,000-word dissertation, titled A Hermeneutical Exploration Of
    Onomatopoeia In The Works Of William Carlos Williams As It May Or May Not
    Relate To Post-Agrarian Appalachia. "It was an incredible act of bravery.
    This laptop sacrificed itself in order to put an end to Jill's senseless
    rambling."

Nothing like my own Master's Thesis, *3-D Text Objects in the Brown
Animation Graphics System*, which clocked in at just 8\-pages.
Mind you, it was backed up by tens of thousands of lines of C\-code.
