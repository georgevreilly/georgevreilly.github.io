Nearly two years ago, I said that I was back at Microsoft,
`as a contractor
<http://weblogs.asp.net/george_v_reilly/archive/2004/09/26/234349.aspx>`_.
A year later, I said that I was moving on, because my `12 months were up
</blog/2005/09/18/JobHunting.html>`_.
In both cases, I said that I was doing some really interesting work and
that I hoped to be able to talk about it some day.

Now the truth can be told: I was working on
`FlexGo <http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/flexgo/default.mspx>`_,
Microsoft's new prepaid/subscription versions of Windows.
FlexGo was `announced last Monday
<http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/may06/05-21EmergingMarketConsumersPR.mspx>`_
and `unveiled the next day at WinHEC
<http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/2006/05-23WinHEC.asp>`_
(transcript of BillG's speech; FlexGo is at the end).
The `Seattle P-I article
<http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/271040_msftflex22.html>`_
has a good overview.

My former colleague, Gokul Thirumalai, has several posts up at his blog:
`initial announcement <http://www.gocool.org/?p=658>`_,
`WinHEC <http://www.gocool.org/?p=659>`_, and
`WinHEC video <http://www.gocool.org/?p=660>`_.

There was some speculation a few months ago about
`a secret hardware project between Microsoft and Transmeta
<http://www.hunterstrat.com/news/2006/03/20/microsofts-other-secret-hardware-project/>`_.
The speculation was pretty wild, but the real project was the secure
hardware platform that Transmeta put together for FlexGo:
`Mystery deal is high-security chip for 'FlexGo'
<http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/271014_software22.html>`_.
Someone has taken some
`pictures <http://www.aeroxp.org/board/index.php?showtopic=3732>`_
of the Transmeta system at WinHEC.

`Technology Pundits Analysis
<http://www.technologypundits.com/index.php?article_id=310&print=1>`_:

    What makes FlexGo key to the success of this program is the timing
    based software and security that is built into one of these low cost
    PC’s. FlexGo lets the Telco or Cable companies providing the PC manage
    the minutes used via prepaid cards tied directly to the PC’s abilities.
    Let’s say that a person buys a 60 minute prepaid card. The Internet
    connection to the system will work for 60 minutes and then it is shut
    off completely until the person buys more minutes. Of course, the PC
    itself is not disabled so they could do normal off line work. However,
    the system is designed so that the Cable or Telco can even shut down
    and disable the system via a locked down mode if someone tries to hack
    it or abuses it.

    This is especially true of the special system Microsoft and Transmeta
    created. Two years ago, Microsoft paid Transmeta $10 million to help
    them develop what turns out to be a truly secure system in which the
    cable or telecom provider has control of the system and it is virtually
    hack proof. AMD uses the Secure BIOS from Phoenix in their offerings
    but it does not work the same way the Microsoft/Transmeta system does.
    That is because Transmeta created specific enhancements to their 1.1
    GHz effecion processor and tied their secure layer to CMS and not to
    the BIOS itself. This co-development work was critical to Microsoft’s
    thinking about the project; in fact, they own this special system and
    design which has to be licensed directly from Microsoft along with the
    special XP Home edition and Transmeta just gets a royalty on every
    processor sold.

Fundamental Theorem of Software Engineering:
*Any problem can be solved with an extra level of indirection*.
