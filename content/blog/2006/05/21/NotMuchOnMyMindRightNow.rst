    :alt: Blog Spam makes the Baby Jesus cry
    :class: right-float

I have two blogs,
`my personal blog </blog/>`_
and
`my technical blog <http://weblogs.asp.net/george_v_reilly/>`_.
The technical blog is a small subset of the personal blog containing posts
that are more likely to be of interest to the techie audience at
`weblogs.asp.net <http://weblogs.asp.net/>`_.

Lately, the comments in `one post
<http://weblogs.asp.net/george_v_reilly/archive/2006/04/08/442310.aspx#FeedBack>`_
at weblogs.asp.net have been repeatedly spammed with sad little gems like the
following:

* `"not much on my mind right now"
  <http://www.google.com/search?q=%22not+much+on+my+mind+right+now%22>`_

* `"I just don't have anything to say , but shrug"
  <http://www.google.com/search?q=%22I+just+don%27t+have+anything+to+say+,+but+shrug%22>`_

* `"I've just been letting everything happen without me"
  <http://www.google.com/search?q=%22I%27ve+just+been+letting+everything+happen+without+me%22>`_

* `"Basically nothing noteworthy happening right now, but eh"
  <http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Basically+nothing+noteworthy+happening+right+now%2C+but+eh%22>`_

* `"My mind is like a void"
  <http://www.google.com/search?q=%22My+mind+is+like+a+void%22>`_

If you click the links above, you'll find that I'm not the only one who's
getting this treatment. The spams are clearly generated by a bot, which is
generating links to an enormous variety of randomly chosen sites, with no
obvious commonality.

Surprisingly, I can find very few discussions of this particular
phenomenon, save `Nihilist spam
<http://www.thetalentshow.org/archives/002445.html>`_
and `Best Comment Spam Ever
<http://turnipville.com/wordpress/2006/04/219>`_.
It seems to have been the catalyst triggering
`PocketNow: Requiring Registration [to Post]
<http://discuss.pocketnow.com/showthread.php?s=579658590495331568e9879149601237&postid=60972#post60972>`_.

My personal blog is running `dasBlog <http://dasblog.info/>`_, which has a
`CAPTCHA implementation
<http://www.hanselman.com/blog/APotentialCAPTCHACommentSpamSolutionForDasBlogAndOthersWithNoRecompileOrCodeChanges.aspx>`_,
as well as some other `anti-spam features
<http://dasblog.info/CategoryView,category,Features,V1.8.aspx>`_.
So far, I haven't had a spam problem there, but perhaps I'm just flying
under the spammers' radar.

`Brian Goldfarb <http://blogs.msdn.com/bgold/default.aspx>`_ recently sent
mail to all the bloggers at weblogs.asp.net, detailing forthcoming changes
and improvements (sorry, can't find a public post). There was no specific
mention of dealing with comment spam, alas.

I found the `SixApart Guide to Comment Spam
<http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/comment_spam>`_
to be useful, if wordy and Movable Type-centric.
They agree with Scott Mitchell on
`the Worth(lessness) of CAPTCHAs
<http://scottonwriting.net/sowblog/posts/3154.aspx>`_.
And this summary of the problem of
`Comment Spam <http://www.ilovejackdaniels.com/spam/stop-comment-spam/>`_
ain't bad.
