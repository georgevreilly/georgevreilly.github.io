I remember about two years ago, before a trip across the Atlantic, trying
to find websites that had street maps for London and Dublin -- and coming
up nearly empty.

Now, a year after it became available, I notice that Google Maps
covers `Ireland and the UK <http://maps.google.co.uk>`_.
Unfortunately, it does a piss-poor job of finding locations:
try typing anything more specific than *Dublin* into the search box.

Google Maps now provides a basic ability to get directions
`between cities

Some other map links:

* `Irish sightseeing <http://maps.frommars.org/ireland/>`_
* `Maps of Ireland and the UK <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maps_of_the_UK_and_Ireland>`_
* `Via Michelin
