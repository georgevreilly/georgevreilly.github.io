I first started blogging at
`EraBlog <http://erablog.net/blogs/george_v_reilly/>`_ in February 2003,
during the run-up to the Iraq war. EraBlog never really took off and now
seems to be experiencing technical problems.

I'm reposting all of my original posts. I've cleaned up the links, where
possible, and added an image at the top of each one, but have not otherwise
modified the posts.

As you can see, Iraq weighed on my mind. And I was fucking right!
Going to war was wrong, and even then I (like many others) could see that
the case for war was lacking.
