David Neiwert writes:

    | Go smugly amid the noise and haste,
    | and remember what peace there may be in stonewalling.
    | As far as possible, leave no chance of surrender
    | and be on superior terms to all other persons.
    | Speak your truthiness loudly and garbled;
    | and never listen to others,
    | especially not the wise and the well-informed;
    | they can all just go to hell.
