Today (May 6th) was our sixth wedding anniversary.
In some ways, it feels like only yesterday.
In others, it feels like we've been together forever.

Six pretty good years. Lots of good memories. Quiet times. Happy times.
Travel together. Staying home together. Going out together.
Mixing with our friends.

Not perfect years. I'd change a few things if I could, like Emma's health
and her two long periods of unemployment. I should have quit Microsoft
months before I did in 2004.

We celebrated by having some friends over for dinner.
`Raven <http://ravensara.blogspot.com/>`_ came with `Mr. Raven
<http://ravensara.blogspot.com/2006/04/worthy-cause-supporting-community.html>`_.
Muhsin and Banu, newly back from a long trip to Turkey, came too.
I made `Afghan Chicken
</blog/2006/04/19/BarbecueUniversity.html>`_.
It was a little dry this time, but it was still a big hit.
Emma `hurt her foot
<http://www.emmabart.com/Meanderings/WhereHaveYouBeen.aspx>`_ last week,
so I did all the cooking.

Tomorrow morning, we're going on the 
`Spirit of Washington Dinner Train
<http://www.spiritofwashingtondinnertrain.com/>`_
for brunch.
