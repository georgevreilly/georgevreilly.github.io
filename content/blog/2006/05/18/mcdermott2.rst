I `blogged </blog/2006/04/18/SupportJimMcDermott.html>`_
last month on Jim McDermott's long-running First Amendment legal battle
with John Boehner, the new Republican Majority Leader.
`The Stranger <http://www.thestranger.com/>`_ has a 
`cover story <http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=34045>`_
giving a lot of detail on the case.

`President Clinton
<http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002988658_clinton12m.html>`_
will be appearing at the Seattle Center on June\-3rd in a fundraiser for
McDermott.

*Update*: The
`We The People <http://www.McDermottforCongress.com/Tickets.aspx>`_
event will be held from 5:30-7:30pm at the Seattle Center Exhibition Hall.
Tickets can be ordered `here <http://www.McDermottforCongress.com/Tickets.aspx>`_.
I just ordered tickets for Emma and me. See you there.
