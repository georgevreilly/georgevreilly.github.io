My opera education continues. Tonight, we saw
`Seattle Opera's production of Verdi's MacBeth
<http://www.seattleopera.org/operas/2005-2006/macbeth/>`_.

I used to be very familiar with
`Shakespeare's MacBeth <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth>`_,
having studied it for two years in preparation for the
`Leaving Certificate <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_Certificate>`_
(the major examination at the end of Irish secondary school;
effectively the entrance exam for university).

Verdi's `opera of MacBeth <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth_%28opera%29>`_
truncates Shakespeare's plot, concentrating on the tragic flaw of the
MacBeths. Their shared ambition, feeding off each other, both impels them
to power, and leads to their ultimate downfall. The opera was written
during the `Risorgimento <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_unification>`_,
when Italy was trying to break away from the Austrian empire, and doubles
as a thinly veiled appeal to Italian patriotism.

I had more fun at
`Cosi Fan Tutte </blog/2006/03/09/CosiFanTutte.html>`_,
when we saw it in March. The music and singing was fine in MacBeth, but I
did not care for the monochromatic costumes and sets, which reminded me of
`Mourning Becomes Electra
<http://www.seattleopera.org/operas/2003-2004/mourning/index.aspx>`_.
The cast looked as if they had stepped out of a daguerrotype of a funeral.
There's no fun in Verdi's MacBeth. Shakespeare's tragedies are always
leavened by some comic doings, but not Verdi's.
