I saw a video clip of so-called
`Russian Climbing <http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2684760?htv=12>`_
at work today. It turns out that it's an extreme sport of French origin
called `Parkour <http://parkour.net/index.php?sel_lang=english>`_ or
`Free Running <http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/fundamentals/fundamentals.htm>`_.

Parkour is "the art of forward motion in spite of obstacles". Its
practitioners (traceurs) run around urban landscapes,
performing Jacky Chan-like leaps, rolls, stunts, jumps, and flips.

The excellent `HowStuffWorks.com <http://www.howstuffworks.com/>`_
has a good `introductory piece on Parkour
<http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/parkour.htm>`_.

There is a local group of traceurs, who are written up in a
`P-I article <http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/252602_parkour19.html>`_.
Their website is `Washington Parkour <http://washingtonparkour.com/>`_.
It seems there's a "jam" every Sunday at noon at Seattle's Freeway Park.
It sounds like a photo-op to me.
