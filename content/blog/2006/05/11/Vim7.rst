More than two years in the making, Vim\-7.0 is finally
`out <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vimannounce/message/161>`_!

(Vim is Vi IMproved, an enormously enhanced version of the classic Unix
editor, ``vi``.)

The main features of the 7.0 release are:

* Spell checking
* Omni-completion (Intellisense-like)
* Tabbed pages
* VimL script language now supports Lists and Dictionaries

I'm going to take credit for some minor features of Vim 7:

* Making Vim build with `VC5-VC8
  </blog/2006/01/22/CompilingVimWithVisualC2003Toolkit.html>`_
* The `Win64 port </blog/2006/04/22/Win64PortOfVim.html>`_
* Syntax highlighting for `FlexWiki

WikiPedia summarizes the `history of Vim
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29#History>`_.
This enabled me to pinpoint when I first became a contributor to Vim,
back in December 1995. I cleaned up the original, rather buggy
port of `Vim\-3.0 to NT
<http://groups.google.com/group/comp.editors/browse_thread/thread/a3fad9455d7a23cf/13c6939208787c22>`_,
and posted it to the `comp.editors <news://news.readfreenews.net/comp.editors>`_ newsgroup.
Bram invited me to merge my changes into Vim\-4.0, which was then under
development, and I became the `owner of Win32 Vim
</blog/2005/12/30/20YearsOfVi.html>`_
for the next couple of years.
