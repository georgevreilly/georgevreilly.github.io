Three years ago, one of our must-watch shows was
`Fire Within
<http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/OnScreen/TVShows/FireWithin.htm>`_,
a documentary on the making of Cirque du Soleil's *Varekai* show.
It followed a set of would-be performers in the eight months leading up to
the premiere of *Varekai*, as they train at the Cirque's school in
Montreal, developing potential acts. Some of them make it, some fall by the
wayside.

*Varekai* has been on tour ever since, and it just opened in `Seattle
<http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/varekai/TicketsGeneral/Seattle.htm>`_.
We saw it tonight.
Very little of the original show survives;
mostly, the aerial strap act with the twins, Kevin and Andrew.

I recommend it. *Varekai* is a visual spectacular,
with all the familiar elements of incredible acrobatics,
clown acts, and bizarre costumes.

Two young Chinese boys twirling pots on ropes;
hunky twin men on aerial swings;
a team of acrobats twirling each other on their feet;
a spotlight-loving sleazeball crooner;
acrobats hurtling off a giant swing;
and a human pretzel of a contortionist.
Quite the show.

Someday I have to post the photos that I took of the
`Zip\-Zap circus school
<http://www.zip-zap.co.za/V1/index.html>`_
performing at the Cavendish mall in Cape Town.
Some of the best free entertainment that I've ever come across.
