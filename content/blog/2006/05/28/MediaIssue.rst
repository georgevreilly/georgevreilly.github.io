<http://mediamatters.org/items/200605260016>`_:

    The defining issue of our time is not the Iraq war. It is not the
    "global war on terror." It is not our inability (or unwillingness) to
    ensure that all Americans have access to affordable health care. Nor is
    it immigration, outsourcing, or growing income inequity. It is not
    education, it is not global warming, and it is not Social Security.

    The defining issue of our time is the media.

    The dominant political force of our time is not Karl Rove or the
    Christian Right or Bill Clinton. It is not the ruthlessness or the
    tactical and strategic superiority of the Republicans, and it is not
    your favorite theory about what is wrong with the Democrats.

    The dominant political force of our time is the media.

    Time after time, the news media have covered progressives and
    conservatives in wildly different ways -- and, time after time, they do
    so to the benefit of conservatives.

    Consider the last two presidents. Bill Clinton faced near-constant
    media obsession with his "scandals," while George W. Bush has gotten
    off comparatively easy.

    ...\-

    At this point, you'd have to be blind to miss the pattern. Every
    prominent progressive leader who comes along is openly derided in the
    media as fake, dishonest, conniving, out-of-the-mainstream, and weak.
    We simply can't continue to chalk this up to shortcomings on the part
    of Democratic candidates or their staff and consultants. It's all too
    clear that this will happen regardless of who the candidate or leader
    is; regardless of who works for him or her. The smearing of Jack Murtha
    should prove that to anyone who still doubts it.

Look what happened to Al Gore in the run-up to the 2000 election versus how
George Bush was treated then by the media. Gore, the well-qualified
candidate, was subjected to an endless barrage of ridiculous stories
accusing him of everything from fraudulently claiming to have invented the
Internet, to being the inspiration for *Love Story*. Meanwhile, Bush was
making all kinds of nonsense claims for his tax cuts, and his insider
trading at Harken was being completely overlooked.
