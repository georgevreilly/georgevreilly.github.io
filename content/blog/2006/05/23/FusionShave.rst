I've been sporting a goatee for the last two months, instead of my usual
full beard. This has necessitated shaving, and I've been using those
disposable Bic razors. I haven't been very happy with them. They left my
face feeling like I had been making out with a cheese grater.

I bought one of those new five-bladed `Fusion razors
<http://www.gillettefusion.com/us/>`_ yesterday and shaved with it this
morning. Oh my! Very smooth!

I'm convinced that five blades is marketing hokum and that five blades is
probably not really better than four blades. Or three blades. But five
blades is certainly better than one.
