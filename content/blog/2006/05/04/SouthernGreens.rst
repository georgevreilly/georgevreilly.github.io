Some recipes from the back of a bag of Trader Joe's Southern Greens Blend
(Mustard Greens, Turnip Greens, Spinach, and Collard Greens).

**Simple Greens -- Serves 4**

==========  ========================================================
1 lb        Mustard Greens, Turnip Greens, Spinach, and Collard Greens
1 clove     garlic, minced
1 onion     chopped
1/2 cup     chopped green onions
2 Tbsp.     olive oil
1 cup       vegetable broth
1 cup       tomato juice
\-          Salt, pepper, and marjoram to taste
\-          Grated Parmesan cheese
==========  ========================================================

Saute garlic and onion in olive oil in a pot large enough to hold greens.
Add vegetable broth and tomato juice. Bring to a boil.

Add greens and seasonings. Cover and cook over low heat for 35 minutes
or until tender. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese and serve.


**Mediterranean Greens -- Serves 3-4**

==========  ========================================================
1 lb        Mustard Greens, Turnip Greens, Spinach, and Collard Greens
1/4 cup     sundried tomatoes, oil marinated & sliced
2 Tbsp.     minced fresh garlic
\-          Ground black pepper to taste
2 Tbsp.     toasted pine nuts
1/4 cup     black olives
1/4 cup     pimiento-stuffed olives
1/4 cup     kalamata olives, pitted & sliced
1/4 cup     olive oil
1 1/2 cups  roma tomatoes, cut into strips
1 cup       vegetable or chicken broth
==========  ========================================================

(Note: The original recipe called for half a cup of each of the three types
of olives, which we found overpowering. I've halved the quantities to
one-quarter cup each.)

Combine olives, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, olive oil,
and pepper in a large pre-heated skillet.
Cook over high heat for 6-8 minutes, until boiling.
Blend in roma tomatoes and heat 2 more minutes.
Add greens and broth and continue to cook for 25-30 more minutes.
Stir in pine nuts and salt to taste.
Serve at once as an accompaniment
or spoon over pasta and serve as a main course.


**Louisiana Style Greens & Sausage -- Serves 3-4**

==========  ========================================================
1 lb        Mustard Greens, Turnip Greens, Spinach, and Collard Greens
2 Tbsp.     olive oil
1 onion     diced coarsely
8 oz.       Papa Cantella's Smoked Chicken Andouille Sausage, sliced 1/4" thick
            (or other cooked sausage)
2 cups      chicken broth
\-          Salt and pepper to taste
==========  ========================================================

Over medium heat, cook onions in olive oil until soft in a 4 quart pot.
Add the sausages, greens, and chicken broth, stirring to blend all ingredients.
Simmer gently over low heat for about 35 minutes or until greens are tender.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.
