    :alt: New Ads Funded by Big Oil Portray Global Warming Science as Smear Campaign Against Carbon Dioxide

A front group for Big Oil is `putting out ads
<http://thinkprogress.org/2006/05/18/new-ads-funded-by-big-oil-portray-global-warming-science-as-smear-campaign-against-carbon-dioxide/>`_
denying the reality of global warming, in a pre-emptive bid
to undermine Al Gore's new documentary,
`An Inconvenient Truth <http://www.climatecrisis.net/>`_.

    The first ad portrays global warming science as a vicious smear campaign
    against carbon dioxide. The ad, which despite appearances is not an SNL
    parody, helpfully reminds us that carbon dioxide is “essential to life”
    because “we breath[e] it out.”

"An Inconvenient Truth" opens in Seattle on `June 2nd, 2006
