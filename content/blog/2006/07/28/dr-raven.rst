`Raven <http://ravensara.blogspot.com/>`_ is now *Doctor* Raven.
She successfully defended her doctoral dissertation in biomedical
informations this morning. Six long years in the making.

Dr. Raven and Mr. Raven came over this evening for Games Night,
a twice-monthly get-together we have for our friends to play board games.
Emma and I had been given a bottle of *Dom Perignon '92* for our wedding
that we had never quite found a suitable occasion for until now,
so we chilled that in anticipation of tonight's celebration.
I generally don't care for champagne, but that went down nicely.

Congratulations, Raven!
