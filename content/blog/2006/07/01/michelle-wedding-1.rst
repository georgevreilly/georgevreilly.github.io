I hadn't really planned to visit Ireland this year, but then my sister
Michelle phoned the other day to say that her boyfriend, David Bowles, had
just proposed to her. Not a big surprise. They had moved in together
earlier this year, and we were all assuming that it was a question of when,
not if.

They plan to get married quite soon, as his father has been given
six-to-nine months to live, and they want him to be at the wedding. I don't
know if the date is firm yet, but the latest that I'm hearing is November\-11th.
