I often complain about being busy, no doubt because I have a talent for
complicating my life. Things were relatively quiet for a while, but that's
not true anymore.

At work, we're close to releasing the first version of our product.
Happily, crunch time at Atlas isn't nearly as bad as it was at Microsoft.
Instead of working eight-ish hours a day, it's more like nine or maybe ten.
The pressure level has risen, of course, but it's far from intolerable.

The real busyness is in my extracurricular life. I'm the president of
`BiNet Seattle <http://www.BiNetSeattle.org>`_, a bisexual community group,
and have been for the last three years. I also do a hell of a lot of the
work and I'm burning out.
I recently gave notice that I'm stepping down. (It looks like a successor has been
found.) Meanwhile, a lot of planning is going on in an effort to revitalize
BiNet, as attendance has been dragging.

For the last few years, I've also been heavily involved with
`The Wild Geese Players of Seattle <http://www.WildGeeseSeattle.org>`_,
as the webmaster and the `co-dramaturge
</blog/2005/06/16/XMLScriptsForTheTheatre.html>`_.
We do readings of Irish literature, particularly that of
James Joyce and W.B.\-Yeats. Every June 16th (Bloomsday), we do a
`staged reading <http://www.WildGeeseSeattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/>`_
of a chapter of *Ulysses*. This year, the longtime director
has moved back to Northern Ireland. Currently, I am acting as the director,
on top of my other roles, but I don't think I'm the right person for the job,
and I'm hoping to find a replacement soon.

I'm a member of `Freely Speaking Toastmasters
<http://www.freelyspeaking.org/>`_, an LGBT speaking club.
I've been working on my
`CTM <http://www.freelyspeaking.org/speeches1.htm>`_ for far 
too long, and I intend to knock off the final three speeches this year.

I resume my woodworking class next week, which is going to tie up ten
Tuesday evenings. I haven't decided yet what I'm going to work on this
time. In previous years, I built a very nice set of nesting tables and
an unsatisfactory pair of bar stools.

In my Copious Spare Time, I'm also making occasional contributions
to two open source projects, `DasBlog <http://www.dasblog.info>`_
and `Vim <http://www.vim.org>`_.
I made Vim `compile with VC5-VC8
</blog/2006/01/22/CompilingVimWithVisualC2003Toolkit.html>`_,
and I promised Bram that I would provide some documentation on
debugging Vim with WinDbg and dealing with minidumps.
I'd also like to produce a native Win64 version.
With DasBlog, I've provided some
`feedback on the usability of the installation instructions
</blog/2006/02/10/UsabilityTestingDasBlogInstallation.html>`_,
as well as a fix for `dodgy permalinks
<https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=709018&aid=1357799&group_id=127624>`_.
I'd also like to make use of my former expertise on IIS performance
(see `25+ Tips <http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/server/asp/asptips.asp>`_,
`10 Commandments <http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/server/iis/tencom.asp>`_,
`IIS 5 Tuning <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/technologies/iis/maintain/optimize/iis5tune.mspx>`_,
and `Professional ASP 3.0 <https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1861002610/georgvreill-20>`_)
to do some performance tuning of DasBlog.

I'd also like to fit in some time for photography;
for reading my way through our enormous backlog of books and magazines;
writing the occasional blog post; cooking; bicycle riding;
traveling; working out; hanging out with my wife;
socializing with my friends; movies; and more.
Not to mention all the very dull projects around the house
and garden that I've neglected.
