A very interesting piece in last Sunday's New York Times magazine:
`A Talib at Yale <http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/magazine/26taliban.html>`_.
Sayed Rahmatullah Hashemi is the former "roving ambassador" for the
Taliban, now studying at Yale.
An interesting and improbable life story.

The right-wing blogosphere is furious about it. I say it's better to co-opt
moderate former Talibs than to freeze them out.

Besides, his B\-grades at Yale are better than George Bush's
"Gentleman's\-C".
