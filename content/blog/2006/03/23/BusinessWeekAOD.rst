The latest issue of `BusinessWeek <http://www.businessweek.com/>`_ covers
`Atlas On Demand <http://www.atlassolutions.com/news/releases/20050523>`_,
the product that I've worked on for the last six months, in a piece called
`TV Eyeballs Close-Up
<http://www.businessweek.com/@@nKnqf4YQDhFL8B0A/magazine/content/06_13/b3977404.htm>`_

    Ever since the advent of commercial television, advertisers have
    wondered exactly what they get for the megabucks they spend on
    30-second spots. After all, the networks and cable companies offer only
    a crude approximation of who is watching what. With such thin
    information, advertisers can't target specific neighborhoods or
    consumer tastes. As for converting ads directly to sales, well, that's
    virtually impossible. Yet the Web, with its sophisticated per-click
    metrics, does all of that billions of times a day. "The problem," says
    Yankee Group analyst Aditya Kishore, "is that there's not enough math
    in [the TV] business."

    But aQuantive Inc. (AQNT ) aims to change that. ...
    Despite the hoopla about advertisers moving online, the $70 billion
    television ad market dwarfs the Web business 5 to 1. Says aQuantive CEO
    Brian P. McAndrews, once an ABC executive: "TV is the largest medium
    out there."

    ...\-

    That's why aQuantive is taking baby steps. Starting in June, the
    company's Atlas on Demand unit will begin testing technology that
    measures video-on-demand (VOD) viewers for Charter Communications Inc.
    (CHTR ) VOD's Web-like interactivity is what sold aQuantive. Besides,
    the medium is taking off, with digital cable now in 25 million homes,
    far ahead of TiVo's 4.4 million.

    By gathering data from the same set-top boxes viewers use to order
    shows and movies, Atlas on Demand plans to figure out how many people
    watched a show and when, as well as how many watched the ads vs.
    skipped them. From there, company executives hope to help advertisers
    determine precisely how much attention their money buys. "You know
    people watch Lost," says John Chandler, Atlas on Demand senior analyst.
    "[Now] you'll know if they watch the ad."

    Proponents of VOD hope the medium will become as interactive as the Web
    itself, allowing viewers to get discount offers, enter contests, and
    even buy stuff. Burger King is considering running ads offering
    drive-through deals to late-night VOD viewers. Such ads could be priced
    based on the number of leads or sales they generate rather than the
    number of viewers they attract. "The intersection of video on demand
    and interactive TV is the next frontier," says Time Warner Cable (TWX )
    Executive Vice-President Peter C. Stern. "I look for it to emerge in
    2007."

    ...\-

    Despite myriad challenges, the cable guys have little choice but to
    become more Web-like. Every other day, it seems, marks the launch of
    yet another ad-supported online channel. Karl Siebrecht, Atlas' general
    manager, bets Web video will become a major ad market sooner than VOD,
    but he says on-demand TV eventually will be bigger. He and the other
    Atlas folks don't care whether the next great video market is TV or the
    Web. They plan to make money either way.
