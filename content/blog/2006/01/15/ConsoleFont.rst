I re-read Scott Hanselman's blog post on
`using Consolas as the Windows Console Font
<http://www.hanselman.com/blog/UsingConsolasAsTheWindowsConsoleFont.aspx>`_,
and I decided to put together a
`registry file </content/binary/console-font.reg.txt>`_
to make it a little simpler.
(You'll have to rename the file to ``console-font.reg`` after downloading.)

The registry file includes entries for:

* `Andale Mono <http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/>`_
* `DejaVu Sans Mono <http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/>`_
  (an extended version of `Bitstream Vera <http://gnome.org/fonts/>`_)
* `Consolas <http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=47&aid=78683>`_

As Scott says:
    *(I'm afraid I can't distribute Consolas online
    or provide a download out of abject fear.
    That said, you can find it in any version of the Longhorn bits.)*

Or Office 12, I believe.

**Update, 2008/01/15**.
The `Consolas Font Pack`_ is the easiest way to get Consolas,
if you don't have Office 2007 or Vista.
Technically, you are supposed to have Visual Studio 2005.
(I'm guessing that VS 2008 comes with Consolas.)
