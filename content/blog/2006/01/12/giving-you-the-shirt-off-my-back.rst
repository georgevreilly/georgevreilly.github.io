On Tuesday night, I felt like Imelda Marcos.
I conducted a long-overdue purge of my closet,
leaving me with two large boxes of clothes, mostly shirts and t-shirts.
I probably got rid of 80% of my collection of Microsoft shirts.
All in all, I had 63 empty hangars in the closet when I was done.
Yikes!

Lately, I've been dressing a little better.
More button-down shirts, fewer t-shirts.
Not that there's been any pressure to do so at work --
the geeks at Atlas are just as badly, er, informally dressed
as at any other software company that I've worked at.
