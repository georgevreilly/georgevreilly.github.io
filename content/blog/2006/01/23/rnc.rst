This application to join the Republican National Committee
arrived in the mail the other day.
Hell hasn't frozen over yet,
so I won't be joining the Republican party.

I don't know how the RNC came up with my name,
though I got another solicitation from them a few years ago.
Usually, I get solicitations from the Dems
and from a variety of progressive causes,
but then I have a track record of supporting them.

The previous owner of our house, Harry Korrell, is a Republican lawyer.
He was a member of `Dino Rossi's team

when Rossi was trying to overturn the last gubernatorial election
in Washington state. Feh!
