This morning, I sent the following letter to the Democratic
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee:

    Senator,

    Your job last week was to show up Samuel Alito as the extremist that he is.

    You failed. You were outmaneuvred by the Republicans and you did not make
    a compelling case when you had the spotlight on you. Instead many of you
    were, rightfully, pilloried as bloviating blowhards.

    Do you really want your legacy to be that you swung the Supreme Court
    to the right for three decades? Do you want to remembered as one who
    lost Roe v. Wade? That you placed someone with a track record of
    privileging the executive branch on the Court under such an administration?
    To have confirmed, by default, another Justice in the mold of Scalia
    and Thomas?

    Stand up and fight! If -- no, when! -- Alito gets out of committee, 
    filibuster!
    What are you saving the filibuster for, if not to prevent the balance
    of power changing in the Supreme Court?

    We, the freedom lovers of America, are counting on you to do your job, and 
    lead!

    George V. Reilly,
    Seattle, WA
