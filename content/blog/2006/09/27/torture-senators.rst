I just sent the following letter to my senators,
`Patty Murray <http://murray.senate.gov/contact/contact.cfm>`_ and
`Maria Cantwell <http://cantwell.senate.gov/contact/>`_,
as well as to the
`Seattle Post-Intelligencer's Letter Page 
<http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/letters.asp>`_:

    How has America come to this? Is the United States of America truly 
    about to repudiate the Geneva Convention? Is the Senate about to let 
    the President decide when and whom to torture?

    This is foul. This is wholly un-American. This is deeply immoral.
    Every civilized society abhors torture.
    
    How can we claim to be spreading Democracy in the Middle East at the 
    same time that we commit torture? Are we to lose *all* of our moral 
    standing in the eyes of the world under this wretched Administration?

    Tell me that we're better than this. Please!

    Senator, you *must* oppose this wholeheartedly. Do *not* let it come to 
    a vote on the floor of the Senate.
