In the past few weeks, I've received not one but two letters from
Christine Gregoire, the governor of Washington State, looking for support in
re-electing her. The thing is, is that she's running in 2008, not 2006.

I threw away the first one. On the second one, I wrote something like this
and mailed it back:

    If this had come in December, I have been willing to support you.
    But not six weeks from a high-stakes election. What the *hell* are you
    thinking? Don't bother me again before 2008.

Sheer idiocy. Why would anyone send her money at the moment,
instead of making donations towards the mid-term elections?
