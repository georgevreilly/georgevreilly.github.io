As I mentioned last month,
I participated in this year's AIDS Walk on Saturday.

I raised over `$1300 online
<http://www.lifelongevents.org/site/TR?px=1013411&pg=personal&fr_id=1080>`_,
handily exceeding my goal of $1,000.
I also raised another $300 in cash and checks at the fundraising barbecue
that we threw on September 1st.

I've lost count, but I believe that in the last 15 years, I've raised about
$10,000 for charity. Most of it has been for the Northwest AIDS Walk.
The last few years that I was at Microsoft,
I raised $2,000-$3,000 each year, thanks to the power of
`Microsoft matching
<http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/citizenship/giving/programs/employee.asp>`_,
which doubled the amount of money that I raised.
I've also raised money two years running for
`Ugandan orphans <http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/uganda.html>`_
sponsored by Vim:
`Microsoft Vim Users raised $2650 for orphans in Uganda
<http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/vimannounce/message/103>`_.

Go me! ;-)
