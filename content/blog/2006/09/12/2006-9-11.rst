Nine-Eleven. The date burned into everyone's brain. One of those dates
where everyone remembers where they were when they heard the news.
Emma and I awoke to the radio telling us that planes had crashed into the
World Trade Center. We went downstairs and watched the TV in horror.

For a time, an all-too-brief time, the country pulled together
in a show of unity and grief. The world joined us in an outpouring of
support.

There are many reasons why history will condemn George Bush, but one of the
most serious is his squandering that good will for quick partisan
advantage. A better man could have built a bipartisan consensus to tackle
terrorism in a serious way. Ask not what your country can do for you --
just go shopping.

He should have finished the job in Afghanistan. Instead, his attention
turned to fomenting the irrational, immoral Iraq war, which
turned the world against us.

In many ways, the terrorists have won. This country slides slowly towards a
police state, as Bush arrogates imperial powers to himself. Bush and bin
Laden have a symbiotic relationship. Bush has turned Iraq into a recruiting
ground for Al Qaeda. Bin Laden is the ever-threatening boogeyman to scare
the American people.
