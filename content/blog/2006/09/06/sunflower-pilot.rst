that our Video On Demand product is running a major pilot:

    Cable television operator Sunflower Broadband and MTV Networks today
    announced that they are launching a market-leading campaign to
    dynamically insert national advertisements into on-demand cable
    television. Sunflower will begin dynamically placing ads into MTV
    Networks on-demand programming this week. The first campaign, created
    and managed by the agency Mediaedge:cia, promotes the theatrical
    release of Paramount Pictures' and MTV Films' major motion picture
    "jackass number two", in theaters nationwide on September 22. Ads for
    the movie will be inserted into Comedy Central On Demand programs at
    the moment that viewers request the free on-demand shows.
