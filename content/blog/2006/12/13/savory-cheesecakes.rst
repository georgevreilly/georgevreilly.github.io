At work, we're having a Christmas party every day this week at 4pm.
Each day, a different team is responsible for providing food and drink.
Yesterday, my team provided Caipirinhas and some Brazilian food.
Today, we had Scotch and `savory cheesecakes`__!

I'm so used to cheesecakes being sweet
that it's never occurred to me that they could come any other way,
but I have to say that mushroom, pepper & pesto, and brie &hazelnut cheesecakes
are all quite tasty.
