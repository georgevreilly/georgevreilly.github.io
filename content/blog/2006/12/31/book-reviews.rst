Inspired by `Keith Martin's Reading Notes`_, I've decided to try writing
a short review of every book that I read, starting today.
I expect that most reviews will be 100 to 250 words.

Why? Like my `Picture of the Day project`_, it should help me think a 
little harder about what I'm reading, if I know that I'm going to have to
say something pithy about it.
I'm a better photographer than I am a reviewer,
so the exercise should be good for me.

Now you know why I put together a way of `Rating with Stars`_
for dasBlog yesterday.

The first two reviews have already been written and will follow shortly.

Technical Notes:

* `Abusing Amazon images`_ showed me how to grab the book covers.
* I'm using my Amazon Associates ID to link to the books,
  ``https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/``\ *ISBN*\ ``/georgvreill-20``
  Unless my readership grows signficantly larger,
  I'll be lucky if I haul in as much as $10 per year.
* Right now, I'm filling out a little template in a text file and generating HTML.
  In time, I hope to add some plumbing behind the scenes to generate
  automatic indexes of authors, keywords, etc.
  But first, some content.
