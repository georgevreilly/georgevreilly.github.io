The fourth installment in Traviss's series about the *wess'har*,
which began with `City of Pearl`_.
The plot is too complex to summarize here, and would make little
sense if you haven't read the preceding books.

This is intelligent, character-driven SF, written for adults.
A small cast of humans interact with four very different alien races,
far from home. These aliens are not Americans with green skin;
they live by different rules. The humans are flawed people who
struggle with complex issues.

Traviss's themes include ecology, ethics, and responsibility.
She also throws in some action and enough plot twists to
keep things unpredictable.

The books take a little getting used to, but pull me along.
I look forward to the projected remaining two books in the series.
