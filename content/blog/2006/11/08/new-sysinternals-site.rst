`SysInternals`_ has always been a source of great tools for troubleshooting
your system. FileMon, RegMon, Process Explorer, Handle, ListDlls, PsTools, DebugView:
all of these have earned a permanent place on my Windows installations.
Mark Russinovich, the co-founder, is a world-class hacker. He co-wrote
`Microsoft Windows Internals`_ *without* access to the Windows source.
It was he who discovered the `Sony Rootkit`_ and publicized it on his
`widely read blog`_.

Many people were somewhat disturbed to learn that
`Microsoft bought SysInternals`_ a few months ago,
that it would compromise the tools.

It seems not to be a problem. The tools have just been re-released on the
`TechNet SysInternals site`_. There's one new tool, `ProcMon`_, which
aggregates together FileMon, RegMon, and a process monitor.
And they've made the whole suite available as one zipfile, instead of
having to download each tool separately.
