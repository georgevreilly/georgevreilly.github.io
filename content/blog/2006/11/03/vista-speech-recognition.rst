I've seen a number of references to a Microsoft demo of speech recognition 
that went famously wrong, but it wasn't until this evening that I finally 
watched the `CNBC Video`_ that started the meme.

A TV reporter makes a snarky introduction then cuts to video of a Microsoft 
PM demoing the new speech recognition technology in Windows Vista.
``Dear Mom comma``, he says. ``Dear aunt,`` appears in Word. It gets worse 
from there. Funny stuff. Go watch the `original video`_.

But it's not the whole story. There's `another video`_ which sets the demo 
in context. Overall, the demo was reasonably successful and the speech 
commands worked fairly well.

If you think people talking into their cellphones is annoying now,
wait until you hear them talking at their computers!
