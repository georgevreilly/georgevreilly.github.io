    Andrew Sullivan and Christopher Hitchens on CNN

I don't have much time for either Andrew Sullivan or Christopher Hitchens.
Both of them bear a lot of blame for getting us into Iraq in the first 
place.

But here they are on `CNN <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB48J_0re2g&eurl=>`_
yesterday, ripping into Bush for saying that Rumsfeld 
is doing a fabulous job and that he and Cheney must stay until the end of 
his presidency.
