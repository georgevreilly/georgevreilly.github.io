For the last few months, every blog post that I've made has been 
accompanied by at least one image. Sometimes I already have an appropriate 
image. The rest of the time, I use whatever I could find after searching
`Google Images`_.

Earlier today, I came across `10 Tips for Google Image Search`_.
I particularly like the `Greasemonkey script`_ which allows you to
view the original image by clicking on the thumbnail.
