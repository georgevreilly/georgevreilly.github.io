In my wanderings, I recently came across two sites where you can ask all
kinds of strange questions, with a reasonable expectation of getting an
answer.

`Little Details <http://community.livejournal.com/little_details/>`_:
"writers have questions, other writers have answers".
A LiveJournal community for writers seeking all kinds of background
information for their plots. Some samples:

*   1920's cold remedies
*   Danish drinking songs
*   Control parents have over their children testifying.

`Ask MetaFilter <http://ask.metafilter.com/>`_ is more general purpose.
It's a good place to go when your question can't be reduced to a keyword
search on Google. Sample questions:

* What's the fastest and cheapest way to paint a red room white?
* Is there a program for the Mac that will scroll a window to capture a
    screenshot of its entire contents?
* I want to be my own YouTube/Google video. Is there an easy way to show
    videos on my own server embedded in a page?
* What's the best vegan substitute for lard?
