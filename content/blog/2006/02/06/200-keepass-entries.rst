I `blogged before`__ about KeePass__, a free password manager utility.
A few minutes ago, I added the 200th entry to my password database,
when I registered to download `VMware Server`__.

200 entries!
At one point or another, I've registered on a hell of a lot of websites.
I also use KeePass to keep track of credit card numbers,
software registration keys, and so on.
KeePass not only lets me use distinct, strong passwords for each site,
but it also lets me remember which sites I've registered on.
Some sites want me to use my email address; 
others prefer an alphanumeric username.

One friend reliably informs me that KeePass runs just fine under Wine__,
giving him a cross-platform way to manage his passwords.
