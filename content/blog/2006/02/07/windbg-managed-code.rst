I consider myself to be an expert WinDbg user,
when it comes to debugging unmanaged x86 code.
I haven't used WinDbg much on managed code,
and when I did, I found it quite painful.

Via `Scott Guthrie's blog`__, I discovered `Tess Ferrandez's blog`__.
Tess is an escalation engineer in PSS who specializes in ASP.NET and a WinDbg virtuoso.
Scott has a list of her `best posts`__.
Mind-blowing stuff, but not for the faint of heart.
