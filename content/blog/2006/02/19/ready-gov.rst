A friend sent me a Word document with a parody of the Department of
Homeland Security's `Ready.Gov <http://www.ready.gov>`_ website.
I googled and found an HTML copy of the parody
`here <http://www.msxnet.org/humour/terror_alert>`_.

Seriously, there is some useful information on `Ready.Gov <http://www.ready.gov>`_.
Which reminds me that Emma and I are long overdue in putting together some
disaster planning.

Here are some links that I put together a while back:

    * AlphaGeek's `5-part series on disaster preparedness at DailyKos
      <http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/9/9/161748/9747>`_
    * `3 days, 3 ways <http://www.3days3ways.org>`_
    * `City of Seattle Emergency Resources
      <http://www.cityofseattle.net/html/citizen/emergency_resources.htm>`_
    * `Scott Hanselman's 2006 resolution
      <http://www.hanselman.com/blog/2006ResolutionPrepare.aspx>`_
    * `ICE (In Case of Emergency) entries in your cellphone address book
      <http://www.snopes.com/crime/prevent/icephone.asp>`_

If there's any lesson that should be learned from Katrina, it's that
you need to have your own disaster plan in place.
