Back in October, I joined Atlas Solutions as a senior software engineer.
The company just held its first "partner summit",
to educate some of our key partners
on the kind of work we're doing and new developments.
An attendee `blogged <http://lindaburlison.blogspot.com/2006/02/atlas-partner-summit.html>`_ it.
I'm working on video on demand, the stuff that Scott Ferris talked about.

I saw some of the presentations being rehearsed last week,
but a lot of this is stuff that I've never seen before.
I come from a software background, after all, not an advertising background.
