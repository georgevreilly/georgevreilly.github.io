I `mentioned recently`__ that I would be walking in this year's AIDS Walk.
And so I did.

After months of dry, sunny weather in Seattle, I have grown unaccustomed to rain.
It was an unpleasant morning and an unpleasant shock.
The skies opened and I stood in an endless line waiting to register.
I raised $1180, which entitled me to huddle in the VIP tent, as the rain continued.
The rain finally let up about halfway along the route, as we debouched onto Broadway.

Thanks to my fellow Team BiNet Seattle fundraisers, Emily and Meghan,
who raised a few hundred more between them.
Double thanks to Emily for giving me a ride home afterwards.
