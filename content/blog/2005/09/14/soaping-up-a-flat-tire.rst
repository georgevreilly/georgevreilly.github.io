I learned a really clever trick at our workparty_ on Sunday.

We were using a dolly that we had borrowed from our neighbor Mary
to haul a heavy credenza up from the basement.
One of the tires was flat, which made the exercise even more difficult.

I got out my bicycle floor pump and started pumping,
but it was a waste of time.
The tire was tubeless and without any air,
so it just slipped loosely around the rim.
After a few minutes of futility,
Dale remembered something he had seen years before at a gas station.

He got a bowl of soapy water and a sponge,
and coated the metal rim and both rims of the tire with soapy water.
This created a film which held the air in.
Once there was a little air inside the tire,
it started inflating when I pumped
and the rim of the tire pushed against the metal rim, creating an airtight seal.
After that, it was only a minute's work to bring the tire up to the recommended 30psi.
