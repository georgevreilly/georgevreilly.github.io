I'm taking a beginner's `drawing class`_ at North Seattle Community
College. Today, we started on perspective. We began by watching a
45-minute `video by David Hockney`_, where he contrasts three paintings:
a Canaletto painting of Venice, and two Chinese scrolls painted
70 years apart.

The Canaletto is a classic `two-point linear perspective`_ painting.
Both of the Chinese scrolls show trips by the emperor along the
Grand Canal. The first one, by Wang Hui, is 27 inches high and 72 feet wide!
It uses multiple perspective to show scenes, in a manner
that is strange to my Western eyes. Hockney demonstrates how
effective it is. For example, he shows a corner where two streets
meet at right angles. On the "up" street, the viewer is on the left,
looking right, at the left side of the houses; on the street coming from
the left, we see the right side of the houses. I've made it
sound like a mess but it works. The scroll is a marvel of
teeming humanity in tiny detail. Most of the figures are
scarcely larger than Hockney's fingernail.

He contrasts it unfavorably with a scroll painted of a similar
trip by the emperor's grandson, after Western missionaries
had imported their notions of perspective. The second scroll
is flat and lifeless, though the perspective is more "correct"
to our eyes.

Worth seeing if you can find a copy.
