On Tuesday night, Emma sent this out to our list of friends.

    | From:   Emma Bartholomew

    Hello all,

    Thank you to everyone who has assisted George & me in our attempt to
    ready our home for hurricane evacuees.

    Regrettably, I have come to realize that I'm not emotionally able to
    make this commitment after all.  I thought I could open my home to
    others, but I have sunk into a depression over the past few weeks that
    has finally convinced me that I tried to bite off more than I could chew.

    George & I are still committed to helping evacuees, but we will now be
    doing this through donations of time and money to a local group,
    Katrina Housing Northwest `www.katrinahousingNW.org
    <http://www.katrinahousingNW.org>`_ I have attached the latest Katrina
    Housing Seattle Alert to the end of this message so you can get an idea
    of what the group is presently doing.

    We will be reimbursing those who gave us cash donations and having a
    party to thank those of you who gave of your time and effort.  Thank you
    again for all your hard work on our behalf.

    Warmest regards,
    Emma


    PS from George.

    This hasn't been an easy time for Emma and I know she feels that she's
    let you (and herself) down. I wish that matters had worked out
    otherwise. I thank all of you who selflessly gave of your time and
    money. It was inspiring to both of us.

        Hello KHNW supporters!

        This past Thursday a meeting was held in downtown Seattle with
        Representatives from the American Red Cross, The Emergency Management
        Division, The Seattle Housing Authority and many community
        organizations, and private ones such as ours.
        A representative kept us informed of the meetings results:

        *The Goal:* To communicate the Housing Sustainment Plan for the over
        1000 evacuees in our area right now. Specifically, funding and
        availability of LONG TERM PERMANENT HOUSING in their own homes.

        *The Answer:* They have not arrived at an answer yet.

        True, that is frustrating, and I could spend plenty of time venting
        about the details of the lack of planning, or the level of frustration
        my families and many others have experienced.
        *However*, the *immediate needs of our evacuees* still remain, and *our
        mission is to meet those needs*.
        Wherever and however we can. I am thoroughly committed to that.

        The good news for us is that I have partnered with Representatives from
        the American Red Cross King/Kitsap/Olympia chapters to help identify
        individual needs, and we are working directly with the International
        Rescue Committee ( `www.theirc.org <http://www.theirc.org/>`_) who are
        excellent allies in the progress towards KHNW being successful in their
        mission to assist.

        We are fortunate that we get to skip the red tape in all this. We are
        fueled entirely on the kindness of our local supporters. You have all
        been a key part of improving the lives of these people!

        We still have needs for these families and our organization. Those needs
        are:

        * Private housing for 12-18 months (evacuee family only) i.e empty
          apartments in Seattle area,  (services are in the city and they need to
          be close)
        * GIFT CARDS: For Target, Fred Meyer, Safeway, QFC, WALGREEN'S, Sears,
          Ikea, Rite Aid, Office Max, COSTCO for household items, etc...
        * GAS CARDS: For our volunteer drivers who are burning through the fuel
          to drive these folks around until they get bus passes, cars etc...
        * A Tax Attorney to offer pro-bono time to assist with the 501c (3)
          status filing.
        * A PT Non Profit Accountant, volunteer

        If you are interested in any of these items, just email me at
        `nhnorthwest@gmail.com <mailto:nhnorthwest@gmail.com>`_ and/or
        `northwestRR@gmail.com <mailto:northwestRR@gmail.com>`_ (that is Jessica's
        email, our amazing admin)
        Want to get a group involved? Please organize support through your
        office, schools, places of worship, etc... we can provide you with
        posters/flyer's etc...!

        This continues to be a very important and increasingly more organized
        effort. We have surpassed the point where we only coordinated short term
        emergency housing, and now we are in it for the long haul, providing
        solutions for many needs.

        *Thank you ALL* so very very much for your kindness, support, assistance
        and generosity. I never know how to express enough how much it means to
        me, and all the people you help, that you have done so much in such
        distressing times for them.

        Truly,

We received some very touching, understanding responses from our friends,
often acknowledging their own struggles with depression, and thanking
us for doing what we had so far.

As for the basement, Chuck came over this morning and helped me frame out
the 11-foot opening. The carpet layers are coming in at the end of the
week, and I expect the window people to come next week.
