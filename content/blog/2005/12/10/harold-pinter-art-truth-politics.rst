Harold Pinter's `speech <http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2005/pinter-lecture-e.html>`_
on accepting the 2005 Nobel Prize for Literature.

    I put to you that the United States is without doubt the greatest show on the road.
    Brutal, indifferent, scornful and ruthless it may be
    but it is also very clever.
    As a salesman it is out on its own
    and its most saleable commodity is self love.
    It's a winner.
    Listen to all American presidents on television say the words,
    'the American people', as in the sentence,
    'I say to the American people it is time to pray
    and to defend the rights of the American people
    and I ask the American people to trust their president
    in the action he is about to take on behalf of the American people.'

    It's a scintillating stratagem.
    Language is actually employed to keep thought at bay.
    The words 'the American people' provide a truly voluptuous cushion of reassurance.
    You don't need to think.
    Just lie back on the cushion.
    The cushion may be suffocating your intelligence and your critical faculties
    but it's very comfortable.
    This does not apply of course to the 40 million people living below the poverty line
    and the 2 million men and women imprisoned in the vast gulag of prisons,
    which extends across the US.
