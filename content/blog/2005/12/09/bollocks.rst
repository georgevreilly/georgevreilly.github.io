My friend Raven knows far too much about prostates__. She sent me this the other day.

    Don't forget that conducting regular testicular self-exams
    (or getting someone else to do it for you :)
    is a very important part of keeping healthy.
    If detected early, testicular cancer is very curable:

    But you need to commit to doing it regularly,
    not to just doing it every once in a while, or when the mood strikes you.

    Because as everyone knows, sometimes you like feeling nuts;
    sometimes, you don't.

And, on a not completely unrelated note,
`males with big testicles have smaller brains`__
-- at least in the case of bats.
