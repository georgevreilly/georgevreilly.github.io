As the Twelve Days of Christmas approach,
it's time once again to make fun of them.
Strictly speaking, we can't start until
December 25th, the first day of Christmas,
but the Xmas season starts earlier every year.

My favorite has long been Frank Kelly's *Christmas Countdown*,
which was a big hit in Ireland and Britain in the early 1980s.
It's couched as twelve increasingly exasperated letters from
Gobnait O'Lughnasa to his friend Nuala. Here's Day Six:

    Nuala,

    What are you trying to do to us ? It isn’t that we don’t appreciate
    your generosity but the six geese have not alone nearly murdered the
    calling birds but they laid their eggs on top of the vet’s head from the
    pear-tree and his bill was £68 in cash ! My mother is munching 60 grains of
    Valium a day and talking to herself in a most alarming way. You must keep
    your feelings for me in check.

    Gobnait
