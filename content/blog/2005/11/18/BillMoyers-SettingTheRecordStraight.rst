    McCarthyism was a raging plague in the 1950s
    and the virus rampaged across Texas like tumbleweeds in a wind storm.
    ...
    The low point, said Maverick, came when the state Senate passed a bill
    to remove all books from public libraries which “adversely” reflected
    on American and Texas history, the family and religion.
    Even the state teachers association endorsed the bill,
    in exchange for a pay raise. ...

    That was the lay of the land in the 1950s.
    And Democrats were in charge, remember?
    That’s right: Texas was a one-party state;
    Republicans were as scarce in high office as Democrats are today.
    No matter the players, one-party government is a conspiracy in disguise.

    ...

    Everything President George W. Bush knows, he learned here [in Texas],
    as the product of a system rigged to assure the political progeny
    needed to perpetuate itself with minimum interference
    from the nuisances of liberal democracy.
    ...
    With the election of 2000,
    he and his cohorts arrived in Washington like atheists taking over the Vatican;
    they had come to run a government they don’t believe in.
