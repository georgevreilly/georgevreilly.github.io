I'm indifferent to most fantasy books, but I've been a fan of
George R.R. Martin's *A Song of Ice and Fire* series,
since I read the first book,
`A Game of Thrones <https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553573403/georgvreill-20>`_,
in 1997.
I read the second book
`A Clash of Kings <https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553108034/georgvreill-20>`_,
in 1999.
The third book
`A Storm of Swords <https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055357342X/georgvreill-20>`_
came out five years ago, and I've been awaiting
the fourth book,
`A Feast for Crows <https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553801503/georgvreill-20>`_,
ever since.
After several postponements, it's finally out.
 
It's an epic tale of love, war, and intrigue.
Five Kings are fighting for control,
by sword, by guile, and sometimes by magic.
Strange creatures are rising in the frozen North, beyond the Wall.
Dragons are reappearing in the South.
The young Starks, separated by fate and a cruel author,
strive in vain to reunite.
The Lannisters, mad and bad, seek to dominate.

I'm re-reading the series and rediscovering how good it is.
The characters are clearly drawn,
the plotting first rate,
the writing excellent.

George R.R. Martin is on a
`book tour of the U.S. <http://www.georgerrmartin.com/appearances.html>`_
and appears at the
`University of Washington Bookstore <http://www.bookstore.washington.edu/trade.taf?dept=attribute&category=events&par=trade&ttl=events&page=1>`_
on Monday, November 21st, at 7pm.
