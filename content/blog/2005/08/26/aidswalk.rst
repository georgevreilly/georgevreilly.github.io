On Saturday 10th September 2005, over 8,000 people will participate in
the Northwest AIDS Foundation Walk. I will be one of them, as I have
been every year since 1992.

To sponsor me, please visit my `Donation Page`_.

I had originally signed up to march with Team Microsoft.
Then we in `BiNet Seattle`_ decided to form a team.
Please join `Team BiNet Seattle`_: we'd love to have you.

It's been more than 20 years since AIDS was first recognized. AIDS is
still wreaking devastation in Africa and Asia, and affecting many in the
U.S.  Although the new protease inhibitors are helping many people in
the West, the AIDS epidemic is far from over. For one thing, the new
drugs are not a cure. When they work well, they enable people with AIDS
to lead an active life and live much longer than before. But one-third
of people with access to medical treatment do not respond to that
treatment. The new drugs are horrendously expensive (about $15,000 per
year), so they're out of reach of 95% of the people living with AIDS
around the world. (Recently, the large pharmaceutical companies have
come to some agreements to make their drugs available at much cheaper
rates in the Third World, but millions of people still have no access to
the drugs.) Furthermore, somewhere between 550 and 1,100 Washingtonians
are infected every year, one-quarter of them under the age of 22. More
than 85% of the people diagnosed with AIDS in Washington State since
1995 are still alive---a marked improvement on the situation before the
protease inhibitors became available. All of this means that there's a
continuing need for money to help fight the epidemic.

In addition to funding the Lifelong AIDS Alliance's own services, the
money raised will be distributed to other AIDS organizations throughout
Washington State. The Lifelong AIDS Alliance (formerly the Northwest
AIDS Foundation and the Chicken Soup Brigade) provides a variety of
services to HIV+ people and people living with AIDS in Washington: Food,
housing, rent subsidies, in-home care, groceries, educational material,
and much more.  See http://www.lifelongaidsalliance.org for more details.

If you'd like to walk yourself, please visit

Microsoft, that matches charitable contributions, be sure to list your
company name.

I thank you, Lifelong AIDS Alliance thanks you, and the people your
donation will help thank you.
