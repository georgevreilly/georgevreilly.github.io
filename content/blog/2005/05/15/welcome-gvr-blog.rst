This is my third blog.
I've had a `technical blog`__ at `Weblogs @ ASP.NET`__ for the last year,
and a `defunct blog`__ at `EraBlog`__ for another year.

I've been meaning to set up a blog at my personal website for a while,
one that allows me to post about anything that I feel like.
Posting about non-technical matters is discouraged at Weblogs.asp.net.

So here it is.
(Assuming I've set it up correctly) I will be cross-posting technical posts to weblogs.asp.net.
Other posts will appear here exclusively.
