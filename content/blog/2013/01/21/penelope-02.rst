Last night, I read the first third of the chapter.
Tonight I will read more.

I described it as “badly punctuated.”
There's no punctuation at all!
No apostrophes, no commas, no periods.
The “sentences” are separated by paragraph breaks.

So far, Molly Bloom has thought back to Mrs Riordan,
an obnoxious elderly neighbor whom Leopold Bloom flattered;
sickness;
Bloom's infidelities, present and past;
her own seductions and confessions;
sex and childbirth;
jealousy;
aggravating husbands.

In the second paragraph:
men are all so different;
how strange Bloom is;
Bloom is “mad on the subject of drawers”;
their first sexual encounter;
punctuality;
a potential singing trip to Belfast with both Bloom and Blazes Boylan, her paramour;
her last concert;
hating politics;
money;
well-dressed men;
losing weight, face lotion, and beauty on the wane;
the sordid books he brings her;
Bloom could do better than his advertising job;
Bloom thinking he knows a lot about women's dress.

And of course lots more that I didn't note here.
