I've spent time over the last three weeks
working on a new website for the `Northwest C++ Users' Group`_.
I blogged about the `NWCPP website refresh`_ over there.
In brief, I moved the website
from an instance of the Joomla_ Content Management System at `Just Host`_
to a static website generated by Pelican_ and hosted at `Github Pages`_,
and I'm happy with the results.

Not only am I the Webmaster (and Secretary) of NWCPP,
I am also the webmaster for several other organizations:

* `Wild Geese Players of Seattle`_,
  a static HTML site badly in need of a makeover
  (I'm the Director, Dramaturg, and Webmaster).
* `Freely Speaking Toastmasters`_,
  a dynamic site based on the horrid `FreeToastHoast 2.0`_ software;
  also our `Easy-Speak`_ club management site
  (Webmaster/Immediate Past President).
* `BiNet Seattle`_, a small static HTML site
  (Webmaster/Past President).
* `TCD Alumni PNW`_, a Tumblr_ blog
  (Webmaster/Founder).
* And my `personal site`_ and `personal blog`_;
  the blog is based on dasBlog_
  but all the content is authored in reStructuredText_.

I'm seriously considering converting the Wild Geese site and
my personal site to Pelican_.
As I said in the conclusion of the `NWCPP website refresh`_ post,
it works for me,
but it wouldn't be suitable for someone who isn't familiar
with reStructuredText, Git, and Python.
