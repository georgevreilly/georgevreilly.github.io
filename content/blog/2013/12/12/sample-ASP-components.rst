From October 1996 to May 1997, I wrote a number of sample components
for the then-new `Active Server Pages <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages>`_
(Classic ASP).
I worked for MicroCrafts, a consulting company in Redmond, WA;
the samples were written for Microsoft's
`Internet Information Server <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services>`_
(IIS) team.
Most of the components used Microsoft's new
`Active Template Library <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Template_Library>`_ (ATL),
a C++ library for COM.

This work had two important consequences for me:
Microsoft recruited me to join the IIS development team
to work on improving ASP performance for IIS 3,
and Wrox Press invited me to write
`Beginning ATL COM Programming <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1861000111/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1861000111&linkCode=as2&tag=georgvreill-20>`_
I was originally supposed to be the sole author of the book,
but I was a slow writer and I was caught up in the IIS 4 deathmarch,
so Wrox brought in three more co-authors to complete the book.
A fourth co-author was brought in for the second edition,
`Beginning ATL 3 COM Programming <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1861001207/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1861001207&linkCode=as2&tag=georgvreill-20>`_.
As for IIS, I spent seven years on the team,
where in addition to leading the performance team,
I also worked on the
`http.sys <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/a2a45c42-38bc-464c-a097-d7a202092a54.mspx?mfr=true>`_
kernel driver that was released in Windows Server 2003 (IIS 6).

For many years, these components could be found at
`http://www.georgevreilly.com/sample-ASP-components.html </sample-ASP-components.html>`_.
I'm making them available now at
`Github <https://github.com/georgevreilly/sample-ASP-components>`_.
