Tuesday December 10th was my last day at `Cozi <http://www.cozi.com>`_.
I had recently rolled off a major project that lasted for most of a year,
and the timing was good to go do something else.
In my six years there,
I made lasting friendships and I built a lot of software that makes me proud.
Cozi has about 15 engineers, small enough that I worked on most of the software,
notably on the web services that power everything else
and on the web client application,
though not, alas, on the iOS or Android applications.
Cozi was a great place to work
and I knew I wanted to replicate what I valued there,
working with a team of engineers that I liked and respected,
building interesting software in a variety of technologies,
at a small company.

I started my job search just before Thanksgiving,
expecting to spend several weeks,
but I didn't reckon with the demand in the Seattle market
for experienced software developers.
I sent out several applications
and heard very little during Thanksgiving week.
The next week, my job search caught fire.
In the space of a little more than 24 hours,
I had set up interview loops or informationals
with CEOs at four different startups.
I gave notice at Cozi later that week,
as it was apparent that I would be leaving soon.

I had heard back from all of the startups where I interviewed by Thursday of last week.
After considering their offers,
I accepted a position at `CookBrite <http://cookbrite.com/>`_,
a stealth-mode early-stage startup in Pioneer Square,
where I will be one of the first developers.
I've never joined a company so early before and I'm looking forward to the opportunity.
The founders have done a lot of planning and market research,
and I like what they've shown me.
I start there on Thursday, December 19th.

I knew that there was more demand than supply in the Seattle software market,
but I was still blindsided by the speed at which this came together.
There are a lot of jobs for talented software developers.
All modesty aside, I do have a `great résumé <http://www.linkedin.com/in/georgevreilly>`_.
In fact, CookBrite first contacted me a couple of weeks before I started looking,
via `Stack Overflow Careers <http://careers.stackoverflow.com/>`_.

Outside my tech bubble, I know it's not so easy to find work.
Many of my friends are struggling on the margins,
as are millions of others, in America and elsewhere.
I wish I could spread some of that employability fairydust around.

Meanwhile, I'm taking a few days off before starting my new job.
