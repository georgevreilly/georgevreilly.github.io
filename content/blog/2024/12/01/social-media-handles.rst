The migration away from Twitter has really caught fire lately,
with Bluesky being the obvious winner of new accounts in recent weeks.

I'm available on other platforms, if you want to follow me.
These are sorted from most to least active:

- Bluesky: `@georgevreilly.bsky.social <https://bsky.app/profile/georgevreilly.bsky.social>`__
- Threads: `@georgevreilly <https://www.threads.net/@georgevreilly>`__
- Instagram: `georgevreilly <https://www.instagram.com/georgevreilly/>`__
- Substack: `@georgevreilly <https://substack.com/@georgevreilly>`__
- LinkedIn: `georgevreilly <https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgevreilly/>`__
- GitHub: `@georgevreilly <https://github.com/georgevreilly>`__
- Twitter: `@georgevreilly <https://x.com/georgevreilly>`__ (going dormant soon)
- Mastodon: `@georgevreilly@tech.lgbt <https://tech.lgbt/@georgevreilly>`__
- Discord: ``@georgevreilly``
- Reddit: `u/george_v_reilly <https://www.reddit.com/user/george_v_reilly/>`__
- Tumblr: `@georgevreilly <https://www.tumblr.com/georgevreilly>`__
- TikTok: `@georgevreilly <https://www.tiktok.com/@georgevreilly>`__

Basically, I'm ``georgevreilly`` everywhere,
except for a few old accounts from the 2000s where I used ``george_v_reilly``.

I have a sweatshirt from attending CascadiaJS in 2012
that has ``@georgevreilly`` along the length of the left sleeve.
It was either my Twitter or my GitHub handle (which are, of course, identical).

I can also be reached via:

- Linktree: `georgevreilly <https://linktr.ee/georgevreilly>`__
- About.me: `georgevreilly <https://about.me/georgevreilly>`__
