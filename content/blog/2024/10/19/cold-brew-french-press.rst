Last year, I posted a recipe for `cold brew coffee`_
using an `Oxo Cold Brew Coffee Maker`_.
Recently, it occurred to me that I could use a French Press instead of the Oxo.
I've made several batches, with good results.
It's a little more convenient to make cold brew in the Oxo,
but it's good to know that it can be made
without buying special-use equipment.

Ingredients
-----------

* 24 fl oz (700 ml) water
* 6 oz (170 g) fresh *coarsely ground* coffee.
  Store-bought pre-ground coffee is too fine.

This will fill a one-quart (one-liter) French Press.
It **yields about 16 fl oz** (1 pt/500 ml) of cold brew coffee.

Instructions
------------

* Grind the coffee beans coarsely.
* Place the ground coffee in the French Press.
* Pour water into the grounds, distributing it as best you can.
* Stir gently to ensure that all coffee grounds are wet.
* Cover the French Press with plastic wrapâ€”\
  this prevents absorption of odors in the fridge.
* Store it in the fridge, for anywhere between 6 and 24 hours.
* Remove the plastic wrap, insert the plunger, and plunge.
* Pour the brew through a coffee filter
  to strain any fine grounds that get past the plunger.
* Refrigerate the cold brew.
