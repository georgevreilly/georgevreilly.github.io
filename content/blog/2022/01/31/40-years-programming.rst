40 years ago this month,
I sat down at a computer and wrote a program.
(Or "programme", as I spelled it then.)
It was the first time I had ever used a computer.
Very few people had used computers in 1982,
in Ireland or elsewhere.

What was the program?
No idea.
Just a few lines of AppleSoft Basic.
But it was enough to get me hooked and change my life.

I still get a hit when a little bit of code unlocks in my brain.
It's quite addictive.
There's always more to learn and to see.

I wrote more about this in 2012: `30 Years of Programming`_.
