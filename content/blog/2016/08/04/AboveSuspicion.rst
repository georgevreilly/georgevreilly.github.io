In the summer of 1939,
Richard and Frances Myles are approached at their Oxford college
to do a simple-sounding spy-related task during their upcoming European vacation.
One thing leads to another until eventually
these amateur spies are on the run in the Tyrol.
MacInnes had traveled in Europe in the 1930s
and brings a strong sense of place to the locations she describes,
as well as a strong dislike of the totalitarianism that the Germans had fallen into.
