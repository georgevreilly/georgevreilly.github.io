Gabriel Weinberg has a great Medium post about `Useful Mental Models`__.
‘There is a much smaller set of concepts, however, that come up repeatedly
in day-to-day decision making, problem solving, and truth seeking.
As [Charlie] Munger says,
“80 or 90 important models will carry about 90% of the freight
in making you a worldly‑wise person.”’
He notes ‘my definition of mental model differs from some others,
with mine being more broadly defined as any concept
that helps explain, analyze, or navigate the world.’
