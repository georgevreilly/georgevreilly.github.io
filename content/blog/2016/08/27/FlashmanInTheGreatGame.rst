`Flashman in the Great Game`__ finds Flashy back to India,
sent there by prime minister Lord Palmerston
to look into worrying rumors of mutiny amongst the Indian troops
and to sweet talk the recalcitrant Rani of Jhansi.
After an attempt upon his life by Thugees,
Flashman goes undercover in the native cavalry at Meerut,
where the `Sepoy Mutiny`__ begins soon after.
He then finds himself in the Siege of Cawnpore and the Siege of Lucknow
and imprisoned at Gwalior before being almost executed as a mutineer.
Having survived all of this bloodshed,
he receives a knighthood and the Victoria Cross,
and learns that he has been immortalized as a bully and a cad
in the newly published book, *Tom Brown's School Days*.

Flashman is forced by circumstances to act heroically several times
(having an unearned reputation for bravery can lead to
unrefusable requests for more of the same).
To the detriment of the book,
Fraser goes through contortions to find reasons for Flashman to be present
at most of the major events of the Mutiny.
Even so, a solid addition to the `Flashman Papers`__.
