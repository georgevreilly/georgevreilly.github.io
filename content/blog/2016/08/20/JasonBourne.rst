In `Jason Bourne`_,
the eponym is back in action, running around the planet
in a personal vendetta with the director of the CIA.
Bourne's old ally Nicky Parsons is killed trying to pass him some information
that she's unearthed about the Treadstone program
that turned David Webb into the amnesiac assassin known as Jason Bourne.
The CIA director sends a killer known only as the Asset after Bourne,
while the fresh-faced head of the Cyber Ops division does her best to keep Bourne alive.

This is a largely unnecessary sequel to the Bourne franchise.
While the action scenes are good,
the plot is tired and the characters are unappealing.
