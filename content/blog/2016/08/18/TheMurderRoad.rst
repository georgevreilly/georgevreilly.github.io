Detective Inspector Ben Cooper, newly promoted, is leading the team
that's investigating the murder of a lorry driver outside a remote Peak District village.
It seems to be connected to a suicide that took place the same day, but how?
Cooper and his team manage to peel back the layers surrounding the dual mysteries.

Booth writes solidly plotted, solidly characterized novels,
and this is another good entry in his long-running Cooper & Fry series.
