AIDS decimated the gay community in the 1980s and early 1990s
before effective treatments were developed,
and AIDS and HIV continue to affect the LGBT community disproportionately.
I personally have walked in the Seattle AIDS Walk every year since 1992.

Please sponsor me at https://give.lifelong.org/georgevreilly
I am also the captain of the `Freely Speaking Toastmasters team`__
and we'd love to have you join us.

Any money you donate or raise will `support people in King County`__
who are living with HIV or AIDS.
It will help feed them, pay for medicine, and prevent further infections.

I've walked for 25 years to honor the living and the dead.
I've known people who died of AIDS and I know people who are living with it.
I have friends who lost lovers and I have friends who lost dozens of people.

The AIDS Walk takes place on Saturday, September 24th, 2016 at Volunteer Park.

I thank you, the Lifelong AIDS Alliance thanks you, and the people you'll be helping thank you.
