I've long been a fan of `Edward Tufte`_'s work.
I'm also a fan of `old-style serif fonts`_, such as `Bembo`_.

I happened across the `R Studio Tufte Handout Style`_ yesterday,
and I was immediately struck by how much it resembles Tufte's books.
It uses `Tufte CSS`_ and the open-source `Tufte Book Font`_.
ETBook is a “computer version” of Bembo that Tufte constructed
for the more recent editions of his books,
supplanting the lead type of the earlier editions.

I've adapted this blog's stylesheet to use ETBook
and some of the other settings from tufte.css.
It's not completely faithful;
e.g., headings are bold, not italic.
