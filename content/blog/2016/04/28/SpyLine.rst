`Spy Line`_ is the sequel to `Spy Hook`_.
Bernard Samson is on the run from MI6 in East Berlin
after asking unwelcome questions about a slush fund.
Eventually they settle their differences
and MI6 sends him on a mission to Vienna,
where he learns that his wife Fiona,
widely believed to be a traitor who had defected to the KGB,
was in fact a double agent.
Samson is world-weary but shocked to learn that the truth of his wife's supposed defection
had been hidden from him by Fiona and by the handful of superiors who knew the truth.

A satisfying middle book in this trilogy.
