Railroad diagrams aka `syntax diagrams`_ have never really taken off.
I've only come across two memorable uses of them,
in a Pascal textbook that I used as a freshman
and on `JSON.org`_.
The former was surely influenced by Niklaus Wirth's *Pascal User Manual*,
which also used them.
For communicating with laypeople,
the simple diagrams convey much more information than a textual grammar.

There are a few tools which can generate such diagrams from EBNF grammars,
including the `online Railroad Diagram Generator`_
and the `Railroad-diagram Generator library`_.
Other tools can be found in the answers to the `StackOverflow question`_.
