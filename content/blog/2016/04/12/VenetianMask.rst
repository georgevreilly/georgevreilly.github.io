Six people arrange to meet in Venice for Carnival,
masked and costumed as their true selves.
Not knowing how the others are costumed,
each makes very different—and wrong—assumptions.
Brian, husband of Sally and lover of Jean-Pierre, is found dead.
Surely one of the group is the killer.
An effete local, Count Michele Zanon, takes an interest in the affair.

A strange novel whose plot hinges on
miscommunication, mistaken identities, and incorrect assumptions,
as the seven protagonists rush around Venice,
seeking or hiding from each other.
