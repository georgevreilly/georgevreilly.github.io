A student is found murdered on the grounds of Trinity College Dublin.
Sergeant Matt Minogue, newly back on duty after serious injuries,
investigates and eventually finds links to the violence
then roiling Northern Ireland.

A slow-moving but thoughtful police procedural.
Minogue may be traumatized by earlier injuries,
but he is not the cynical, hard-drinking policeman so typical of fiction,
but rather a happily married father with a nose for the truth.
