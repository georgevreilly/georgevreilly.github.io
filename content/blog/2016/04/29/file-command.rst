I had forgotten all about the `file command`_
until it was mentioned in a StackOverflow answer today.
If you run ``file some.iso``, it will display the label embedded in the disk image.
More generally, you can run ``file`` on many different kinds of files
and it will do a decent job of identifying the type of data.
