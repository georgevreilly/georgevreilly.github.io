Good old Bertie Wooster's got a spot of bother
and so has his aged relative, Aunt Dahlia.
A young lady authoress has grown tired of her tedious fiancé,
one “Stilton” Cheesewright by name, and set her sights on our hero.
Dash it all, she'd want to improve a chap's mind,
when he'd rather take a cigarette for a walk and enjoy Jeeves' cocktails.
And Cheesewright's a hulking brute threatening to break B.W.'s spine in five places.
But Jeeves comes through in the end,
saving Bertie and Aunt D.

`Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit`_ is a fine example
of P.G. Wodehouse's apparently effortless prose.
Bertie's blithe piffle conjures up high society and long weekends at great houses
in those halcyon days between the wars.
Jeeves himself makes only brief appearances,
as Bertie fends for himself with middling success.

Good stuff, what!
