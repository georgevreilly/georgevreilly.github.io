We received an unsolicited copy of this ridiculous book in the mail.
It drones on and on about Satan and his plans,
bashing both Catholics and Protestants.
Apparently, ‘Sunday worship is “the mark of the beast!”’.
Who knew? Who cares.

I assumed that it's from the Seventh Day Adventists,
though I couldn't confirm that from skimming it.
However, `Catholic Answers`_ confirms my guess.

Best avoided, especially on Sundays.
