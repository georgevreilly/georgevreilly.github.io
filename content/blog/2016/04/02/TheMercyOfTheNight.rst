Jacqi Garza was abducted when she was eight.
She got away but her life has gone far off course in decade since.
Now she's the prime witness to a murder.
Phelan Tierney, a former lawyer, has taken her under his wing,
but she's not easy to help.

This is dark and disturbing, if ultimately hopeful.
It's a portrait of a town in distress
and of some of its citizens.
Some are still trying to make a difference,
while others are too lost in their own pain and woes to care anymore.
Jacqi seems lost in a hell due to her awful family and her trauma
compounded by her own self-destructiveness,
but Phelan sees a spark in her.
His girlfriend, Cass, is troubled by his whiteknighting.
And Skellenger, the cop, feels guilty about mishandling her abduction case.
