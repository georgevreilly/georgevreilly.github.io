Damn my `supraorbital ridge`_ anyway!
I spent at least half an hour tonight scouring the entire house for a small suitcase,
only to find it within 3 feet of the back doorâ€”but above my eyeline.
Someone (probably me) had placed the suitcase on a high shelf a couple of weeks ago.
I simply didn't think to look up.
Most humans don't.
Our ancestors must not have worried too much about predators dropping from above.
