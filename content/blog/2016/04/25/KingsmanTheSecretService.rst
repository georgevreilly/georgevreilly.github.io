In `Kingsman: The Secret Service`_,
“Eggsy” Unwin (Taron Egerton) is a fish-out-of-water recruit
in Kingsman, an exclusive private intelligence service.
The young chav_ is taken under the wing of Harry Hart (Colin Firth),
whose life was saved by Eggsy's father seventeen years ago.
After spending half the movie trying to survive Spy Hogwarts,
Eggsy goes out on his first mission
to stop the megalomaniac billionare (Samuel L. Jackson)
who is about to cull most of the world's population.

Stylish, hyper-stylized, and violent—\
as might be expected in a movie adapted from a comic book.
The violence is often over the top,
particularly in the church massacre scene.
Still, it's entertaining enough in a crass way.
