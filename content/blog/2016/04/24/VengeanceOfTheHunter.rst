After the events of `Valor of the Healer`_,
the three protagonists went in different directions,
but now they must come together again.
Faanshi, the former slave girl, is coming into her own
as an extraordinarily powerful healer with her new people, the elves.
Kestar, formerly a Hawk sworn to expunge elven magic,
is a prisoner of the Hawks being taken to stand trial.
Julian, his lost hand and burnt-out eye regrown by Faanshi's magic,
is seeking vengeance against the brother who maimed him.
Rumors of Faanshi's power and accomplishments are fueling uprisings
as the discontented masses throw off the yoke of Adalonian power.

It's not uncommon for the `second book in a trilogy`_ to be the weakest.
I've yet to read the third book, but this one delivers:
the principal characters grow and face new problems;
the plot moves along and takes some interesting turns;
and new characters are introduced with their own motivations.
