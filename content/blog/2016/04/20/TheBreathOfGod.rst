This book fails both as a `Sherlock Holmes pastiche`_ and as an adventure.
The story is narrated by Watson,
but the protagonist neither sounds nor acts much like Watson.
Holmes is elsewhere for much of the book and he is very annoying when present.
The plot is a preposterous mashup of steampunk and occult magick.

As in `The Sherlockian`_, this author does not have the skill
to write a convincing Holmes–Watson novel.
I deducted another half star for the shoddy editing and the `comma splices`_.
