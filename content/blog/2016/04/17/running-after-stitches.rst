I had a `mole excised`_ from my lower calf three weeks ago,
after a biopsy found that it was “abnormal”.
The biopsy on the excised remainder came back clean.
I went back to the surgeon's office during the week to have the stitches removed.
It turns out that the stitches were dissolvable,
but I hadn't peeled back the wrapping to take a look.
I was given the all-clear to resume exercising
and for the rest of the week, I cycled to the office.
Today was my first run:
a 3-mile course to the Seward Park Caffè Vita.
The scar didn't bother me, but I had to stop and walk a few days,
as I'm out of condition.
