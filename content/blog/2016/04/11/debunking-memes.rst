Some days on Facebook,
it seems like I spend half my time being *that guy*,
the killjoy who debunks the false memes.
One that I've debunked many times in the last few weeks
is the one that claims Sandra Day O'Connor
called the GOP a group of "vile, petulant, hateful" obstructionists.
Although I (and many of my friends) agree with that sentiment,
O'Connor never said it.
`Snopes`_\ —as usual— is on the job
and points out that the `GOP Obstructionists`_ meme
is due to sloppy punctuation that then went viral.

In the last week, I've seen what purports to be a poster
from a 1970s anti-drink driving campaign,
often supposedly in Ireland,
which says,
“Driving? Don't have that fifth pint!”
It's actually taken from a `2009 comedy book`_.

If people would actually take 30 seconds to verify what they're posting,
there would be less bullshit out there.
I shan't hold my breath.
