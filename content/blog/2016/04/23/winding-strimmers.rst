I bought a new strimmer last weekend and used it agressively today,
revealing a once grass-covered pathway that I hadn't seen in years
and edging the parkway in front of my house very neatly.
Naturally, I exhausted the line on the spool.
I bought refill line and wound it onto the spool.
It seems to work better than on my previous strimmer,
which would jam or break every couple of minutes.
I took more care than in the past and I very carefully and snugly wound the line,
trying to minimize crossings or loose areas.
I've seen a recommendation to `soak the line`_ to make it more pliable.
I'll try that next time.
