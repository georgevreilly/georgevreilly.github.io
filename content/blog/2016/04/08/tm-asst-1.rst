I signed up for a three-part `Android Study Jam`_
organized by the Seattle Google Developer Group,
at the behest of a colleague who is also one of the organizers.
The last session takes place tomorrow morning.

I've built a little Android app that I call the `Toastmasters Assistant`_
for the final project.
It doesn't do very much yet,
except present some information about Toastmasters meetings, roles, and speeches
in an ``ExpandableListView``.
I have some ambitions to do more with it.
Specifically, I want to add a speech timer.
