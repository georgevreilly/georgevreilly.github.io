How have I never discovered `Sizes.com`_ before?
It's been around for 20 years
and it seems to be an authoritative source
on the sizes of all kinds of things:
screw threads, shoe sizes, horse collars, cake pans,
comas, chronologies, gross national happiness,
vehicle identification numbers, and much more.
I discovered it when looking up `penny nails`_.
