`Without an Address, You’re No One`_ introduced me to `What3Words`_,
an innovative system that uses just three English words to address
any 3m×3m square on the planet.
These words are drawn from a 40,000-word vocabulary.
A 3m×3m square is precise enough to identify a particular doorway in a large building
or a towel on a crowded beach.

I spent much of my childhood living at `uses.pills.crunch`_ (Dublin).
I spent ten years working at `navy.clear.poems`_ (Microsoft's Redmond campus).
If I pinpointed the buildings that I worked in,
they would each have completely different w3w addresses.

It reminds me a little of `Diceware`_ which strings together several words
to form an easy-to-remember but hard-to-crack password.

I said “English words” above but I lied.
W3w is actually available in multiple languages,
though many of them use a 25,000-word vocabulary,
which omits the seas.
