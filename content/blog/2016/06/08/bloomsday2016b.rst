I wrote in `Preparing Bloomsday Scripts`_ back in late March,
that I was getting ready for this year's reading of *Ulysses*.
Our `2016 Reading`_ is a week and a half away, on Sunday June 19th.
We'll be reading Chapters 3 (“Proteus”) and 6 (“Hades”)
of James Joyce's masterpiece at the Seattle Central Library.
We had our first full readthrough at tonight's rehearsal,
one hour fifty five minutes.
Next week, our dress rehearsal.
