Detective Inspector Fin McLeod hasn't been back
to the `Isle of Lewis`_ in twenty years,
but he's been seconded to the task force investigating a murder.
The dead man had bullied Fin and his friends throughout their childhood.
Returning home brings up a lot that had been long buried: secrets and resentments.
Fin's childhood and youth is gradually revealed throughout the book,
informing his present-day investigation.
He acted badly in the past and that has not been forgotten.

May skillfully weaves these two tales together,
revealing details of character and plot,
all the while evoking the `rugged beauty of the Hebrides`_.
