Nick Behrends wakes up after a party at a drug dealer's house on Ibiza
with a gun in his hand,
no memory of the last few hours,
and a roomful of dead people.
He goes on the run,
and soon encounters a Russian hitman
who's looking for his abducted 12-year-old daughter.

Predictable plot, cardboard characters.
