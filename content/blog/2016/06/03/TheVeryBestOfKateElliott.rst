A collection of short stories and essays from Kate Elliott,
some of which are drawn from her various story universes.
In the foreword and the essays,
she discusses the cultural biases that
lead to the “male gaze” and male characters
being the unconsidered defaults for many readers and writers.
These stories amply demonstrate that good, interesting fantasy and SF stories
can be written with strong female characters and subtle plots.
(I already knew this; some in SF fandom still don't.)
