As I wrote `last week`_,
we had one more rehearsal to go before
our `2016 Reading`_ of *Ulysses* for Bloomsday.
That was tonight.
Mostly we worked out seating and other logistics.
We are intercutting two different chapters,
with the readers playing different roles in each chapter,
so it's a small but satisfying accomplishment
to have a seating arrangement that works for both chapters.
