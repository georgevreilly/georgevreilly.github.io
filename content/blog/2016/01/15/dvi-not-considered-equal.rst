We got a new monitor today for one of our `pairing workstations`_.
At 2560x1600, it was higher resolution than its predecessor.
I disconnected the DVI_ cable from the old monitor,
leaving it connected to one of the video ports on the computer,
and connected it to the new monitor.
All I could see was static and noise on the screen.
After trying a variety of other things,
I eventually thought to use the DVI cable that came with the new monitor.
It worked!

I had assumed that all DVI cables were interchangeable.
Reading the `Wikipedia article`_, I see that at higher resolutions,
*dual link* is needed.
I hadn't known such a thing existed.
