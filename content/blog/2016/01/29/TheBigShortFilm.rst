We saw `The Big Short`_ tonight,
which does a creditable job
of explaining the basics of the 2008 financial collapse.
It's written as a comedy-drama,
which makes it far more watchable and entertaining than a more sober documentary.
The infodumps_ are cleverly handled,
often breaking the fourth wall with `celebrity explainers`_.
The characters let their anger and outrage at Wall Street fraudulence
bleed through occasionally, as well they should.
I'm appalled that not only did no one go to jail,
but that the too-big-to-fail banks are bigger now than they ever were.

Recommended.
