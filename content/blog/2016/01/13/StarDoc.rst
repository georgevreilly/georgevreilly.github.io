Dr. Cherijo Grey Veil flees Earth to the remote planet of Kevarzanga-2,
seeking to get away from her domineering father
and the xenophobic Terrans.
She finds interesting challenges and romance
working with a variety of alien species at the FreeClinic.
Then a plague strikes that kills thousands.
When that's resolved, the news comes that her father really, really wants her back,
and is bringing enormous resources to make that happen.

I didn't like the book at first, but it grew on me as I read more of it
and I got caught up in the character and her troubles.
