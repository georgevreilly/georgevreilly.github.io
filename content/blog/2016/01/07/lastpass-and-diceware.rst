My LastPass_ browser plugin just upgraded itself to v4.0.
For several years, I've been using LastPass to manage all of my passwords.
I have literally hundreds of passwords.
I can't even remember half the sites, much less the usernames.
With LastPass, I can maintain a strong, distinct password for each site,
which is robustly encrypted and backed up in the cloud,
and I get good browser integration and adequate Android integration.
We also use LastPass at work for our individual use
and to share credentials.

There are still a handful of passwords that I have to remember and type,
including the master password for my LastPass account,
laptop passwords,
and GPG passphrases.

I've long used some cryptic passwords for those accounts,
but I'm migrating to using Diceware_ passphrases.
`The Intercept`_ explains why passphrases are a good idea.
