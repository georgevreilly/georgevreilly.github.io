Today is Martin Luther King Day,
a day that honors the legacy of a great American.
It's a Federal Holiday, but `only 37% of employers give off Martin Luther King Day`_.
Apparently, 37% is an all-time high for MLK Day
and it's also higher than the other three holidays
that most Americans don't get,
Presidents' Day, Columbus Day [sic], and Veterans' Day.

I've worked in America for a quarter century,
but it was only at the first job,
when I was a Brown University employee,
that I got those secondary Federal holidays off.

Not only is America one of the least-generous countries for vacation days,
it's also one of the least generous for holidays.
American Exceptionalismâ€”at work.
