We attended the `Sherlock Seattle Mini-Convention`_
at the Broadway Performance Hall.
It was much more lightly attended than previous
`previous Sherlock Seattle conventions`_.

The final event of the evening was
a `Mystery Science Theater`_\ –style treatment of
`Sherlock Holmes (2010 film)`_
given by some of the con's organizers.
We had seen `Young Sherlock Holmes`_ get the MST3K treatment at last year's con
and the show was quite funny.
This show was also funny,
but I was appalled at just how bad *Sherlock Holmes* was.
(I suppose that's the point of getting the MST3K treatment—\
the movie stinks and deserves to be heckled.)
It was totally incoherent and anachronistic and ineptly made.
