`Benjamin Black`_ (the mystery-writing pseudonym of Irish novelist, John Banville)
channels `Raymond Chandler`_ as he writes a `Philip Marlowe`_ novel.
Robert Parker wrote a couple of books about a quarter-century ago
with the approval of the Chandler estate.
Black's book is also authorized.

The book has all the familiar elements of a Marlowe novel:
the femme fatale of the title,
the idle rich,
ungrateful offspring and murderous staff,
cynical cops,
the baking heat of California,
beatings and booze,
Marlowe cracking wise,
and the trademark Chandleresque similes.

If you like Chandler,
you'll probably like Black's contribution to the canon.
