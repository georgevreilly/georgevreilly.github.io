The first in a series about `Sir John Fielding`_,
the blind magistrate who founded the Bow Street Runners,
London's first professional police force in 1749.
Jeremy Proctor, a newly orphaned 13-year-old, is taken under Sir John's wing
and assists him in discovering how the rakish Lord Goodhope
was murdered in a locked room.

Although I figured out the murderer halfway through,
I still enjoyed both the plot and the characters.
Alexander vividly brings Georgian London to life.
