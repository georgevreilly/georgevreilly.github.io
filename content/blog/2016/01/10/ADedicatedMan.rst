`A Dedicated Man`_ is the second novel in the `Inspector Banks`_ series.
A local historian has been murdered in the Yorkshire Dales.
He was well-liked and there seems to be no obvious motives or suspects.
Banks must dig into the dead man's past if there are no leads in the present.

Like other_ books_ in the series,
this is a competent well-written police procedural,
partly seen through Banks' eyes
and partly through the eyes of some of the locals.
Robinson is an expatriate Yorkshireman
with a fondness for his homeland and for his characters.
