I came across `Spoon Theory`_ today:

    The basic idea is that [the chronically ill] have a limited number of spoons
    available for the day and each action will cost a given number of them
    – the more demanding the task, the more spoons would be required.
    The phrase "running low on spoons" can be a useful way
    of communicating the need for rest

    — `Emily Band`_

I see this sometime with Emma:
her various illnesses and sensitivities catch up with her
and she has little capacity to get things done for a few days.
At other times, such as today,
she has quite a reasonable amount of energy or “spoons”.

I enjoy good health,
as confirmed at my annual physical today,
and I have a large number of spoons that I can draw upon.
