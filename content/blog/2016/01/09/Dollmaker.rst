Occupied France, January 1943.
Detectives Jean-Louis St-Cyr and Hermann Kohler are sent
to the German `submarine base`_ at Lorient in Brittany
to investigate a murder.
The Gross-Admiral wants a quick resolution to the case
since the prime suspect is a U-Boat captain known as the Dollmaker,
whose crew are demoralized after many months of punishing cruises
and who won't go back to sea without him.

St-Cyr and Kohler are unlikely partners,
a Chief Inspector from the Sûreté in Paris
and a longtime criminal policeman now in the Gestapo.
Both are astute investigators
but overworked and they struggle with a complex and confusing investigation
where their presence is unwelcome.
Janes_ evokes the strangeness of the Breton landscape in winter
among the ancient megaliths
and the even stranger world of the Occupation.
