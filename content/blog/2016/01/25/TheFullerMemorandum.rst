Bob Howard is a computational demonologist working for the secretive British agency
known as the “Laundry”.
Some very nasty people are trying to hasten the end of the world,
there's a mole in the Laundry,
and Bob's superior, the mysteriously ageless Angleton, is missing.
Bob moves back and forth between vicious office politics and eschatological terrors.
*The Fuller Memorandum* is fast-paced and darkly humorous.
Recommended.
