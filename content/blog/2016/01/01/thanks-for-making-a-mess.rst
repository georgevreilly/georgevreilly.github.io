Emma and I have a bargain.
If one of us cooks a nice dinner, the other cleans up.
While I can and do cook, Emma does most of the cooking.
Therefore, I do most of the cleaning.

I always thank Emma during dinner for the meal,
and Emma invariably thanks me for cleaning when I'm washing pots and pans.
I—a lifelong smartass—usually respond,
"Thank you for making a mess."

So far, she's taken this with good grace—probably better than I deserve.
In truth, the cleanup is usually far quicker than the cooking.
