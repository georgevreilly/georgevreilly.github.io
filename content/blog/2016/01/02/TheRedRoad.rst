Glasgow DI Alex Morrow is trying to put a dangerous criminal back in prison,
but she can't explain how his prints were found at the scene of a recent murder
when he was already in custody.
Fifteen years ago, when Rose Wilson was a sexually abused 14 year old,
she was responsible for two deaths in one night,
but only did time for one culpable homicide.
Now the lawyer who saved her is dead and coverups are unraveling.

In other hands, this tale of crime and corruption and disillusionment
could be unbearably squalid.
Mina's dark sense of humor and the humanity she elicits from her characters
redeem the story.
