Apparently, there's `no standard for writing dates`_ in Canada.
I assumed that Canada used the annoying US-style convention of MM/DD/YYYY.
I didn't realize that the British-style DD/MM/YYYY is also widespread.
How exasperating!

Personally, I always write YYYY-MM-DD whenever I can get away with it,
as God and `ISO 8601`_ intended.
A bill is before the Canadian parliament aiming at standardizing on year-month-day formats.
