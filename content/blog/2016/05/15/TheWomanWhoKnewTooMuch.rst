Jet Butler lives on an isolated mesa in New Mexico.
One of her few friends is a suspect in a murder.
Cordelia Morgan, an outsider,
who turns out to be far more than she seems,
is also interested in the murder,
which seems to be somehow tied up in the sale of water rights.

This never quite gelled for me.
Despite the author's flair for description,
I found the plot confusing and I was not engaged with the two protagonists.
