I saw a packet of triple chocolate cookies
and I wondered, “Triple chocolate?”.
I googled and found several recipes,
all of which used cocoa powder with
either a couple of varieties of chocolate chips,
say semisweet and white,
or a couple of varieties of chocolate,
such as dark chocolate and milk chocolate,
often melted.

The Keebler's cookie was unmemorable.
The recipes sounded better.
