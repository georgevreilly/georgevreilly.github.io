I rarely listen to `audiobooks`_, except on long driving trips.
We listened to another `Dortmunder`_ book on our drive
down to and back from Portland for PyCon.

Dortmunder's jinxed associate Andy Kelp spends a few days in jail
and reads a book called *Child Heist* by Richard Stark,
which Kelp believes to be the blueprint for a perfect crime.
Dortmunder, always wary of Kelp's schemes,
doesn't appreciate having a plan brought to him,
since he's always been the planner of the crew.
Some of the crew aren't eager to kidnap a child either,
but eventually they all come around.
Unfortunately for them, the kid is much smarter than they are,
so the perfect crime fails.

Part of the joke is that Westlake wrote a series of novels
about the ruthless career criminal `Parker`_ under the pseudonym Richard Stark.
*Child Heist* is not a real Parker novel, however.

The audiobook is very amusing with a fine performance from the narrator.

The plot was loosely inspired by the `real-life kidnapping of a Peugeot heir`_.
Apparently there's a lousy `movie adaptation`_ with Gary Coleman made in 1982,
and it was also `filmed twice more`_ in Germany and Italy.
