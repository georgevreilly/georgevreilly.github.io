We married on May 6th, 2000.
We went to Vancouver for the weekend to celebrate our sixteenth anniversary.
It was our first trip out of town since August,
when we returned from two months in Europe.
We drove up on Friday,
stopping in Marysville to have lunch with a friend
and to buy some clothes at the Outlet Mall.

On Saturday, we went up Grouse Mountain for the first time ever,
to enjoy the views on a clear day.
After that, we drove along the coast in West Vancouver
as far as the scenic village at Horseshoe Bay
and the Whytecliff Park.
We concluded the day with a fine dinner at Adesso.

On Sunday, Emma wasn't feeling well.
We spent some time at the Nitobe Garden on the UBC Grounds,
then made our meandering way home.
