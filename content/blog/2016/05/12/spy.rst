Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy),
a self-effacing, overweight, desk-bound CIA mission controller,
spends her days in a verminous CIA basement
talking into the earpiece of her glamorous field agent counterpart.
When he's killed before her remote eyes and other field agents are compromised,
she goes into the field for the first time
and soon blossoms into a deadly agent.

I had never seen McCarthy in anything before and
I assumed that Spy_ would be a dumb, gross-out comedy.
It was better than I feared
and genuinely funny at times.
McCarthy inhabits several personas,
ranging from the initial doormat of an analyst
through her cover as a guileless midwestern tourist
to her assumed cover as a hard-as-nails bodyguard,
and she is funny and occasionally touching.
Her performance is better than the script,
which, while amusing, is lazy and clichéd.
