`Ant-Man`_ is a lightweight but appealing entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Decades ago, Hank Pym discovered the Pym Particle and invented the Ant-Man suit,
which allowed him to shrink to the size of an ant.
He buries the technology, believing it's too dangerous.
Now his former protégé Darren Cross is close
to perfecting the Yellowjacket shrinking suit and selling it to Hydra.
Pym and his daughter Hope recruit Scott Lang,
a former burglar, to don the Ant-Man suit to stop Cross.

Much of the movie is played for laughs.
Unlike Deadpool_, these are PG-13 laughs.
Paul Rudd is charming and amusing in the lead role.
The plot is serviceable, but hardly original.
