GFCI FTW!
`Ground-Fault Circuit Interrupters`_ For The Win.
Last week, while trimming the hedge,
I managed to partially sever the extension cord.
The GFCI kicked in so quickly that I didn't even realize that I had cut the cord
before it stopped working.

As a child growing up in Ireland,
I was quite accustomed to `replacing electrical plugs`_.
Many electrical devices are sold in Britain and Ireland with two-pin plugs.
Unlike US two-pin plugs,
the British two-pin plugs will *not* fit into a three-pin outlet
unless you use an adapter.
Many people would cut off the two-pin plug and wire up a three-pin plug instead.

I've never seen this done in the USâ€”\
no doubt because a US two-pin plug works in a three-pin outlet.
Nevertheless, I think I'll try shortening the extension cord
so that I can salvage_ it.
