Two transitions at Freely Speaking Toastmasters tonight:
Kim gave her last speech before moving to California
and Shasti gave her tenth speech,
which earned her her `Competent Communicator`_ award.

It's always exciting to see people proceed through a series of speeches
and achieve milestones like the CC.
You see them get better with each speech.
The awkward fumbling hesitation of the early speeches
is supplanted by growing fluidity and confidence,
as the practice and the evaluations help them improve.
