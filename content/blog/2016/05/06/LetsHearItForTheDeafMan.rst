It's Spring and crime is heating up in the `87th Precinct`_.
A hippie has been found crucified,
a cat burglar is leaving kittens at the scene of the crime,
and the Deaf Man is taunting the detectives again,
sending them clues of his upcoming crime.
We see blackly humorous slices of life in the big city
as the cops work their cases.
