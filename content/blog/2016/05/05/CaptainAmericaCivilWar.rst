| Title: Captain America: Civil War
| Directors: Anthony & Joe Russo
| Rating: ★ ★ ★ ★ 
| Released: 2016

The United Nations wants to rein in the Avengers,
after the huge damage due to their various battles,
notably in `Avengers\: Age of Ultron`_.
Tony Stark (Iron Man) is feeling guilty about the deaths they've caused
and wants to go along.
Steve Rogers (Captain America) has grown distrustful of government agendas
and doesn't want to sign the Sokovia Accords.
When his old comrade, Bucky Barnes (the Winter Soldier), is framed for a terrorist attack,
Rogers and some friends end up outside the law
and Stark and others try to stop them.

This is an exciting and entertaining addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe,
posing an interesting moral dilemma for the lead characters.
While a “civil war” does require a number of characters on each side,
the sheer number of superheroes in play felt bloated
and the implied pitches for upcoming MCU movies grew tiresome.
Even so, I enjoyed it.
