`Spy Sinker`_,
although it was written after `Spy Hook`_ and `Spy Line`_
as well as the previous *Berlin Game*, *Mexico Set*, *London Match* trilogy,
tells the parallel story of how Fiona Samson
came to be one of MI6's most effective double agents
without her husband Bernard's knowledge.
Told from the perspectives of Fiona and of her case runner, Bret Rensselaer,
we see her under increasing strain as the date of her “defection” to East Germany draws near,
which is compounded once she's alone in East Berlin.
She never quite cracks but we see the lasting damage of the deception.

Recommended.
