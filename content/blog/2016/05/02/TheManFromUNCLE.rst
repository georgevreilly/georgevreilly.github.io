`The Man from U.N.C.L.E.`_ is a moderately entertaining action comedy
set in the cold war,
postulating a somewhat unlikely alliance
between CIA agent Napoleon Solo and KGB operative Ilya Kuryakin,
who team up to prevent a nuclear weapon falling into ex-Nazi hands.
It's also the wholly unnecessary remake of the classic 1960s TV show.

There's decent chemistry between the three stars,
Henry Cavill (Solo), Armie Hammer (Kuryakin), and Alicia Vikander (scientist's daughter),
and the glamorous early 1960s are lovingly recreated.
The plot, alas, is uninspired and unoriginal and falls rather flat.

Watchable.
