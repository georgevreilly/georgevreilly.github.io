We drove down to Portland, Oregon yesterday for PyCon_.
No trip to Portland would be complete without a trip to `Powell's bookstore`_.
I don't have much time this trip, but we did manage to spend an hour there last night,
before they closed at 11pm.
There's nothing like it in Seattle.
I like Elliott Bay Bookstore but it's a pale shadow of Powell's.
A long time ago, someone described Powell's to me as “the best bookstore in Seattle”—\
meaning that Seattleites who want to visit a world-class bookstore
have to visit Portland.

I got out lightly.
I spent only $85.
