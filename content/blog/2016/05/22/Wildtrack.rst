Nick Sandman earned a Victoria Cross in the Falklands
and spent a year relearning how to walk.
Now all he wants to do is to restore *Sycorax*, his beloved old boat.
But to afford that, he has to work for TV star Tony Bannister.
Bannister wants to win the `St Pierre–Halifax race`_ with Sandman's help
and he wants to make a documentary about Sandman,
neither of which Sandman wants.
Bannister's wife died sailing the previous year
and her wealthy father holds Bannister responsible.

Another of Cornwell's contemporary `sailing thrillers`_,
which also holds up well 30 years later.
