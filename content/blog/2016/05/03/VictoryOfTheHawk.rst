After the `Vengeance of the Hunter`_,
the Anreulag, the creature known as the Voice of the Gods, has gone rogue,
waging war on the Adalonian empire that controlled her for centuries.
The Order of the Hawks have found the long-hidden stronghold of the elves.
The humans of Nivirry and the elves are throwing off the shackles of Adalonia,
but the Anreulag has no regard for anyone's lives, human or elf.
Faanshi, Julian, and Kestar may be able to stop her
but it won't be easy.

A satisfying conclusion to the trilogy,
as the three protagonists rise to their destinies.
The Anreulag, though monstrous,
earns the sympathy of Faanshi and Kestar and of the reader.
The characters, major and minor, are well-drawn.
The plot reaches a resolution,
but there's potential for other tales in this upturned world.

Recommended.
