`What We Do In The Shadows`_ is a mockumentary
about four vampires living in the suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand.
They are being filmed by a documentary crew in the months running up
to the Unholy Masquerade Ball,
the highlight of the social season
for the local vampires, witches, and zombies.
Not well adapted to modern life,
Viago, Vladislav, and Deacon are all hundreds of years old.
8,000-year-old Petyr turns a new vampire, Nick,
who brings his human friend, Stu, a computer programmer,
into their circle.
Stu—who the older vampires like better than Nick—\
brings them up to speed with the twenty-first century.
And then Stu runs into a pack of werewolves during a full moon.

*What We Do In The Shadows* is droll and charming,
expertly spoofing vampire clichés,
while maintaining the pseudo–\ *cinema verité* traditions of mockumentaries
in following a group of earnest misfits.

Recommended.
