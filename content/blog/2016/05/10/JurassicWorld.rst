`Jurassic World`_ is an unnecessary retread of the Jurassic Park franchise.
New, scarier, smarter monster Imperator Furiosa¹
breaks out of its enclosure and wreaks havoc,
killing humans and dinosaurs for pleasure.
Plucky kids—or are they darn, meddling kids?—\
aided by unlikely romantic couple\
—\ *and* by velociraptors and a T. Rex—\
manage to save the day.
Meanwhile, greedy human villains plan to profit off the mess
but get eaten before the end to audience applause.
Chris Pratt delivers scruffy heroics
while Bryce Dallas Howard runs around the entire movie
in ridiculous heels without breaking either an ankle or a heel.

¹ Sorry, `wrong movie`_. Actually, “Indominus.”
