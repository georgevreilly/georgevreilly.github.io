Pinkerton agent Frederick Chase arrives at Reichenbach Falls
just after Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty have plunged to their deaths.
With Inspector Athelney Jones of Scotland Yard—\
surely one of Holmes's most ardent students—\
he travels to London on the trail of an American master criminal, Clarence Devereaux.
Devereaux's gang is moving quickly and ruthlessly
to seize control of the vacuum left by Moriarty.
But not all is it appears and the American gang receive bloody setbacks.
Could Moriarty be alive after all?

While I mostly enjoyed the book, I was exasperated by the ending,
which I will not spoil.
