I got a new MacBook Pro on Monday:
a 13" Retina with 16GB RAM and 500GB SSD,
which doubles both the RAM and the disk capacity
of its late-2013 predecessor.
8GB wasn't really enough for software development.
By the time you run Chrome and PyCharm and Docker,
you don't have much RAM left.
And I was constantly having to run `Grand Perspective`_
to clean up disk space.

For the first time, I used the `Migration Assistant`_ and a Thunderbolt cable
to transfer settings from the old laptop to the new.
I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.
In one hour, the new machine had all the files and just about all the settings.
I did have to swap the Cmd and Option keys on my `external keyboard`_
and reconfigure the Display settings for the external monitor,
but that's about it.
I also had to update to OS X 10.11.4,
which I had previously done on the old laptop.
