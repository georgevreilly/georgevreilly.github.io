A disparate group of necromancer hunters and artists are trekking through the desert.
They're out of food and the artists must compete not to be eaten by the strongmen
by telling stories by the campfire.
It's the Canterbury Tales crossed with Scheherazade.
The narrator shows how he skillfully and shamelessly manipulated the various parties.
His stories within stories sow doubt and dissension.
There's black humor and art criticism and enough suspense to keep you going,
once you get past the interminable beginning.
