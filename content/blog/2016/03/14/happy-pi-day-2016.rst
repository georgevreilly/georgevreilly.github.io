3/14 is considered to be `Pi Day`_ by many geeks, as `π`_ is approximately 3.14.
I wish I could say that I had celebrated by eating pie,
but I didn't.

π is surely the most important irrational number,
which has been known since antiquity.

π shows up in so many different formulas.
My own favorite is `Euler's Identity`_,
:math:`e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0`.
(This marks the first use of the `reStructuredText math role`_ in my blog.)

I am also find of the approximate fraction :math:`355/113`.

The `Wikipedia article on π`_ has much more on π.
