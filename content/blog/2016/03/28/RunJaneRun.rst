Sequel to `A.K.A. Jane`_.

Jane Nichols' parents were murdered in front of her on a Greek hillside
when she was six.
An MI5 operation triggers some dormant memories
and she starts to suspect who was responsible.
An attempt on her life confirms that she's not imagining it.
She returns to her life in Savannah to lay a trap.

Another entertaining entry in the Jane series.
The last, presumably, since it's nearly 20 years old.
