`Mother London`_ is well written and it has some fine scenes and three interesting characters.
I wanted to like it but it never engaged me
because the story goes nowhere.
I rarely abandon books, but I gave up on this two-thirds of the way through.

*Mother London* follows three outpatients from a mental hospital,
between 1940 and the 1980s:
Josef Kiss, a larger-than-life performer,
David Mummery, a writer,
and Mary Gasalee, a housewife who spends fifteen years in a coma, after the Blitz.
All three seem to be psychically sensitive to the thoughts of others.
The narrative hopscotches back and forth across the decades
London itself is the fourth character,
lovingly described in many guises.
