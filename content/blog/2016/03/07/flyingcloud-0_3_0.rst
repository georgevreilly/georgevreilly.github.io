I just announced_ the release of FlyingCloud 0.3.0
on the ``flyingcloud-users`` mailing list.
I'll have more to say about FlyingCloud in future.
For now, let's just say it's a tool that we use to build
`Docker <http://docker.com>`_ images using masterless `SaltStack <http://saltstack.com/>`_.

I'll be speaking about FlyingCloud at `Wednesday's PuPPy meetup`_.
