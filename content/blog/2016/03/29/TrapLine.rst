The drug smugglers who bring their merchandise in through the Florida Keys
need some local expertise and decide that Breeze Albury is their man.
Although he has no desire to be involved,
they force him to take part.
When they need a convenient fall guy and set him up,
he turns on The Machine and on the corrupt local cops.
Revenge is sweet.

Although it's set in Florida,
this early Hiaasen novel lacks the humor of his more famous books.
Still, Breeze is an engaging character and the plot moves along nicely.
