Advertising would make you think that acne is a problem only for teenagers.
Not true.
It's never entirely gone away for me.
I often find spots on my nose.
Less often, on my chin or forehead.
I've even had a few spots inside my ears.

For some reason, I woke up with three spots this morning:
on the side of my nose;
under my jawline, hidden by my beard;
and on the back of my neck, near the hairline.
Go figure.
