New private investigator Sam Ireland
is hired to track down a gangster-turned-memoirist.
She can't find him, but she's not the only one looking.
His lethal nephew also wants to find him, after dealing with two hit men.
All of this searching is drawing unwelcome attention to long-held secrets,
and more blood will be shed.

A darkly amusing, frenetic tour through Glasgow's underbelly.
