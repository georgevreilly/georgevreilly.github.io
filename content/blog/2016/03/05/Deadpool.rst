Deadpool_ is the role that Ryan Reynolds was born to play,
the "Merc with a Mouth" anti-hero
who breaks the fourth wall and breaks heads with equal facility.
It's very funny, very twisted, and very violent,
and it fully deserves its R rating.

Wade Wilson, a former mercenary, has terminal cancer.
He undergoes a treatment that
not only cures his cancer and renders him capable of regenerating quickly from any wound,
but leaves him horribly scarred.
The treatment was actually intended to turn him into a super slave.
Wanting both revenge and a cure for his disfigurement,
he suits up and tracks down his former captors,
leaving dozens of dead henchmen in his wake.

As violent action comedies go,
it's one of the better ones.
