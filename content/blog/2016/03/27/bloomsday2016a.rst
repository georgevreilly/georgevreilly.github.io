Bloomsday is less than three months away
and the `Wild Geese Players`_ need to start rehearsing soon.
I made a start on the script at the end of January,
but didn't pick it up again until today.

Three years ago, we completed *Ulysses*, having started in 1998.
Two years ago, we started over,
reading chapters 1 and 4 interleaved.
In Chapter 1 (Telemachus), Stephen Dedalus arises in the Martello Tower at Sandymount
and feuds with Buck Mulligan.
Chapter 4 (Calypso) takes place at the same time as Chapter 1,
wherein Leopold Bloom breaks his fast.

Last year, we intertwined chapters 2 and 5.
Chapter 2 (Nestor) takes place at the school where Stephen teaches;
he locks horns with Deasy, the headmaster.
Chapter 5 (The Lotus Eaters) sees Bloom ambling through Dublin,
picking up the illicit letter from his would-be mistress, Martha.

This year, we're going to intertwine chapters 3 and 6.
Stephen wanders along Sandymount strand in Chapter 3 (Proteus),
lost in his thoughts.
While in Chapter 6 (Hades),
Bloom travels in a carriage with Simon Dedalus, Martin Cunningham, and Mr Power
to Paddy Dignam's funeral at Glasnevin cemetery.

I dislike Chapter 3, as I find it nearly unreadable.
Stephen disappears up his own arsehole with his philosphical musings.
I'm bitter because that's where I gave up the first time that I read *Ulysses*,
back in 1982 during the Joyce centenary.
If I had known to skip the rest of that chapter
and start reading Calypso,
I might have finished the book twenty years sooner than I did.

I have yet to figure out how to carve up chapters 3 and 6 for interleaving.
Otherwise, I've mostly prepared the first draft.
I took the source from `Project Gutenberg`_,
converted it into LaTeX,
added attributions for the speakers, narrators, and internal monologues,
added the Gabler edition line numbers,
and otherwise cleaned it up.
