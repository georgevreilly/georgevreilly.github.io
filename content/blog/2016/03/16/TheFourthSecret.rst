A quirky novella about `Commissario Montalbano`_ of the Italian Polizia.
A series of “accidents” have been happening at construction sites.
Montalbano receives an anonymous letter warning that another “accident” will happen,
too late to prevent it.
He attempts to cover it up, while still investigating,
and realizes that he's infringing on the `caribinieri`_'s jurisdiction, a no-no.

Moderately entertaining.
