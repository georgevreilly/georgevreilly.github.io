Three people are nearly all that's left of the elite “Meshed” caste.
They stay one step aside of the hunters
and live off the proceeds from making and selling the highly addictive “Staze”.
They flee to a long-abandoned planet and discover a new lifeform,
which takes over in both meatspace and the shared virtual reality,
infecting the dreams of the Staze-addicted.

While there were some interesting ideas in this book,
I didn't enjoy it very much.
