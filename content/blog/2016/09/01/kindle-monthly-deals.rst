Every month, Amazon offers hundreds of Kindle ebooks at `$3.99 or less`__.
As well as the dross, there are always a number of books that are great value at such a price.
I just bought several from the September crop, including
`Bloodchild`_ (Octavia Butler),
`The Confessions of Nat Turner`_ (William Styron),
`Magic Bitter, Magic Sweet`_ (Charlie Holmberg),
`Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence`_ (Doris Pilkington),
and
`Schismatrix Plus`_ (Bruce Sterling).
