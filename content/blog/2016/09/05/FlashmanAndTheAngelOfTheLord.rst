`Flashman and the Angel of the Lord`__ finds Flashy back in America
where everybody wants him to be the aide-de-camp to the abolitionist `John Brown`__,
who's plotting a raid__ on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry.
The Underground Railroad want him to help Brown to start a slave rebellion;
Kuklos (a proto KKK) want Brown to start a civil war to cause disunion;
and finally the secret service want Flashman to sabotage Brown so as to avoid a civil war.
Flashman is left with no choice but to spend a few months undercover with Brown
with a Kuklos spy at his side to keep him from running.
The raid is unsuccessful, Brown is tried for treason,
becomes a martyr for abolition in the dock, and is executed.

Fraser points his keen historical gaze towards the leadup to the Civil War
and paints a half-admiring portrait of John Brown.
Entertaining but not one of the better Flashman novels.
