The “Butcher” is leaving dismembered corpses of women all over New York City
and he seems to want to get Frank Quinn's goat.
Quinn is a former police captain, who's been called back from retirement
along with two of his former team members,
Pearl, his ex-girlfriend, and the slovenly Fedderman.
The “Butcher” is brilliant and the body count is climbing.

While the book is properly suspenseful,
I couldn't suspend my disbelief at the notion
that the NYPD would have little more than Quinn's tiny team
working on such a major case.
Of the main characters, I found Pearl the most interesting: prickly and human.
Quinn is something of a superhuman cypher, except where his teenaged daughter is concerned.
And the Butcher was too good (bad?) to be true.
