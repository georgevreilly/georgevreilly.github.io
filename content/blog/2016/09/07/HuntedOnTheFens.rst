DI Nikki Galena and her team have been targeted by someone with a vicious grudge.
One copper is dead, another is badly injured,
Galena has been hounded out of her home,
and civilians have been hurt too.
The cops have no idea who's behind it.

The story is overwrought but the characterization was good
and the story was entertaining.
