I assembled a couple of adjustable shelving units today.
Trying to count the same number of indentations on all four legs for each level
quickly grew tedious, and I realized that I needed to make a story stick.
I cut a "stick" to the right length
and then I was able to place the stick along the leg
and instantly read where the next pair of snap rings should be placed.
I mentioned this to Emma and she had never heard of story sticks.

Woodworkers have used `story sticks`_ for a long time
to build furniture and to get reproducible results.
Instead of writing down a measurement on a sheet of paper
and later using a tape measure to cut something to that length,
the measurement is instead marked on a stick
and *transferred* to the new piece of wood.
It's less error prone, especially if the actual measurement
is slightly off from the prescribed measurement.
A story stick often has several marks,
describing different aspects of the piece being built.
