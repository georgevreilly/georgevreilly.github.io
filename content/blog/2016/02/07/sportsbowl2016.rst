I half-watched team sports *twice* today.
We got up early to go to an Irish friend's house,
to eat a full Irish breakfast and watch rugby.
I no longer detest rugby with the virulence that I had growing up,
when I attended a rugby-playing school in Dublin from ages 7 to 18,
but I'm still not interested in the game.

This afternoon, I went to a Chinese New Year's party,
which doubled as a Superbowl party.
I transferred my feelings about rugby to American football when I moved here.
I have many problems with football culture:
the worship of jocks, `rape culture`_, homophobia, concussion.
Even if all of those could be fixed,
the game itself is interminable to watch,
worse even than baseball or cricket.
In rugby, they play two 40-minute halves;
they do not stop the clock every 30 seconds.
