The Coen Brothers' latest movie, `Hail, Caesar!`_, is a lot of fun.
I've been looking forward to it since the trailers showed up a few months ago.
It's a homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood,
an age where quirky talents like the Coens
could not have made Coen Brothers' movies.
We see song and dance numbers, synchronized swimming,
singing cowboys, and ballroom dramas.
Most of all, we see a big-budget swords-and-sandals epic,
whose star, Baird Whitlock, has been kidnapped by The Future,
a group of Communist screenwriters,
and is being held for $100,000 ransom.
Eddie Mannix is the studio fixer who has to wrangle
the studio's stars and keep them out of the gossip columns.
It's one big headache but it's his calling.
