Ten years ago, Rommy "Squirrel" Gandolph—\
generally regarded as a harmless thief not playing with a full deck—\
confessed to three murders.
Now he's about to be executed
and Arthur Raven, his court-appointed attorney,
believes his protestations of innocence.
The book follows Arthur,
who finds an ally in Gillian Sullivan,
the disgraced ex-judge who presided over Gandolph's trial,
and the prosecutor, Muriel Wynn, and the detective, Larry Starczek.

Turow digs deep into the characters of his four protagonists,
as they struggle with each other and with the revelations of the case.
They are all flawed, scarred individuals,
most notably Gillian who still conceals that she had been a heroin addict.
While Arthur and Gillian have come to believe that Gandolph is innocent,
Larry and Muriel still believe in his guilt,
even when a dying convict claims to have framed him.
Not only are the characters interesting but the plot draws you in too.

Recommended.
