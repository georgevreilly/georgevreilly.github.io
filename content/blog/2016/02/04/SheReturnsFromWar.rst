In this sequel to `The Dead of Winter`_,
a young lady called Victoria Dawes travels from England to Albuquerque
to seek the aid of Cora Oglesby, the now-retired monster hunter.
The women draw the attention of a Navajo skinwalker and a vampire,
and they spend the book dueling each other.
Under Cora's sarcastic tough love tutelage,
Miss Dawes grows from a sheltered Victorian lady into a semi-capable fighter.

The interaction of the two main characters was fairly entertaining,
not wholly preposterous, and certainly passed the `Bechdel test`_.
