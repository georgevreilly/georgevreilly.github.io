Recently married, Lord Peter Wimsey and the former Harriet Vane
take up residence at their townhouse.
When the beautiful wife of an acquaintance is murdered,
Peter becomes involved in the investigation.
Meanwhile, Harriet is coming to terms with having "married up",
after fending off Peter's wooing for several years.
Should she continue her career as a mystery novelist,
now that she no longer needs the income,
or do what is expected by some: have babies and give up writing.
All of this is against the backdrop of the nation mourning the death of George V
and of the brief reign of `Edward VIII`_, who is soon to abdicate.

Sayers wrote the first few chapters of `Thrones, Dominations`_ in 1936,
but never completed it.
Sixty years later, Paton Walsh was asked by Sayers' estate to complete it.
She does a fine job of channeling Sayers' much-loved characters.
The plot is unexceptional.
The subplot of the new king's dalliance with a divorcée and with Nazi sympathizers
would not have been written by Sayers in 1936.

Precedes `A Presumption of Death`_, which I enjoyed a little more.
