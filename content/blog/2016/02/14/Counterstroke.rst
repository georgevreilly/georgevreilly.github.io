The wife of a rich politician has been kidnapped by terrorists
who want to exchange her in nine days' time
for one of their number who's in prison.
Actor Bob Farran thinks he can impersonate Tom Lacey well enough
that Sally Morland will be freed and he can earn the £250,000 reward.

We spend three quarters of the book preparing for the impersonation,
which gives Farran time to do it well.
While the nine-day delay enabled the impersonation,
it makes little sense for the terrorists to have asked for such a delay.
The exchange and the aftermath were rather anticlimactic.
