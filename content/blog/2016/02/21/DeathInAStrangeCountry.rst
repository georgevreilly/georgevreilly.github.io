A body has washed up in the canals of Venice,
that of an American soldier from the nearby US base at Vicenza.
Commissario Guido Brunetti doesn't believe that it's a mugging gone wrong,
especially when he sees the fear in the eyes
of the female army doctor who's sent to identify the body.
He digs and finds corruption among the rich and powerful, in a toxic coverup.

Brunetti is a decent and honorable family man,
whose sense of justice is undiminished by working for
an incompetent functionary in a broken system.
