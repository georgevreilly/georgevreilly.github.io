I visited a `faux-Irish bar`_ this evening
where both three-leaved and four-leaved shamrocks were found in abundance.

The reason why shamrocks_ are associated with Ireland
is that our patron saint, St. Patrick,
used the three-leaved plant
as a metaphor for the Divine Trinity,
the three gods in one,
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.
(The Irish usually refer to the Holy Spirit as the Holy Ghost.
I spent ages 7â€“18 at `St. Mary's College CSSp`_ in Dublin,
which is run by the Holy Ghost Fathers.)

A `four-leaf clover`_ is considered lucky because it is rare.
It may be lucky but it is not a shamrock.
