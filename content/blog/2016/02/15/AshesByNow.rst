Nick Sharman is a washed up London PI,
living with two strippers and drinking himself into oblivion.
He used to be a promising Detective Constable,
and a bad case from that time comes back to haunt him.
The teenaged daughter of an inspector died after being raped twelve years ago.
His sergeant fitted up a local flasher and Sharman reluctantly went along.
Now Sailor Grant is out and wants to clear his name.
Sharman refuses to get involved; Grant is murdered;
and Sharman's former sergeant beats him half to death.
Sharman recovers and finds a web of police corruption.

The plot is tight and the characters are interesting.
Recommended.
