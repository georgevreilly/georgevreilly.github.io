We saw `Mad Max: Fury Road`_ at the Cinerama tonight,
as part of its `Eight Days of Oscar`_\ â€”\
*Fury Road* having being nominated for ten Oscars,
including Best Picture and Best Director.
I have no idea if it will win any awards from the Academy,
but it's no ordinary action movie.

Action there is aplenty,
a kinetic feast of racing cars and roaring maniacs 
that rarely lets up.
Imperator Furiosa and Max flee across the desert,
taking Immortan Joe's five nubile wives to a better place.
They seek hope, Furiosa seeks redemption, and Max seeks mostly to survive.
Furiosa sets the plot in motion;
Max is a loner battered by fate,
grudgingly coming to the women's aid.
Furiosa is the true hero here,
though Max proves himself a hero in time.
