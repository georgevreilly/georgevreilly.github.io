Emma is once again at the `Madrona Fiber Arts Festival`_ in Tacoma.
It's a convention of knitters, crocheters,
and practitioners of other fiber arts,
and Emma goes every year.
She takes classes and hangs out with her fellow knitters.
It's always held over Valentine's Day Weekend,
so I tease her about preferring knitting to romantic dinners with me.
