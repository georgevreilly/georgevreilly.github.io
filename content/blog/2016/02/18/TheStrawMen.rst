London, January 1381.
`John of Gaunt`_'s regency is in trouble,
unrest abounds throughout the land,
and uprisings are being plotted.
Brother Athelstan and his friend the Coroner
are invited to a performance by Gaunt's players, the Straw Men,
at the Tower of London.
When a murder occurs during the play, Athelstan is required to investigate.
Several more murders happen before he finds the culprit.

Doherty pulls off both an intricate plot and a satisfying historical novel.
