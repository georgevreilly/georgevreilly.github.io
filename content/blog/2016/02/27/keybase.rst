I was sent an invite to `Keybase`_ a few weeks, which I accepted tonight.

`Keybase Wants To Make Serious Encryption Accessible To Mere Mortals`_
explains:

    From a cryptographic standpoint, PGP is rock solid.
    In practice, using it is very messy.
    Its complexity has deterred the vast majority of people
    who might otherwise benefit from using encryption.

    The first problem is establishing a valid identity,
    especially with other people located oceans away.
    The second is distributing public keys
    without nefarious types posting alternative keys
    that appear to be registered to the same person.
    ...
    The third issue is getting people to install and use PGP software.

I can now be reached via https://keybase.io/georgevreilly.
I've proved my identity on
`GeorgeVReilly.com`_, `GitHub`_, `Twitter`_,
`Reddit`_, and `Hacker News`_.
