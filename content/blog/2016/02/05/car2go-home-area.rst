I've driven Car2go a couple of times this week.
On both occasions, while driving through downtown Seattle,
the car announced that I was outside its home area.
Presumably it temporarily lost a signal
and thereby assumed that it was no longer in the home area.
Given the car knew my position and direction just moments before,
and that I was well inside the home area,
any half-way decent algorithm would have concluded
that it was physically impossible for me to be now outside the home area,
and kept its mouth shut.
