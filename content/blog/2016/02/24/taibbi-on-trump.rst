In a new article for Rolling Stone, `Matt Taibbi excoriates Trump`_:

    It turns out we let our electoral process
    devolve into something so fake and dysfunctional
    that any half-bright con man
    with the stones to try it
    could walk right through the front door
    and tear it to shreds on the first go.

    And Trump is no half-bright con man, either.
    He's way better than average.

Both Trump and Cruz scare me, for very different reasons.
Trump is impulsive, all id, doesn't give a fuck,
riling up the worst impulses of the American electorate for short-term gain.
Who knows what this loose cannon will do?
Cruz is a nasty piece of work,
cold and calculating,
a hard-right conservative and a `Dominionist`_,
`widely hated`_ by those who've worked with him.
They're both very dangerous
and I do not look forward to either of them winning the Presidency.

I favor Bernie Sanders but I will throw my support behind Hillary Clinton,
should she win the Democratic nomination.
