Cora Oglesby and her husband Ben have been slaying monsters
and slinging guns all over the Old West for years,
ever since the Civil War ended.
In a bitterly cold winter,
on the outskirts of a silver-mining town in Colorado,
they take down a wendigo_ and then a nest of vampires.

Cora is tough and hardened and takes no crap from anyone, man or monster.
But she's damaged too, more than we realize at first.
I thought the first-time author did a decent job
of writing a paranormal Western:
the tale moved along and Cora was an engaging character.
However, I can't accept that the central plot twist
would have gone unnoticed for ten whole years.
The dialogue of the Western characters sounded about right,
but the speech of the two English gentlemen did not.
