My mid-2012 15" MacBook Pro has been getting ever slower.
My last two work laptops came with SSDs, but this older machine has a 768GB hard disk drive.
It was time to get a solid-state drive, which are far more affordable now than four years ago.
Rather than replace the HDD, I bought a `Data Doubler`_ kit and a 480GB SSD.
I removed the optical drive and installed the Data Doubler with SSD in that space.
I rarely used the DVD drive, so I won't miss it.

The Data Doubler kit came with a set of screwdrivers and
a detailed manual that covered multiple MacBook models.
The manual had combined instructions for both the 2011 and 2012 15" MacBook Pros,
which weren't quite right for the mid-2012 model.
The `iFixIt`_ instructions cleared up my confusion
regarding the camera cable connector.
That aside, it went flawlessly.

I used `Disk Utility`_ to format the new drive as HFS+.
I had previously made a `bootable USB thumbdrive`_ of OS X 10.11.
I booted from the thumbdrive by holding down `Option ⌥`_ as the laptop turned on.
I installed a clean copy of OS X on the new SSD drive,
leaving the original HDD untouched.

I'm still setting up the new installation,
but the laptop does seem much more responsive than before.
