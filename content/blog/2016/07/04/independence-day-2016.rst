I have an ambivalent relation to the notion of patriotism
because all too often those who most loudly proclaim themselves to be patriots
are the worst sort of jingoistic, know-nothing, blowhardsâ€”\
be they Trump supporters, Brexiters, or Irish nationalists.

And yet, for all the flaws and failures of the American Experiment,
there are still things to celebrate.
America's optimism and can-do spirit,
although much abraded in recent years, is still exemplary.
Millions continue to flock here, drawn to the land of opportunity.
The Founding Fathers created a great and lasting democracy,
albeit with a franchise and a set of rights that had to be widened several times.
The world can't get enough of America's technology and movies and clothes.

Let me close with John Cena's video, `We are America`_.

Happy 240th birthday, United States of America!
