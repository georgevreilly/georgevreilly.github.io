    :alt: 109F in Topanga Canyon, Los Angeles

We're in Los Angeles for the weekend to attend a wedding and it's scorchingly hot.
I took this photo of the car's dashboard while we were at a stop light in Topanga Canyon.
It reads 109°F (43°C).
I actually saw the temperature briefly reach 111°F.
I've experienced the low hundreds before, but I don't think I've ever felt 109°F.

June was the `14th consecutive month of record-breaking global temperatures`__.
Even Ireland is getting in on the act,
with temperatures `soaring to 30°C (86°F)`__ the other day.
