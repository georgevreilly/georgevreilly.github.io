1018AD. King Cnut of Denmark (aka Canute__) has recently conquered England,
and now must broker peace between the Saxons and the Danes at Oxford.
Also in Oxford are Winston, a talented illuminator of manuscripts,
and Halfdan, a roguish half-Danish half-Saxon landless noble.
A prominent Saxon has been murdered and Cnut commands Winston and Halfdan to investigate.

While the mystery was reasonably while done,
I found the anachronistic speech patterns quite jarring.
The book is translated from Danish;
I presume this is also true in the original.
