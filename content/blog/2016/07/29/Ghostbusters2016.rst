The `Ghostbusters`_ remake is a lightweight but enjoyable summer comedy and a lot of fun.
Four women, mostly discredited scientists, fight an increasing number of paranormal incursions
and kick some ass—without wearing skintight clothing or being adjuncts to male leads.
Internet trolls may be outraged but the non-traditional casting works.
Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones are funny and jell together.
And Chris Hemsworth as the hunky but dim receptionist is an amusing bit of reverse casting,
while Kate McKinnon seems to have become a `queer icon`__ overnight.

I dislike Hollywood's lazy and cowardly preference for remakes and reboots,
but this one is successful,
paying homage to the original but also being a fresh take.
