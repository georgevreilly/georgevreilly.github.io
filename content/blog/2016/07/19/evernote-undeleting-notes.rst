I accidentally deleted a note that I shouldn't have in Evernote.
It wasn't obvious how to undelete it.
I had to resort to the `help`__:

* Open *Notebooks*
* Scroll all the way to the *bottom*
* Open the *Trash* notebook, which is unlabeled in the Mac desktop version of Evernote
* Restore the deleted Note
