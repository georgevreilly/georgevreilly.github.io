Abigail has gone missing from creepy Blackwater Farm days before her tenth birthday.
Her twin Olivia has been mute ever since.
Their strange mother is not helping matters and the father is acting oddly too.
DC Jennifer Knight, who belongs to a secret psychic police task force,
is the family liaison officer.
She must convince Olivia to break her silence and reveal what she knows
before time runs out for Abigail.

This was a reasonably good thriller that I think would have been better
without the supernatural elements.
