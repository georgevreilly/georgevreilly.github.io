`Star Trek Beyond`_ is the best of the `Kelvin timeline`__ Trek movies,
easily surpassing the two previous episodes in the reboot.

The *Enterprise* is lured into an ambush where the ship is destroyed by Krall,
a megalomaniac who has a grudge against the Federation.
Most of the crew are captured,
leaving only a few of the officers at large to run around frenetically.
They find an ancient Federation ship, free the crew,
and stop Krall before he can destroy a giant starbase.

I thought that this was the best of the three Kelvin movies
and the closest to the feel of the original series.
The camaraderie between the crew is good,
but it takes second place to the incessant action.
*Trek* is about ideas and discovering brave new worlds,
and that got short shrift against the need to keep the audience's adrenaline pumping.
