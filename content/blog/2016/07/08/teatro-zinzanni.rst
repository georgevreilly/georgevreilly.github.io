Teatro Zinzanni is a long-running circus dinner theater in Seattle.
Six of us went tonight and enjoyed
a blend of cabaret, circus arts, fine dining, and vaudeville.

The current show, Hotel L'Amour, is ostensibly set in a fine hotel,
where the octogenarian Madame reminisces about her career,
while Caesar the lounge lizard hams it up,
Maestro Voronin brings a puppet girl to life,
one aerialist cavorts around an enormous martini glass,
a juggler dazzles with his versatility,
another aerialist works the straps,
and the soprano trills.
All this while the audience eats a fairly decent meal spread out over three hours.

'Twas enjoyable to be sure and the acts were good
but it was hard to hear each other once the show started,
as the sound never let up.
