DI John Rebus_ is struggling with an incipient gang war in Edinburgh.
He's investigating an elderly academic who might be a Nazi war criminal.
A Bosnian prostitute has brought out the white knight in him.
His personal life is a mess:
He's off the booze, but work is the only thing keeping him going.
And his daughter has been run down in the street,
perhaps as a warning to him.

Rebus somehow struggles with all of this,
coming out more or less victorious,
but at a cost to his integrity and his loved ones.

Recommended.
