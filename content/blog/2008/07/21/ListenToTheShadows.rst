Suzanne Milner is a graduate student researching young offenders in Sheffield.
She finds the body of a young woman.
Soon another young woman's body is found.
There seems to be an unexplained connection between several young people.

*Listen to the Shadows* works fairly well as a psychological thriller:
there are enough twists and misdirection to keep us off-balance and 
guessing until the end.
The protagonist, though, is an exasperating mess.
Beset by deep-seated feelings of inadequacy and festered guilt,
she spends most of the book being buffeted by events,
reacting helplessly, unable to cope.
