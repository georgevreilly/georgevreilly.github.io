The Rev. Merrily Watkins is the "deliverance consultant" --
a euphemism for exorcist -- for a diocese on the Welsh border.
A Wiccan couple move into a long-deconsecrated church in a remote village,
and the local fundamentalist-style Anglican priest leads a witchhunt.

The viewpoint characters are all entertaining:
level-headed Merrily; her smart-alec teenager, Jane;
their old codger neighbor, Gomer;
and the two Wiccans, Betty and Robin.
The plot is both page-turning and unhurriedly developed:
the first body takes 250 pages to appear.
We learn something about contemporary village life,
Wales, Anglicanism, Wicca, and religious intolerance.

Recommended.
