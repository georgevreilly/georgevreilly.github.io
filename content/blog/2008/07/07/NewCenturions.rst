Three very different young men graduate from the Los Angeles Police Academy in 1960.
Wambaugh's classic first novel follows them for five years
until they meet again under fire in the Watts Riots.

In a series of vignettes, Wambaugh shows how
they become hardened and cynical on the streets.
Some will absorb the racist attitudes of their fellow officers.
All will see horrifying things
as they serve as patrol officers,
vice cops, or juvenile officers.

Grim but enthralling.
