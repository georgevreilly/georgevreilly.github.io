The Old Races—gargoyles, dragons, vampires, and more—are still around,
though few ordinary humans are aware of them, since they can all assume human form.

Margrit Knight, a feisty Legal Aid lawyer in New York City,
defends Alban, a gargoyle falsely accused of murdering women in Central Park.
She finds herself drawn into murky struggles between different factions
and she becomes increasingly attracted to the statuesque Alban,
who has long been in self-imposed exile.

Gargoyles are a novel twist in the increasingly popular urban fantasy genre.
Entertaining and fast-paced.
