As Dr. Watson famously said of `Irene Adler`_,
"To Sherlock Holmes she is always *the* woman."
Carole Nelson Douglas has parlayed Irene Adler
into a series of books.

In *Spider Dance*, Irene and her friend, Nell Huxleigh, are in New York City,
trying to find out who Irene's long-lost mother was.
The infamous `Lola Montez`_ is the most likely contender.
Holmes is also in town, investigating a grotesque murder at the
`Vanderbilt`_ mansion.
Inevitably, the two cases become tangled up.

Even by the standards of Sherlockiana_,
the plot is improbable:
rogue Ultramontanes_, lost fortunes, mausoleums at midnight.
It's entertaining though, and well-told.
Irene is a pistol.
Lola, whose story is woven through the book, even more so.
Nell, the primary narrator, is a parson's daughter and a former governess.
Her `priggishness`_ is fraying under the assaults of
the unconventional lifestyle she now leads with Irene.
