Two days into his investigation of a missing teenage girl,
PI Nick Petrov has a seizure that wipes out his recent memories.
As he tries to rediscover what it was he was doing,
he comes to realize that this case is somehow connected to
his most famous case, ten years before.

The brain-damaged detective struggling through a once-easy investigation
made for an interesting story.
The plot moves briskly, but by the end has devolved
into total improbability with gaping holes.

Consider my credulity—and charity—strained.
