    :alt: AIDS Walk 2008

This year is the 22nd anniversary of the Northwest AIDS Walk.
A whole generation has passed.
Twenty years ago, AIDS was a gay man's disease and a death sentence.
The Reagan administration was just beginning to
acknowledge the existence of AIDS,
half a decade after it had first been recognized and 
thousands had died.

AIDS is still a serious problem, but the development of antiretroviral 
drugs a decade ago means that people with HIV
are living longer, healthier lives than before.
More than 1.5 million Americans are now living with HIV/AIDS:
9,000 of them in King County.
40,000 people are infected every year,
and most new infections are among African-Americans.
The U.S. is getting off relatively lightly:
about one-quarter of the adults in southern Africa have HIV!

The Lifelong AIDS Alliance provides a variety of services to those living 
with HIV/AIDS in Washington State.
LLAA cooks more than 130,000 fresh meals each year,
provides case management for 1200 people,
provides 1400 people with health insurance support,
packs 30,000 grocery bags,
and distributes condoms and safe-sex information to high-risk populations.

I've walked in the AIDS Walk every year since 1992 and I've raised 
thousands of dollars for AIDS.
Please help me raise money again for `this year's walk`_
on Saturday, October 4th.
I aim to raise at least $750.

You can sponsor me by going to http://www.georgevreilly.com/aidswalk.

*Note*: Emma and I are having a fundraising barbecue on
Saturday, September 27th.
Email me for more details.

I thank you, the Lifelong AIDS Alliance thanks you,
and the people you'll be helping thank you.
