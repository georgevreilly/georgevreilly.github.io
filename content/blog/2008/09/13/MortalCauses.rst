(An earlier Rebus book than `The Hanging Garden`_ or `The Naming of the Dead`_.)

A brutally murdered man has ties to Protestant `loyalist`_ paramilitaries
in Northern Ireland.
He also happens to be the unacknowledged son of Rebus’s old nemesis,
Big Ger Cafferty, who wants revenge.
Never a team player, Rebus goes his own way, solving the case
against the backdrop of the `Edinburgh Fringe Festival`_
and a socially deprived `housing scheme`_.
