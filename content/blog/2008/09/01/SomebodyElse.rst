Betsy Thornhill had a face lift.
It worked so well that she now passes for her mid-thirties,
instead of 51.
After decades in London,
she moves back to Manhattan a few months after 9/11.
Within days, a man who came on to her is dead,
and she's the main suspect.

I didn't like this book or Betsy.
I couldn't believe that all the male characters would throw
themselves at her |---| she looks great,
but her personality and confidence are lacking.
Implausibly, Betsy fails to *think* about her estranged daughter, Franny,
for 160 pages, despite the strain of being a murder suspect and
despite the importance of Franny for the rest of the book.

Don't bother.
