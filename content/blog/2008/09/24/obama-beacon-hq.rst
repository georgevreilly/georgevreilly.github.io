I spent some time earlier this evening phone banking for
Obama and some Washington State races,
at the new Beacon Hill HQ:

    We now have a location on Beacon Hill to volunteer for Obama and Gregoire.
    It's between Horton and Hinds on Beacon Ave. S.  It's a place you can
    volunteer for phone banking or pick up packets to canvass your neighbors.

    There's an open house on Wednesday, September 24th between 5 and 9 pm. Stop
    by to phone bank, share food with your neighbors, and get to know other
    Obama supporters in your area.

    For exact location and details contact:

    |   Michele Frix
    |   Washington State Democrats-Coordinated Campaign
    |   Field Organizer/11th Legislative District
    |   michele@wa-democrats.org
    |   206.617.7281

It'll be open every evening and weekend for the next six weeks.
