If you're reading this post directly on `my blog`_,
you have probably noticed that the top section in the sidebar
is “George Reilly’s shared items”.

    [This post is describing how this blog worked when it ran on DasBlog]

If you're reading this through an RSS reader,
let me tell you that
that section contains various `items`_ that I'm sharing 
through `Google Reader`_.
Mostly these are items that I've read from blogs
that I'm subscribed to in Google Reader,
but I'm also using the `Note in Reader bookmarklet`_
to share arbitrary webpages.
If I choose, I can add a note to each item that I share.

Formerly, I would occasionally summon up the energy to
post some `Odds and Ends`_.
Now I'm more likely to share those items in Reader.

If you're using Google Reader,
you can subscribe to my shared items by
adding ``george.v.reilly`` as a friend.
Otherwise, you can occasionally check `my blog`_
or this `shared items`_ link.

There doesn't seem to be a way for me to make my
shared items into an RSS feed, alas.
