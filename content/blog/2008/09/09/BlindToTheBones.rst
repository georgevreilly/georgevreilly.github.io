Later in the series of Cooper-Fry books than
`Dancing with the Virgins`_.
Detective Constable Ben Cooper's working relationship
with Det. Sgt. Diane Fry has improved somewhat,
with Fry now according Cooper a modicum of wary respect.

They find themselves separately investigating two crimes
in the remote Derbyshire village of Withens:
the disappearance of a teenage girl two years ago
and the recent murder of a young man.
At the heart of local matters are the extended Oxley family—\
suspicious, clannish, and looked down upon—\
and Ben must find out what they know.
Meanwhile, Diane is distracted by her own private investigation
of the long ago disappearance of her own older sister.

Two strong characters and a fairly good plot,
marred by an overly neat ending.
