Fifteen months after the release of Vim 7.1,
Bram announced_ the release of Vim 7.2 last weekend.
No major new features, just the consolidation of more than 300 patches.
He also included a mention of the new distribution point
for Win64 binaries, the `vim-win3264`_ project that I set up at Google Code.

Bram has no way of testing the Win64 version,
so I'm providing the official build at vim-win3264.
I will no longer provide Win64 binaries for Vim from my own site.
The Vim 7.2 sources compile the Win64 binaries cleanly
(unlike the 7.1 release).
I'll provide occasional intermediate releases up there too,
for both Win32 and Win64.

I'm rather surprised to see that the Win64 binary has
already been downloaded 248 times in the last week.
It's such a pain to look at the logs on my server
that I have no idea how many times earlier binaries 
were downloaded.
