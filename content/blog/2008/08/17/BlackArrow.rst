Sugawara Akitada has been appointed as the governor
of a remote northern province in feudal Japan.
Aided only by a handful of retainers,
he is beset by his own doubts and hostile locals.
Winter is closing in and
he must exert his fragile authority to
rein in a mutinous baron,
while also investigating some mysterious deaths
and righting old wrongs.

Parker evokes the spare, stark beauty of Japan,
in a well-written historical mystery.
