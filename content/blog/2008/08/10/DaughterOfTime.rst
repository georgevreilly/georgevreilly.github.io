King `Richard III`_, hunchback, last of the Plantegenets,
one of Shakespeare's blackest villains_,
and long decried as the murderer of `Princes in the Tower`_.
But did he really murder his nephews to cement his hold on his throne?

Inspector Grant, confined to a hospital bed,
is given a portrait of Richard III,
and finds that he cannot believe that
this was the face of a cold-blooded villain.
Aided by a young historial researcher,
he conducts an inquiry from his bed,
and makes a convincing case that another was the murderer.
