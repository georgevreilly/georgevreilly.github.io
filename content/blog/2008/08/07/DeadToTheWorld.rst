Sequel to `Club Dead`_.

A coven of evil, powerful witches has moved into the area,
and are causing havoc amongst the local supernaturals.
The local vampire boss has been bespelled and lost his memory,
and Sookie has to look after him.
He's very attractive and she's on the rebound.
And her brother has gone missing.

Sookie is a nice gal, struggling with a disability -- telepathy
causes more trouble than it solves -- and trying to survive
on the edges of the dangerous world of the Supes.
