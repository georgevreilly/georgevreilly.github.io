We saw Shakespeare in the Park's production of `Twelfth Night`_
at Seward Park last week,
which prompted me to re-read this book.

Fifteen years ago, Theophilos, an agent of the Fool's Guild,
then working in his guise as Feste the Jester,
initiated the events roughly described in Shakespeare's play,
and foiled Saladin's agent, Malvolio.
Now the duke of Orsino is dead under suspicious circumstances,
and Theo goes back, disguised as a German merchant.

Theo is witty, quick-witted, and politically astute,
making for an engaging narrator
of this medieval mystery.
