Miscellaneous links.

*   Do you see the `subliminal arrow`_ in the `negative space`_
    of the FedEx logo at right?
    Neither did I until I read about it at `Edward Tufte's joint`_.
    Now I can't stop seeing it.

*   One more year to go until the next presidential inauguration
    on 2009/01/20.
    Who knows how much more damage Bush can pull off by then?
    StickerGiant.com has `commemorative swag`_.

*   Impeachment is in the air.
    Watch Rep. Wexler_'s speech before the U.S. House of Representatives.
    Read about State Sen. Oemig_'s hearing in the Washington Legislature.

*   Three days ago, I was sent email by `DraftBloomberg.com`_,
    asking me to sign a petition to draft Mike Bloomberg
    as an independent candidate for President.
    I promptly wrote back, refusing on the grounds that
    (a) I view Bloomberg as a Naderesque spoiler who's
    likely to take votes from the Democratic nominee, and
    (b) I find Bloomberg to be an uncompelling candidate
    who just happens to be rich enough to self-finance.
    Looking at their site a few minutes ago,
    I see that they've only managed to scrape up 1,522 signatures,
    which is pathetic.

*   Ron Paul enjoys an improbable level of support on the Internet,
    raising staggering amounts of money
    by appealing to the libertarian bloc.
    But there's compelling evidence that Paul is a `Bircherite not a libertarian`_,
    with lucrative ties to white supremacists going back more than 20 years.

*   `Harold Meyerson argues`_ that we are entering a recession
    and the old remedies won't do, because the US economy is
    no longer fundamentally sound.

        Wages have been flat-lining for a long time now,
        the housing bubble isn't going to be reinflated anytime soon,
        and the upward pressure on oil prices is only going to mount.
        As in Roosevelt's time, we need a policy that boosts incomes
        and finds new solutions for our energy needs.

    Scholars & Rogues argue that `getting out of Iraq`_
    can fund the necessary changes to get us out of a recession.

*   Although I'm generally willing to believe the worst
    of the Bush administration,
    I've never found the 9/11 conspiracy theories to be plausible.
    Matt Taibbi `debunks 9/11 conspiracy theories`_ to my satisfaction.

*   On a positive note, the `.NET Source Code is now available`_.
    You can debug through the source of the Microsoft libraries,
    when you need to.
    Visual Studio 2008 only.
