*   Are you plagued by User Access Control prompts
    every time you run `Notepad++`_ on Vista?
    See `Notepad++ and the GUP`_ for a fix.

*   According to The Onion, `Bill Clinton is running again`_.

    We saw him speak at a `fundraiser for Jim McDermott`_ a couple of years ago.
    It was impressive to see him stand up for an hour and
    riff on all manner of topics without notes.
    The current incumbent is truly a mental midget.

    Not that I especially enjoyed the Clinton years.
    I often felt left down.

*   Larry Lessig is unhappy with the `sleaze`_
    emanating from Hillary Clinton.

*   Joel Spolsky's article on the `Five Whys`_
    showcases a useful technique to find the root cause of
    problems by iteratively asking *why*.
    He also links to a great New Yorker piece on
    the efficacy of `medical checklists`_.

*   It looks like Harry Reid is trying to give immunity to the telecoms
    for illegally wiretapping US citizens.
    Senators Dodd and Feingold are planning a filibuster_.
    Glenn Greenwald has more_.

    I contacted Obama and Clinton, telling them:

        Senator ___, you are still a sitting senator.

        I have been underwhelmed so far by your actions on TELECOMS IMMUNITY.
        I expect you to go back to Washington DC and filibuster any attempt to grant
        immunity to the telecoms for wiretapping American citizens.

        Thank you.

    (Yes, I've gotten tired of asking nicely.)

    I also contacted Reid, Murray, and Cantwell.

    Some days I feel like a complete crank for caring about this stuff :(
