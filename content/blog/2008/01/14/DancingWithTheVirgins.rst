One woman has been mutilated and another murdered
on the bleak moors of Derbyshire.
Detective Constable Ben Cooper and
Detective Sergeant Diane Fry investigate.

The novel is at least as much about the tense relationship
between Cooper and Fry as it is about the mystery itself.
This is the second in a series of Cooper-Fry books.
Cooper is a local boy, deeply rooted in the rural community,
pleasant and trusting.
Fry is a bitter loner, who transferred in from a distant city.
Quickly promoted over Cooper, she can't understand
his easygoing nature.

The mystery is effective, with enough twists to keep you guessing.
The characters feel real and human, not authorial puppets.
