Another `urban fantasy`_ featuring the witch, Rachel Morgan,
who runs an investigation agency with a vampire,
in a world where ordinary humans were decimated by a virus
and vampires, Weres, witches, pixies, and more live openly.

Morgan is reckless and addicted to living on the edge,
and her friends will pay a heavy price before the end of the book.
You'd want Rachel on your side in a fight,
but you'd probably be exasperated with her the rest of the time.
She battles demons, both metaphorical and literal,
before bringing the book to a bittersweet conclusion.

This is the fifth book in an ongoing series.
The books are heavily linked together and best read in order.

Enjoyable and fast-paced.
