A collection of short stories and a play,
all characteristically dark.
Tales of fucked-up lives,
tales of people with shitty pasts and no futures,
tales of revenge.

Lehane writes brilliantly.
His spare description, his dialogue
brings the characters to life on the page.

The play, "Coronado", is adapted from
an earlier short story, "Until Gwen"
— also part of this collection.
The repetition does not feel redundant.
The play fleshes out the short story,
telling it in a different manner.

Recommended, but depressing.
