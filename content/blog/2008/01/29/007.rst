Miscellaneous links.

*   I've uploaded `Vim syntax highlighting for Socialtext`_,
    the wiki we use at Cozi_.
    Amusingly, it's derived from code
    that I found on the Socialtext website, which in turn is derived from 
    `my syntax highlighting for Flexwiki`_.

    There were lots of interesting, geeky talks the
    `last time I went`_.

*   Via Slashdot_, Walter Kirn on the failure of multitasking_

        Through a variety of experiments, many using functional magnetic 
        resonance imaging to measure brain activity,
        [scientists have] torn the mask off multitasking and revealed its true face,
        which is blank and pale and drawn.

    I have a moderately bad case of multitasking myself.
