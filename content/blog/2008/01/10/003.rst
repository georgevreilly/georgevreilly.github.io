*   We at Cozi partnered with Whirlpool to produce
    an edition of the Cozi software running on a fridge.
    It has been demonstrated at this year's CES_ (Consumer Electronics Show),
    where it's getting `favorable reviews`_.
    `Dory Devlin`_ likes it.
    Watch `Walt Mossberg`_ talk about it too.
