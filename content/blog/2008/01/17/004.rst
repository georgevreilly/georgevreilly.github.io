Miscellaneous links.

*   I mentioned `Schneier on security theater`_ recently.
    Via Pavel, I see that Schneier notes that a
    `five-year-old`_ was detained at SeaTac because
    his name appeared on a no-fly list.

*   Male fruit flies, when `drunk`_, become much more likely
    to court other male fruit flies.
    Or, Oh God, I was so drunk ...

*   Here's a damning `RIAA interview`_, via Gabriel:

        When asked why the RIAA is going after an easy target--college
        students--the response made me cringe: "College students have reached a
        stage in life when their music habits are crystallized," Duckworth
        said. "And their appreciation for intellectual property has not yet
        reached its full development."

    via Will and Amy.

*   From Charlie Stross, `fundies say the darndest things`_:

    -   "Everyone knows scientists insist on using complex terminology to make
        it harder for True Christians to refute their claims. Deoxyribonucleic
        Acid, for example... sounds impressive, right? But have you ever seen
        what happens if you put something in acid? It dissolves! If we had all
        this acid in our cells, we'd all dissolve! So much for the Theory of
        Evolution, Check MATE!"

    -   "A woman wants to abort a rape child? She should have thought of that
        before she walked down that dark alley without a male prescence, not to
        mention she should have thought before putting on revealing attire."

    -   "Apes are just creatures twisted by Satan to mock Jesus by giving
        EVILolition credibility. Further more they are naturally lust crazed
        for human women. Since they are not natural creatures they should be
        exterminated forthwith as the tools of evil they are."

*   From the comments on Charlie's post,
    a very long set of answers from
    `much more thoughtful people on what they've changed their minds about`_.
