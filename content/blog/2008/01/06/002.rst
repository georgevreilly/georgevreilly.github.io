Today's odds and ends.

*   `George MacDonald Fraser`_ died the other day.
    He was the author of the marvelous `Flashman`_ novels.
    I reviewed the `last Flashman novel`_ a year ago.

*   Kiva_ seems like a really good idea,
    connecting people in the emerging world who need microloans
    with people who can afford to lend them $25.

    Last summer, we attended a house party for Marc Gold
    of the `100 Friends`_ project.
    He's a sort of one-man Santa Claus,
    personally handing out money to needy people and organizations.

*   Zane, whose superpower is knowing a Web 2.0 application for every problem,
    reminded me on Friday of Mint_. I just signed up.
    Mint keeps track of your money across all your accounts
    and shows you your spending.

    I wanted to know how they make money,
    but it was hard to track down `why it's free`_.
    They offer you suggestions on alternatives to your current banks,
    credit cards, phone companies, etc.
    If you switch, they get a little cut.

*   `Ian Welsh endorses Edwards`_ and sums up why he thinks
    John Edwards is a better candidate than Clinton or Obama.
