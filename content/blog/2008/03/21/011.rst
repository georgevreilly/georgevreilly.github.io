Time for another Odds & Ends.

Well-known evolutionary biologist PZ Myers (Pharyngula) was expelled_
from a viewing of a new creationist documentary, *Expelled*, last night.
Wait until you read the punchline.
There is a God!

It was St. Patrick's Day on Monday.
Peter sent me the `Muppets' Danny Boy`_ video.
Andrew told me that the
`Irish bishops had moved St. Patrick's Day`_.
Monday was a holiday in Ireland,
as is today (Good Friday) and next Monday (Easter Monday),
so many people took Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday off this week.
Bastards!

Emma and I walked with the `Wild Geese Players`_
in the Seattle Parade last Saturday.
I walked into a fire hydrant afterwards,
while preoccupied with my camera,
leaving me with a deep bruise on my thigh.
I must get around to posting those photos to Flickr soon
(along with many others).

In `Martian Headsets`_, Joel Spolsky discusses Microsoft's
recent decision to make Internet Explorer 8 be standards-compliant
*by default*, which reversed their earlier decision to
be backwards-compatible.
He remarks that they're damned if they do and damned if they don't.

In my opinion, Microsoft has erred too often on the side of
backward compatibility.
I'm firmly in the camp that wants IE to be standards-compliant by default.
After struggling for months with IE6 (and IE7 to a lesser degree),
I believe that we badly need to raise the level of standards compliance
in browsers.
As Jeff Atwood put it three years ago, `IE6 is the new Netscape 4.7x`_:
"the browser that we all wish would go away.
The one that's a pain in the ass to support."
