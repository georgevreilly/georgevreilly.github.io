Two scientists are researching Near-Death Experiences,
to learn what causes them and what happens during them.
This is partly a detective story, partly a story about doing science.
The two main characters are likeable and there's a memorable cast
of supporting characters:
the garrulous WWII veteran;
the manipulative but charming nine-year-old girl;
the horrible psychic fraud;
the hardboiled ER nurse;
the former English teacher with Alzheimer's;
and his caretaker niece.

Entertaining, but too long.
