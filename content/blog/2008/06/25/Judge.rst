*Judge* is the sixth and final book in the `Wess'har Series`_,
and the sequel to Ally_.

For the first time, focus shifts to 25th-century Earth,
as the ecologically radical Eqbas arrive to clean up the mess.
Once again, the central themes are ethics and environmentalism,
and the moral quandaries posed by the existence of *c'naatat*,
a parasite that confers immortality upon its host.
The series draws to a close,
resolving the fates of the central characters:
the ruthlessly principled former cop, Shan Frankland;
her two husbands,
the gentle marine, Ade Bennett,
and the alien war criminal, Aras;
and Eddie Michallat, the journalist.

It's an impressive series of novels:
strong characters, an interesting plot,
aliens with fundamentally non-human ethics,
moral dilemmas, and conflict galore.
