Molly Murphy, an early twentieth-century private detective,
returns from New York to her native Ireland,
in order to track down her client's long-lost sister.
Along the way, she encounters a dead body in her cabin,
revolutionaries in Dublin, and (briefly) James Joyce.

Molly is engaging and quick-witted,
with a contrarian streak that gets her into trouble.
Bowen evokes the early 20th century from bustling New York
to the social stratifications of a liner,
to British-occupied Dublin.

The book is marred by some elementary geographical errors:
the River Liffey, not Liffy;
Dublin is on the Irish Sea; the North Sea is on Britain's eastern coast.
