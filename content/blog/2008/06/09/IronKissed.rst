Mercy Thompson, coyote shape shifter, mechanic, and
heroine of `Blood Bound`_ and `Moon Called`_,
is asked to investigate the murder of some fae.
The fae (faery) are creatures from the old tales,
barely assimilated into modern society,
and far more dangerous than Disney tales suggest.
One of their own, Mercy's mentor, is falsely accused of the murder.
Most of the fae would rather see him go down
so that the whole thing will blow over quickly.
Mercy is determined to get him off,
and that doesn't sit well with the fae.
Not to mention, she's juggling two suitors,
both alpha werewolves.

An entertaining, fast-paced read.
