I'm delighted!
Today, the American people made an excellent decision
and chose the right man for the job.

Obama fought a long, hard campaign,
rising from underdog to an assured victory.
He ran an exemplary, innovative campaign,
that empowered millions of grassroots activists.
He shattered barriers and inspired voters.

He won by a huge margin in the Electoral College,
giving himself unequivocal legitimacy.
He'll need it.
The country has deep problems and it's not going to be an easy presidency.

Nevertheless, I look forward to the next four years.
