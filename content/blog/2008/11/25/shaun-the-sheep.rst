By a serendipitous accident poking around on the TiVo a few weeks ago,
we found that the Disney channel is broadcasting `Shaun the Sheep`_.
It's a series of seven-minute shorts spun off from `Wallace and Gromit`_.

Shaun is the one smart sheep on a smallholding.
His inquisitive nature leads to all kinds of mischief.
The flock follow along;
the sheepdog sometimes helps, sometimes hinders.
All the while, the farmer is oblivious.
No dialog, just slapstick.
Highly recommended.

I learned today that a new 30-minute Wallace and Gromit,
`A Matter of Loaf and Death`_, premieres on BBC TV at Christmas.
I'm not sure when it'll be shown in the US.
We'll be in Dublin for two weeks then,
so we'll be sure to watch it.
