    Seattle Protest March against Proposition 8
    </div>

I mentioned the `other day`_ there were to be protest marches
all over the country today against Proposition 8,
the anti-gay marriage amendment that passed last week in California.

Thousands marched in Seattle, from Volunteer Park to Westlake Center.
The P-I and the Seattle Times say 3,000.
`The Stranger`_ says 6,000.
I was one of them. It was a lot.
Westlake was jammed.

The crowd was in good spirits.
Pissed off at the votes in California, Florida, Arizona, and Arkansas,
but determined to keep on fighting.
Certain that time and right are on our side,
that we will in the end triumph.

`Equal Rights Washington`_ is coordinating the fight in this state.
Give them your time and money.
