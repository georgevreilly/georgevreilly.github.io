    :class: right-float

I've been very happy with my `MacBook Pro`_.
It's my primary home machine,
sitting on the living room coffee table,
and getting far more use than the desktop system
in my office upstairs.

But it rarely leaves the house.
It's big–a 17" screen–and it's heavy.
I seldom carry it anywhere and I hardly ever bring it to a coffee shop.

I bought myself a netbook_ last month, an `Asus Eee 1000H`_:
10" screen, 1024x600, 1.6GHz dual core Atom_,
1GB RAM, 160GB hard disk, 3lbs, $479.
Look at how much bigger the MacBook is in the photo!
For reference, the Eee 1000H is the same size as a magazine.
It's small enough and light enough that I take it with me every day,
and it's been inside many a coffee shop.

The Eee came with Windows XP Home.
I immediately repartitioned it and put `Ubuntu Eee`_ on the second partition.
I don't think I've booted back into Windows after the first few days.
All the devices (webcam, sound) and apps (Skype, Flash) work
and I have all the Ubuntu goodness,
optimized for this form factor,
instead of a seven-year-old operating system.

The keyboard is adequate for my slender hands,
though I would not care to do a lot of writing on it.
The main problem that I continue to have with it
is the placement of the right-hand Shift key,
to the right of the Up-arrow key.
My touch-typing fingers expect to find Shift beside the ``/``, dammit.

The Elantech trackpad drove me nuts initially.
Under both XP and Ubuntu Eee, it's configured with all kinds of multitouch gestures.
Far too often, I inadvertently clicked or selected merely by hovering
over the trackpad while typing.
With some pain (especially on Ubuntu),
I figured out how to turn all that crap off, so that it merely moves
the mouse around and the right edge scrolls.

The screen is a little too small at 1024x600.
The `Netbook Remix`_ interface replaces the GNOME desktop
with a custom launcher.
Each window runs maximized by default with minimal trimmings.

For a low-power machine, it's surprisingly fast.
The Atom_ has two cores, so even if one is maxed out,
the other one keeps the machine responsive.
1GB has been sufficient so far, but I'll probably get a 2GB stick
because RAM is cheap.

I'm very pleased with the Eee.
It nicely complements my MacBook.
