A new series from the author of `Garnethill`_.
1981: Paddy Meehan is an 18-year-old Catholic,
living at home in working-class Glasgow.
She works as a copy boy at a newspaper
and aspires to be a journalist.
In what seems to be an open-and-shut case,
a three-year-old boy is murdered by two unnamed ten-year-olds.
One of them is her fiancé's cousin.
She blurts that out in shock;
the newspaper publishes it,
causing her tight-knit community to shun her.

Paddy is forced to do a lot of growing up,
while she investigates who led the ten-year-olds on.
The shunning changes her.
She realizes that she's not cut out to be the good little housewife
expected by her family and fiancé,
that she'd really rather be a journalist.
Quick witted, she learns to give as good as she gets
in the overwhelmingly male newsroom.
Her duplicity causes one death and causes other havoc;
the realizations will hit her hard.
