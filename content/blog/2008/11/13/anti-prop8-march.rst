Angry about the passage of Proposition 8,
the anti-gay marriage amendment in California,
and other anti-gay measures in `Florida, Arizona, and Arkansas`_?

A nationwide protest is planned for 10:30am PST on Saturday, November 15th.
The `Seattle protest`_ starts at Volunteer Park.
Festivities begin at 10:30, the rally begins at noon,
then we'll march down to Westlake, concluding with a rally there at 2:00.

The Stranger has `more background`_.

I'll be there.
Will *you*?

In the meantime, watch two moving videos from
`Keith Olbermann`_ and `Sam Harris`_.
