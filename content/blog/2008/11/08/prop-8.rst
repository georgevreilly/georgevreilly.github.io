    :alt: Bert and Ernie: Support Gay Marriage
    :class: right-float

There was only sour note to the huge victories in Tuesday's elections:
the passage of Proposition 8, the anti-gay marriage amendment in California.
A deceitful campaign preyed on voters' fears and homophobia.
The No on 8 campaign was massively outspent and not very effective.

I'm convinced that marriage equality will come, but this is a setback.
Gay couples, who only gained the right to marry earlier this year in 
California, have lost that right.

The Mormon Church was the prime mover behind the Yes on 8 campaign,
donating $19 million, nearly 80% of the total raised.
A backlash is brewing.
John Aravosis of AmericaBlog_ is trying to organize a boycott of Utah.
Others are trying to get the `tax-exempt status`_ of the Latter Day Saints repealed:
sign the petition_.
