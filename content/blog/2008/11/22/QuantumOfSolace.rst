Daniel Craig once again plays James Bond in `Quantum of Solace`_.
`Casino Royale`_ rebooted the Bond franchise,
going back to Bond's first 00 mission to recreate the character.
The plot takes up where *Casino Royale* left off,
as MI6 becomes aware of a hitherto secret organization, Quantum,
a sort of latter-day SPECTRE.

Said plot makes as little sense as these plots normally do.
Rich, evil mastermind wants to corner the market on <substance>
as a stepping stone towards world domination;
Bond follows villain and henchmen across several continents,
blowing stuff up and killing people;
sexy women are bedded along the way;
nice suits, fast cars, and gadgets all get a workout.

Emotionally, *Quantum* is on a sounder footing.
Bond still grieves for Vesper, who died at the end of Casino Royale.
His need for revenge drives him,
compounded by the treachery of a Quantum mole.
This Bond is tough, but not impervious.
Events have gotten under his skin.
Under M's too:
initially disdainful, she develops some trust for Bond.

The action is more than adequate.
The first half hour is a blur of car and foot chases,
bruising fights, and shootouts.
A great deal more action will follow later.

Connery used to be my favorite Bond.
If Craig keeps this up, he'll take the crown.
