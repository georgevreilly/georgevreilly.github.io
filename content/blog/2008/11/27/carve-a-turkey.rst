    How to Carve a Turkey
    </div>

Just in case you need some tips for tomorrow's feast.

We're hosting a dinner.
My Irish friends, Paul and Maggie,
who moved to San Jose at the end of last year,
have come up for a few days.
It will be their first Thanksgiving together in the States.
We'll also be joined by Frank & Lyndol,
Raven & Iain, and Peter & Carol.

We're cooking the turkey at high heat,
using Barbara Kafka's `500F recipe`_.
The others are bringing everything else.
Yum.
