For decades, Detroit has fought a rearguard action against 
changeâ€”seatbelts, CAFE standards for increased fuel efficiency,
metrication, renewable energy, building gas guzzling SUVs
instead of hybrids, all come to mind.

Change is needed.
The current management must go.
The big three must build vehicles that make sense.

It's not often that I agree with Mitt Romney,
but his op-ed piece, `Let Detroit Go Bankrupt`_,
in Wednesday's NYT lands in the vicinity of the mark.

He ignores one big reason for the higher costs of American cars,
the cost of company-funded healthcare.

But another article in the same day's paper,
`Advantage of Corporate Bankruptcy Is Dwindling`_,
points out:

    Harsh as it is, a bankruptcy filing has always offered a glimmer of 
    hope for a business hobbled by debt or a downturn. A company could slim 
    down, negotiate manageable payments to workers and suppliers and keep 
    going, preserving jobs.

    ...

    So companies battling for survival have lost another lifeline.
    While they might have once gotten together with their creditors and worked 
    out a plan in the common interest, they are avoiding bankruptcy court 
    if at all possible because they know that without ready access to 
    credit, the odds of emerging from legal proceedings are slim.

It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better, I fear.
