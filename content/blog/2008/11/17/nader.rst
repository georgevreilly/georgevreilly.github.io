Via AmericaBlog_, I see that Kos_ is ridiculing Nader and
his diehard supporters.

I was mildly sympathetic to Nader in 2000,
though I emphatically disagreed with him that
Gore and Bush were Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
`Eric Alterman`_ argues that Nader cost Gore the election.

I was pissed when Nader ran in 2004,
after going dark for three years.
He had built up a big movement in 2000.
Nearly three million people voted for him.
If he was remotely serious about the issues he was campaigning on in 2000,
he would have done something in 2001â€“2003.
God knows there was plenty of things that needed fighting.
He could have made a difference.
But he didn't.
He didn't do a damn thing until he ran in 2004.
After that, we didn't hear from him again until he ran in 2008.

Hypocritical, egotistical bastard.
