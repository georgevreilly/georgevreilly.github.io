    :alt: #1 Technical Blog on Google, revisited
    :target: /content/binary/technical-blog-google-2.jpg

A week ago, I said that my `technical blog`_ somehow comes up as
`#1 technical blog`_ on Google.

Several people pointed out that in my screenshot,
I was logged in to Google.
As you can see if you click on this screenshot,
I can reproduce this result even when I'm not signed in.

I'm still confounded by that ranking.
My content is good, but largely unremarkableâ€”though
I'm unduly fond of `A Use for Octal`_;
my style is understated;
my traffic is uncongested;
and my top billing is undeserved.

But none of the technical blogs listed on that first page
are of the first order, except `Mark Russinovich`_'s.

If I thought it made sense, I'd be flattered.
Alas, I cannot make it so.
