Use `O'Reilly Maker`_ to generate book covers.
I've always wanted to write a book for cousin Tim,
and now I have!

`The Photographer's Right`_: a handy one-page guide.

    The general rule in the United States
    is that anyone may take photographs
    of whatever they want when they are
    in a public place or places where they
    have permission to take photographs.
    Absent a specific legal prohibition
    such as a statute or ordinance,
    you are legally entitled to take photographs.
    Examples of places that are traditionally
    considered public are streets, sidewalks,
    and public parks.

The tiny ``<code>`` font in Firefox has been bugging me for a long time.
I finally figured out the obvious: Override the Monospace setting.
Tools > Options > Content > Fonts & Colors > Advanced > Monospace:
change *Courier New* at size *13* to *16*.
While you're at it, change the font to *Consolas* or *Lucida Console*
or *Monaco*. Courier New is ugly.

My man, John Edwards, is out of the presidential race.
Some analysis from Corrente_ and `Meteor Blades`_
of Edwards' candidacy.

I have never been enthusiastic about Hillary Rodham Clinton
as a presidential candidate.
She's accumulated 16 years of negatives from being relentlessly
demonized by Limbaugh and his ilk;
she's too damn centrist and corporate for my liking;
and I remain troubled about her vote for the Iraq War
and her refusal to apologize for it.

I am now an Obama voter.
I have expressed some_ doubts_ in the past about his efficacy,
but there's no doubt that his messages of transformation
and inspiration are striking a chord with primary voters.

The Washington state primary on February 19th is a complete farce,
at least if you're a Democrat.
The Democratic presidential candidates are entirely chosen by the
Washington state *caucuses* on Saturday, February 9th.
Washington state law requires that a presidential primary be held,
but the parties are not actually obliged to select any delegates
as a result of the vote.
The Republicans delegates will be allocated 49% from the caucus
results, and 51% from the primary results.

I'm the Democratic Precinct Committee Officer for SEA-1945,
and I'll be participating in our neighborhood caucus
at Asa Mercer School.
I need to phone participants of the previous caucus today,
both in my own precinct and some adjoining, PCO-less precincts,
to remind them of the caucus.

I've uploaded `Vim syntax highlighting for PBwiki`_,
a free, hosted wiki that I've used for a few different projects.
