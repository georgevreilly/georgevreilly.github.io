George Cautley, a young gentleman of indifferent background,
comes to London in 1770 and attempts to enter society,
hoping to make his way as a painter.
He becomes obsessed with Lady Beauclair,
who sits for her portrait
and spins him a tale of a castrato_ opera singer,
who fifty years earlier fled Italy for London.


Lady Beauclair is not what she seems.
Indeed, *nothing* is what it seems in this novel.
Everything is a mask.
Or a masquerade.
Arch whispers.
Veiled glances.
Layers of face paint hiding blemishes.
New portraits daubed on top of old.
Deception.
Intrigue.
