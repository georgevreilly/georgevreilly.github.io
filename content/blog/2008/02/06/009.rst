I sent this letter to the New York Times this morning:

    I was struck by the juxtaposition of `Anya Kamenetz's thoughtful column`_
    and `Maureen Dowd's puerile nonsense`_ on today's op-ed page.

    Anya Kamenetz's makes a sensible proposal on empowering ready teenagers by
    lowering the age thresholds for voting, drinking, credit cards when they
    demonstrate maturity.

    Maureen Dowd continues in her usual rut, going on again about Cheneyesque
    paranoia, Bill's legacy, Obambi, and tough dames.

    Perhaps Ms. Dowd could take Ms. Kamenetz's maturity test.

We attended a Super Tuesday party last night.
As a PCO, I know a fair bit about the local caucus process,
but I was unable to give a good answer about who the
*super delegates* are.
What should I find in my email as soon as I got home,
but a list of the Washington State super delegates.

*   Rep. Brian Baird (3rd District)
*   Rep. Norm Dicks (6th District)
*   Rep. Jim McDermott (7th District)

**Democratic National Committee Members**

Methinks the lady doth protest too much,
