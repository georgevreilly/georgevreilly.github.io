*Cursor's Fury* is the third book in Jim Butcher's fantasy series,
`Codex Alera`_, and the sequel to `Academ's Fury`_.

Tavi is now a cursor, a special agent of the First Lord.
Planted undercover in a newly-formed legion,
Tavi suddenly becomes its leader when all the other officers are assassinated,
just as an invading force of Canim have landed nearby.
Meanwhile, his aunt Isana, is trapped in a besieged city,
when one of the High Lords, Kalare, attempts a coup.
Isana's brother Bernard and his wife Amara
lead an attack against Kalare.

Exciting and entertaining, with almost every chapter ending in
a cliffhanger for one of the principals.
