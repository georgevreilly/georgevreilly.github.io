Another book from the `1632 series`.
This one largely develops a new plot.
The archduchess Maria Anna of Austria is sent to Bavaria
to marry the newly widowed Duke Maximilian,
and finds that she'd rather not.
She flees Munich in the company of two Grantville women,
triggering a major crisis.

The book is entertaining but it's marred by obsessively
detailing the enormously complicated realpolitik of Mitteleuropa_.
Still, it's one of the good books in the 1632 series.
