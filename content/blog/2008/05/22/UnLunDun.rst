Deeba and Zanna, both twelve-year-old London girls,
find their way into Un Lun Dun (UnLondon).
Magic works in the abcity:
there's feral rubbish, the ghosts of Wraithtown, words made flesh.
Most of all, there's the Smog,
an enormous cloud of pollution that's become sentient
and wants to consume *everything*.

This book is aimed at a younger audience than his `Bas-Lag`_ novels,
such as `Iron Council`_.
Supporting characters do die and Deeba must undergo trials,
but this book is not grim.
Indeed, in places, it's positively whimsical,
and Miéville owes a clear debt to earlier English fantasists,
like `Mervyn Peake`_ and Lewis Carroll.

Recommended.
