A half-vampire vampire hunter, her half-elf partner, a human sage,
and a very unusual dog travel deep into elven territory,
to rescue his imprisoned elf mother.
None of the (part) humans are welcome.

This is the fifth book in a series, which I didn't notice when I picked it up.
I should have started with the first in the series,
but I was able to follow along well enough.

A high fantasy epic leavened with vampire lore.
Certain of the elves are concerned with an ancient enemy,
which seems to be the creator of the vampires.
Cultural clashes, hidden agendas, and betrayals abound.
