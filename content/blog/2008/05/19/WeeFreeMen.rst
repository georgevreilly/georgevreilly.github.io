Tiffany Aching is a nine-year-old dairymaid
with the First Sight and the Second Thoughts.
She *sees* more than others do.
She *sees* the tiny Nac Mac Feegle,
the little thieving fighting pictsies,
who speak with a Scottish brogue
and have nae time for laird nor queen.

When the Queen of the Fairies
attempts to invade the Discworld
by stealing children and their dreams,
it is up to Tiffany to stop them.

Ostensibly aimed at children,
any adult fan of Pratchett's Discworld novels
should enjoy this book too.
