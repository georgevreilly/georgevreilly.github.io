A Sydney pole dancer known as ‘the Doll’
has a one-night stand with a Muslim.
The next day she's the subject of a massive witchhunt
as a suspected terrorist.
After 9/11, the `Bali bombings`_, and the Iraq war,
Australians are ripe for the fearmongering of the media.
An escalating cycle of hype and fear and ever more lurid headlines
plunges the Doll into a waking nightmare from which she cannot escape.

This novel indicts everyone:
the ordinary people who unthinkingly condone events;
the security forces with their own agenda;
and most of all, the media who seize on a good story
without caring about the truth.
It's all too plausible, alas.
