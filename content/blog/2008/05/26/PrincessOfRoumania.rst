In a parallel world, Roumania is a great European power
and America is a barely settled wilderness.
Miranda was sent to our world by her aunt, Princess Aegypta,
when she was a small child, for her own safety.
Now Aegypta and the Baroness each want to retrieve her,
for their own reasons.

The book revolves around Miranda and her two friends,
lost and confused in the primeval forests of New England,
and the Baroness in Bucharest,
The latter is the more interesting character:
an impulsive former actress who climbed into high society
and is now falling downwards,
struggling as her plans go awry.
