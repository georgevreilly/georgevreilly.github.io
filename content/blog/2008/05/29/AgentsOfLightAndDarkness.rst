Next book after `Something From the Nightside`_.

The Unholy Grail has come to the Nightside,
and the angels of both Heaven and Hell want it.
The Fallen and the Elect are deadly and implacable
and wholly careless of casualties.

John Taylor, the man who can find *anything*,
must lay hands on it first and keep it from either side.

A fantasy noir with a heavy dose of black humor.
Moderately entertaining.
