Thirty years ago, Heather and Sunny Bethany, 12 and 15,
disappeared without trace from a Baltimore mall.
A cold case, long forgotten by almost everyone.
Now a woman, arrested after fleeing from the scene of an accident,
blurts out that she's Heather Bethany.

Is she Heather? Or someone else?
She knows so much about the case,
yet there's something off about her and the police don't trust her.
Where's she been? Where's Sunny?
And why did she never come forward before?

We learn the truth by the end of the novel, of course.
The game of cat and mouse between Heather and the police
draws to a satisfying resolution,
which makes psychological sense.
