A sequel to `Dead I Well May Be`_.

June 16, 2004: the Bloomsday centenary.
Michael Forsythe's archnemesis Bridget Callaghan needs him.
Her eleven-year-old daughter has gone missing in Belfast,
and Forsythe may be only one who can find her.

In the course of one very long day that loosely
recapitulates the events of Joyce's Ulysses_,
Forsythe cuts a bloody swathe through the criminal underworld of Belfast.

Gripping, if over the top.
