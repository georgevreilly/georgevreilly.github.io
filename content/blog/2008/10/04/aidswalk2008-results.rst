As I `mentioned last month
</blog/2008/09/22/AIDSWalk2008.html>`_,
I participated in this year's AIDS Walk this morning.

I raised `$1106 online
<http://www.lifelongevents.org/site/TR/AIDSWalk/TeamRaiser?px=1013411&pg=personal&fr_id=1210>`_,
handily exceeding my goal of $750.
I also raised another $115 in cash and checks at the fundraising barbecue
that we threw on September 27th.

Thanks to the 20 people who sponsored me!
