Neal Stephenson's massive, sprawling `Baroque Cycle`_
began with `Quicksilver`_ and continues in the aptly named *Confusion*.
The book interweaves two novels, *Bonanza* and *The Juncto*,
taking place between 1689 and 1702.
*Bonanza* follows Jack Shaftoe,
as he and other galley slaves in Algiers
capture Spanish gold of particular significance to some highly placed alchemists,
and make their way ever eastward,
through Cairo, India, Manila, and Mexico.
*The Juncto* deals primarily with Eliza,
now a French duchess,
and her remarkable financial derring-do.

The previous book concerned itself with the intellectual ferment
around the `Royal Society`_ and European savants, such as `Leibniz`_.
Major themes of this book include œconomics, alchemy,
and the dawn of the `Enlightenment`_.

Entertaining, but also far too long.
