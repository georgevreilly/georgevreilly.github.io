Since the summer, I've been working on and off on a mobile site for Cozi.
Chris, one of our interns, did a lot of the initial work.
Getting it to a deployable state has
been my primary focus over the last few weeks.

I'm happy to say that as of today `m.cozi.com`_ is in public beta.
Will wrote a little about it at the `Cozi Blog`_;
take a look at the promo_.

Currently, the mobile site supports shopping lists and the calendar.
In the calendar, you can view, create, and edit your appointments.
On the shopping page, you can update your shopping lists
and cross off items as you move through the store.

Enjoy!
