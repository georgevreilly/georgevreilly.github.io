2008 closes, leaving economic wreckage in its wake.
Personally and professionally, it's been a good year.
At the national level, it's been both a very good year and a disastrous one.
Obama's historic victory is offset by the imploding economy.

My health remains good, I'm a little fitter than I was a year ago.
I've notched up a few personal milestones,
such as receiving my Competent Communicator award at Toastmasters and
becoming the secretary of Freely Speaking Toastmasters.

My friends and family are, mostly, doing well.
My sister is (still!) on the verge of having her first child.
Emma's health is never great:
she will have surgery to remove abdominal adhesions in a few weeks.
And Frank is in slow decline.

I like my job at Cozi.
I've learned a lot in the last year and
I've seen our products improve enormously since the beginning of the year.
I think we're well placed to ride out the downturn.

That downturn worries me.
The economy was unsound and badly needs restructuring,
but a lot of people are going to get hurt
before it can be fixed.

I still have high hopes for Obama.
I wonder how much he can achieve in that initial honeymoon.
He certainly can't fix everything that's broken.

2009? We live in interesting times.
