(As I mentioned `last night`_,
I read Accelerando (Wikipedia_) in Stanza on my iPhone on the bus.)

*Accelerando* is a set of connected short stories
following three generations of the Macx family
around the Singularity_.
The ideas fly thick and fast (and somewhat confusingly):
minds uploaded into virtual machines, nanotechnology,
posthumans, lobsters brainscans uplifted into space,
an independent-minded AI in a cat's body, economics, …

Thought-provoking and entertaining.
