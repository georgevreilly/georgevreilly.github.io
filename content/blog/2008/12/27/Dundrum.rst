When I was a boy, anytime we said ‘Dundrum’ (a suburb of Dublin),
it was with a snigger, because it was synonymous in our minds
with the `mental asylum`_ located there.
Nowadays, Dundrum is much better known as the home of a large
`shopping centre`_.
I'm so out of touch with Dublin that I hadn't realized 
that there was a major new shopping centre there.
I assumed that people were talking about the unimpressive
little centre that I remembered there from my childhood.
Until today, when we went there to return the 
mobile phone that we had given my mother for Christmas.

Dundrum was, indeed, a madhouse.
There's much talk of a recession in Ireland,
as in the United States,
but there was little evidence of it in Dundrum today.
The Centre was oppressively full: heat, noise, jostling crowds.

My mother wanted a new mobile phone for Christmas.
Her only requirements were that it have a camera,
that it be easy to use, and the buttons easy to read.
The `Samsung Tocco`_ has a nice-looking touch screen and
David and I thought it would be just the thing,
based on our brief experiment with one the other day.

Not so. My mother was totally flummoxed by it.
David and I found it confusing and irritating too.
The scroll works opposite to the way I expected from the iPhone.
Texting was horrible:
instead of an alphabetic keypad on the touchscreen,
it showed the ten digits with three letters on each digit—just like a 
traditional mobile phone.
And the UI locked you into a nasty series of modal dialogs
that were not easy to work with.
I probably would have returned it had I bought it for myself,
and it was insupportable for my mother.
