Simon Canderous, dorky newbie at the underfunded, secretive
Department of Extraordinary Affairs in New York City,
investigates the death of a beautiful ghost
and the apparently respectable cultists at the
Sectarian Defense League.
He has the gift (or curse) of psychometry:
when he touches something,
he can divine its history.

This book wobbles between not very black comedy
and straight urban fantasy,
and doesn't really succeed as either.
