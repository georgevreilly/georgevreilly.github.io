Troublemaking cops–the Resurrection Men–from all over Scotland have been sent 
to the Police Training College to make them into team players.
DI John Rebus is one of them, though his real job is to
get the dirt on three bent cops.
The senior officers who sent Rebus in seem to mistrust him too,
since the Resurrection Men have reopened an old case
where Rebus's behavior was questionable.

Back in Edinburgh, DS Siobhan Clarke is investigating the murder
of an art dealer, where Rebus's old nemesis,
the crime boss Big Ger Cafferty figures prominently.
This seems to be the first book where Clarke comes in to her own
as a character.
Rebus and Clarke traffic in gray areas and moral ambiguity.
The world they must work in is neither clean nor simple,
and their actions cannot always bear close scrutiny.

As in other `Rebus books`_, the two investigations end up
being linked far too neatly for my liking.
