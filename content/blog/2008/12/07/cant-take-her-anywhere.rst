We saw a production of David Sedaris's `Santaland Diaries`_
at the Bathhouse Theater tonight. Funny stuff.

Afterwards, we walked over to the Greenlake Bluwater Restaurant
to get a spot of dinner.
We both ordered Tuscan White Bean soup for a starter,
Emma had the Turkey Pot Pie,
and mine was the Fettucine.

The soup was fine and my fettucine was okay.
Emma's pot pie had problems.
The potatoes were raw and it had a funny lemony aftertaste.
She pushed the plate away and waited for the waitress to come by.
The waitress apologized and brought Emma the menu.
Emma opted for the meatloaf, since that would come quickly.
The manager apologized and offered us a free dessert.

The meatloaf arrived promptly and Emma was happy with it for a while.
Then she got into the center and it was all but raw.
At this point, she gave up
on the grounds that it wasn't her night.
The manager came over to apologize again
and told us there would be no charge for the meal.

We left a tip—the service was attentive—but I don't think we'll be back.
We've never had a really good meal at any of their restaurants,
and none of them are particularly convenient for us.
