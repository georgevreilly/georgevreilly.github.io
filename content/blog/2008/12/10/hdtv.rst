We've gone high-def over the last month.
First, Emma bought a `42" 1080p plasma Panasonic HDTV`_
to replace the 32" CRT TV in our living room.
Although it's wider, it's not overwhelming,
as the slender box sits further back.
The picture's pretty goodâ€”at least when you give it a good signal.

To take advantage of it required a cascade of upgrades.
Our old TiVo served us well for eight years;
appointment TV has long been alien to us.
It's disconnected now, replaced the other day
by a DirecTV Plus DVR and a new satellite dish.
I had heard bad things about the older DirecTV DVRs,
but I have no complaints about this one yet.

I spent a year at Atlas working on advertising
for Video on Demand, but until we got the new DVR,
I had never seen VOD in anyone's home.
VOD gives us an additional, changing catalog of programs and films
that we can download when we choose,
rather than having to record them when they're broadcast.
I drilled a hole in the floor and ran a 50 foot
Ethernet cable into Emma's basement office
to get an Internet connection.

After the DVR arrived, I felt compelled to hook
the TV up to the stereo, which required me to run new speaker wire.
I'm quite sensitive to visual images,
I have a fairly good eye for photographic composition,
and a well-developed typographic sense.
I am however an aural clod and probably tone deaf.
Even so, I can tell that the stereo sounds better than the TV.

I also bought an HDMI-HDMI cable for the DVD Recorder
to replace the initial analog connection through a video switchbox.
And I have a DVI-HDMI cable so that I can hook my MacBook
up to this enormous external monitor.
Only this last is disappointing.
Everything else looks marvelous.
