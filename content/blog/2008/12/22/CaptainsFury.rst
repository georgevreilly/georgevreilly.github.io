*Captain's Fury* is the fourth book in Jim Butcher's fantasy series,
`Codex Alera`_, and the sequel to `Cursor's Fury`_.

Tavi is still undercover as the captain of a legion
fighting the Canim invaders;
an ambitious senator arrives from the capital to take over.
Tavi finally comes into his own,
learning that he is Gaius Octavian,
the hitherto unsuspected son of the First Lord's long-dead heir.
Far to the south, Amara and Bernard accompany the First Lord, Gaius Sixtus,
on a secret mission, walking into the rebellious Kalare.
Their journey bears not a little resemblance to Frodo and Sam's
epic walk into Mordor.

The intrigue and the action come thick and fast,
holding our attention to the end.
