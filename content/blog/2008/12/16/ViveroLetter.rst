Jeremy Wheale is ‘a grey little man in a grey little job’
who doesn't fit in well in swinging London.
His brother is murdered and he finds himself embroiled
in the search for a lost Mayan city in the Yucutan peninsula.
His companions are a rich old archaeologist,
a paranoid young archaeologist, and his attractive wife.
Somewhere out in the jungle is a Mafia don
who's convinced that there's a hoard of gold in Uaxuanoc.

Wheale is an ordinary man who rises to the occasion.
As the tension grows, he finds unsuspected reserves within himself,
leading to a daring standoff with the don.

This is a classic adventure story, well told,
written by one of the `great British thriller writers`_
of the Sixties and Seventies.
More modern books would have strung the action out
over five hundred pages;
Bagley told his story in 250.
