I'm Irish. I was raised on butter.
Not margarine. Butter.
Good Irish butter.
Yellow, creamy, with a little salt.

Melted onto toast.
A soft yellow layer on bread.
A pat of butter on your potatoes.
Fry your eggs in butter.
Let butter melt on your chips.

I knew butter was important in baking,
but I didn't realize until today_ how carefully it should be treated:

    The most common mistakes made by home bakers, professionals say,
    have to do with the care and handling of one ingredient: butter.
    Creaming butter correctly, keeping butter doughs cold,
    and starting with fresh, good-tasting butter
    are vital details that professionals take for granted,
    and home bakers often miss.

    Butter is basically an emulsion of water in fat,
    with some dairy solids that help hold them together.
    But food scientists, chefs and dairy professionals
    stress butter’s unique and sensitive nature
    the way helicopter parents dote on a gifted child.

    “Butter has that razor melting point,” said Shirley O. Corriher,
    a food scientist and author of the recently published
    “BakeWise: The Hows and Whys of Successful Baking” (Scribner).

    For mixing and creaming, butter should be about 65 degrees:
    cold to the touch but warm enough to spread.
    Just three degrees warmer, at 68 degrees, it begins to melt.

    “Once butter is melted, it’s gone,” said Jennifer McLagan,
    author of the new book “Fat: An Appreciation of a Misunderstood Ingredient,
    With Recipes” (Ten Speed Press).

    Warm butter can be rechilled and refrozen,but once the butterfat gets warm,
    the emulsion breaks, never to return.
