I don't, as a rule, pay a great deal of attention to Canadian politics.
I was vaguely aware that something unusual is going on there this week.
Then Emma pointed me to the `Yarn Harlot`_'s explanation
of what's happened.

In brief, for the last two years,
Stephen Harper's minority government has been playing
a high-stakes game, repeatedly forcing the opposition parties
to either vote with him or force an election, which they
would likely lose.

Last week, as soon as Parliament resumed after October's general election,
Harper put forth an "economic strategy", which included removing
federal election subsidies to all partiesâ€”effectively hobbling the opposition.
The opposition were deeply unhappy about that,
and also about the lack of response to the worldwide economic crisis.

They told Harper that he had "lost the confidence of the house",
and that they were ready to form an alternative government.

The matter went to the Governer-General, who today announced
that Parliament would be prorogued_ (suspended) for `53 days`_.

`Wikipedia`_ has more.
Surprisingly, this morning's *New York Times*
had no coverage of the expected meeting with the Governer-General.
