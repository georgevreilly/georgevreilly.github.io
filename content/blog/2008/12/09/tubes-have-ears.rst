Be careful what you say:
you might trigger a Google Alert.

Eric had the temerity last week to gripe_ on his blog
about a certain open source business intelligence product,
and got swarmed by irate defenders.
Apparently he showed up in their Google Alerts.
Some of the posters were helpful,
but the *ad hominem* attackers were more entertaining:

    Your blog has had 22 posts in the past year, and your blogroll includes 
    absolutely no one of note in the open source world. So I think it’s 
    safe to say that while you are pointing out a perception that they 
    should address in some way, that your opinion isn’t worth much.

I'm in his blogroll, but I'll stipulate that I'm not of note,
despite my reach_.
On the other hand, `Ben Collins-Sussman`_ and `Karl Fogel`_
are two of the primary Subversion developers
and Subversion is the VCS for thousands of open source projects.

I mentioned Raymond C's enormous blog post queue in `yesterday's post`_.
I triggered a Google Alert: he emailed me this morning to say that
the queue was up to 16 months! <boggle/>
