Yesterday, I said that it seemed like the economy was one giant Ponzi scheme.

Via Eric, Michael Lewis's `The End of Wall Street's Boom`_

    [Whitney’s] message was clear. If you want to know what these Wall 
    Street firms are really worth, take a hard look at the crappy assets 
    they bought with huge sums of borrowed money, and imagine what they’d 
    fetch in a fire sale. The vast assemblages of highly paid people inside 
    the firms were essentially worth nothing. For better than a year now, 
    Whitney has responded to the claims by bankers and brokers that they 
    had put their problems behind them with this write-down or that capital 
    raise with a claim of her own: You’re wrong. You’re still not facing up 
    to how badly you have mismanaged your business.

    …

    By the spring of 2005, FrontPoint was fairly convinced that something 
    was very screwed up not merely in a handful of companies but in the 
    financial underpinnings of the entire U.S. mortgage market. In 2000, 
    there had been $130 billion in subprime mortgage lending, with $55 
    billion of that repackaged as mortgage bonds. But in 2005, there was 
    $625 billion in subprime mortgage loans, $507 billion of which found 
    its way into mortgage bonds.

    …

    The funny thing, looking back on it, is how long it took for even 
    someone who predicted the disaster to grasp its root causes. They were 
    learning about this on the fly, shorting the bonds and then trying to 
    figure out what they had done. Eisman knew subprime lenders could be 
    scumbags. What he underestimated was the total unabashed complicity of 
    the upper class of American capitalism. For instance, he knew that the 
    big Wall Street investment banks took huge piles of loans that in and 
    of themselves might be rated BBB, threw them into a trust, carved the 
    trust into tranches, and wound up with 60 percent of the new total 
    being rated AAA.

    But he couldn’t figure out exactly how the rating agencies justified 
    turning BBB loans into AAA-rated bonds. “I didn’t understand how they 
    were turning all this garbage into gold,” he says. He brought some of 
    the bond people from Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, and UBS over for a 
    visit. “We always asked the same question,” says Eisman. “Where are the 
    rating agencies in all of this? And I’d always get the same reaction. 
    It was a smirk.” He called Standard & Poor’s and asked what would 
    happen to default rates if real estate prices fell. The man at S&P 
    couldn’t say; its model for home prices had no ability to accept a 
    negative number. “They were just assuming home prices would keep going 
    up,” Eisman says.

    …

    “You have to understand this,” he says. “This was the engine of doom.” 
    Then he draws a picture of several towers of debt. The first tower is 
    made of the original subprime loans that had been piled together. At 
    the top of this tower is the AAA tranche, just below it the AA tranche, 
    and so on down to the riskiest, the BBB tranche—the bonds Eisman had 
    shorted. But Wall Street had used these BBB tranches—the worst of the 
    worst—to build yet another tower of bonds: a “particularly egregious” 
    C.D.O. The reason they did this was that the rating agencies, presented 
    with the pile of bonds backed by dubious loans, would pronounce most of 
    them AAA. These bonds could then be sold to investors—pension funds, 
    insurance companies—who were allowed to invest only in highly rated 
    securities. “I cannot fucking believe this is allowed—I must have said 
    that a thousand times in the past two years,” Eisman says.

A sordid tale of moral bankruptcy.
