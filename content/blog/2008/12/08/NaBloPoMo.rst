In a footnote to the post about `Proposition 8`_ on November 7th,
I said that it was the first in a series of daily posts for NaBloPoMo_,
the National Blog Posting Month, which I had just found out about.

Here I am a month later, having posted something every single evening.
I covered humor; movie and book reviews; being the #1 tech blog (now #2);
politics; Thanksgiving; food; personal stuff; and even some technical posts.
Whew!

Why bother? As with the two-year-old exercise in book reviews,
it was a personal challenge to come up with a post every single evening
for a month.
Sometimes, the events of the day made for an obvious choice;
a few days, I struggled to find a topic.

I have not been batching up posts, though I have a few ideas in the queue.
When I was at Microsoft, I was startled to see `Raymond Chen`_'s
blog post queue.
He had at least two months worth of daily posts queued up on
his personal, internal webserverâ€”http://abject, I think it was called.

I've attempted NaNoWriMo_ three times, where the goal is to write
a 50,000-word novel in the month of November.
In 2001, Emma wrote about 23K words of Stargate SG-1 fanfic,
while I churned out 41K words on a medieval fantasy.
Neither of us has been willing to do anything more with those manuscripts.
In 2002 and 2005, I abandoned my attempts in the first chapter.

NaBloPoMo was a sustainable exercise for me.
I'm going to continue trying to post something every day.
It's said that it takes 3-4 weeks of repetition to form a habit.
We'll see if this one has taken hold.
