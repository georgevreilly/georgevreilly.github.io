When we went to bed on Wednesday night, most of the weekend's snow had melted.
We were woken around 5:30am by two large `thunder claps`_,
attributed to `thundersnow`_.
The snow was falling again and fell for most of the day.

We were sensible and stayed home.
So, it seems, did almost everyone else at Cozi.
I worked remotely for part of the day.
Otherwise, we watched movies.
I felt no desire to go outside and make snowmen,
though we certainly could have.

We fly to Ireland on Saturday morning.
I'm a little worried about getting to the airport.
