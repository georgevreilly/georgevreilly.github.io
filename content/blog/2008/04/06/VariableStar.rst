Joel Johnston is a budding young musician and the son of a Nobel-winning physicist,
who gets engaged to Jinna, a fellow orphan,
only to learn that she's the granddaughter of the richest man in the Solar System.
Her grandfather, The Conrad, wants him to breed more heirs.
In a fit of pique at the deception,
Joel goes on a bender then hops on a colony ship to a distant star.
Even at relativistic speeds, it's going to be a one-way trip.

Fifty years ago, Robert Heinlein wrote a short outline for this book,
then put it aside.
A few years ago, Heinlein's estate asked Spider Robinson to complete it.

Robinson has done a great job of writing another Heinlein novel,
exploring one of his classic themes, a young man finding himself,
and sounding very much like Heinlein himself.

Very enjoyable.
