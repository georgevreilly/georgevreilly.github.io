This book was originally published, to little acclaim, in 1995
before Obama first ran for public office.
His primary claim to fame at that point was that he had been
the first black president of the *Harvard Law Review*.
It was reissued in 2004 after his celebrated keynote speech
at the Democratic National Convention placed him on the national stage.

Obama is articulate and thoughtful.
This excellent memoir tells of his childhood in Hawai'i and Indonesia,
his experiences as a community organizer in Chicago,
and a formative trip to Kenya.

He was raised by his white mother and her parents.
He hardly knew his Kenyan father, a village boy turned Harvard-trained economist.
Obama met his father only once when he was ten,
after his parents separated when he was two.
His ill-formed impressions of his father were significantly changed
by his trip to Kenya, where he learned far more from
his half-siblings and extended family.

Obama's intelligence and capacity for self-examination shine through.
He is frank about his mistakes and his undirected wandering
in his high school and undergraduate years.
He talks of his struggle to find an identity,
part black, part white, feeling an outsider in both worlds.

The contrast with Emperor C-Minus Augustus could hardly be more stark.

Highly recommended.
