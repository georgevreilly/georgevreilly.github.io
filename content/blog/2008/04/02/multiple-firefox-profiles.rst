I find it useful to have multiple Firefox profiles for developing and testing.
A clean profile for testing allows you to replicate most users' environments,
who don't install extensions.
Running a development profile in a separate profile lets you
restart the browser without messing with your default environment.
You can also run Firefox 2 and Firefox 3 side-by-side in separate profiles.
