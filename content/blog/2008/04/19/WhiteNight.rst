*White Night* is the latest paperback in the
`Dresden Files <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files>`_
continuing on from `Proven Guilty`_.

Harry Dresden is a wizard and private investigator in Chicago.
Minor practitioners of magic are being killed
and the evidence points to his half-brother, Thomas.
Harry can't accept that, even if Thomas is a vampire.
Meanwhile, there's a war going on between the wizards
and certain factions of vampires.

Harry is slowly starting to mature, now that he's got responsibilities.
He has an apprentice and two junior Wardens were killed on his watch.
He's just a little less likely to mouth off and think,
but he still has a remarkable talent for pissing people off.

Entertaining, with a relentlessly fast-paced plot.
Recommended.
