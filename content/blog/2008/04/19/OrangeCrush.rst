A loose sequel to `Hammerhead Ranch Motel`_.
The likable serial killer, `Serge A. Storms`_,
is suffering from amnesia and has found himself a job
as the Press Secretary to the Governor of Florida, Marlon Conrad.

Conrad, formerly an airheaded child of privilege,
has undergone an epiphany and has begun caring about the little people.
He's running for re-election and he's on a road trip through Florida in an RV.
This isn't to everyone's liking and several people are gunning for him.

Dorsey is slightly more in control of his plot than in earlier books,
but it still veers clumsily all over the place.
Quite funny in places.
