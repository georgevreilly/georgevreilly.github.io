A paleontologist finds a 65-million-year-old alien fossil.
A few years later, some of her NASA engineer friends
send a probe to the Martian moon Phobos
and find the mummies of more of those aliens
in an ancient station.
They all form part of the crew on the first manned mission to Mars,
to investigate the alien artifacts.

This is a moderately entertaining hard science fiction novel,
with an interesting premise and moderately plausible characters.
I was irritated by the vast amounts of exposition.
The book has a bad case of `as you know, Bob`_.
The authors are bound and determined to explain all the cool stuff
they brainstormed.
