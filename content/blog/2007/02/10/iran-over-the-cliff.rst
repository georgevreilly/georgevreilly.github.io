I'm slightly more hopeful this week about not `Attacking Iran`_
after reading this piece, subtitled `Thelma and Louise Imperialism`_.

    You only have to pick up the morning paper to find the most mainstream
    of official types in an over-the-top mode that, bare months ago, would
    have been confined to the distant peripheries of political argument.
    There's Senator Joe Biden, the very definition of a mainstream man,
    grilling Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice about whether she believes
    the administration already has the authority to attack Iran and
    swearing, if she does, that it "will generate a constitutional
    confrontation in the Senate, I predict to you." (You can add the
    exclamation point to that comment or to similar ones from the likes of
    Senators James Webb and Chuck Hagel among others.)

    ...\-

    Former officials are now crawling out of the Washington woodwork to
    denounce Bush/Cheney policy in Iraq and Iran with the fervor (however
    masked by official Washington language) of an exorcism.

    ...\-

    But it took more than [the work of Sy Hersh, Ray McGovern, and others]
    for so much of official Washington to
    panic. It took the administration's decision to send the USS John C.
    Stennis, a second aircraft carrier task force into the Persian Gulf
    (with hints that a third could follow); it took the announcement of
    what Juan Cole has termed George Bush's "fatwa," allowing the U.S.
    military to take out Iranian agents anywhere in Iraq ("Announcing open
    hunting season on all Iranian visitors to Iraq," Cole wrote, "is like
    playing Frisbee with nitroglycerin. Bush has gone looking for trouble
    and is likely to find it..."); it took the detention by U.S. forces of
    various Iranian officials in Iraq and the invasion of an Iranian office
    in Irbil in Iraqi Kurdistan; ...

but only slightly:

    So feel free to imitate official Washington. Be scared, very scared. An
    attack on Iran, if it were to happen, promises a special mixture of two
    fundamentalisms deeply engrained in our top political and military
    officials that may, in the end, combine into a single lethal brew --
    and that will, in the bargain, give American policy in the Middle East
    the full-blown look of a war on Islam. Though our President is a
    Christian fundamentalist, neither of these Washington fundamentalisms
    are, in the normal sense, religious or particularly Christian.
