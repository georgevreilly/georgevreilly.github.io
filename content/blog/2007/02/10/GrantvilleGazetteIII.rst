The popular `1632 series`_ is a `shared universe`_ of `alternate history`_,
where the small town of Grantville, West Virginia has somehow been 
transported in a Ring of Fire to central Germany in 1631,
during the middle of the `Thirty Years' War`_.
The townspeople adapt fairly successfully and immediately and irrevocably
change the course of history, thanks to their advanced technology.

The Ring of Fire has spawned an active community at `1632.org`_,
leading to a great deal of fan fiction, developing plot lines,
fleshing out major and minor characters, as well as lots of geeky
speculation about technology transfer.

This book is a collection of that fan-generated material.
Only one piece is written by a professional author, Eric Flint,
the creator of the series. The rest is a mixture of fiction
and factual pieces, many continued from the earlier Gazettes.

I found this to be the weakest book of the series.
None of the stories were memorable.
The fiction concentrates on minor events,
generally the culture shock of 17th century Europeans,
trying to adapt to the strange, powerful Americans
who were suddenly thrust upon them.

Not recommended unless you're a completist.
