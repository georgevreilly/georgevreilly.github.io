This book is not a Sherlockian pastiche,
although Mycroft Holmes does appear in two short stories within the story.

Damien March is a 30ish researcher at the BBC,
who unexpectedly inherits a house on a remote island off Cape Cod,
from his late uncle Patrick, a once-successful novelist.
He moves to Ionia and slowly starts inhabiting the life of Patrick.
Brothers are a recurring theme throughout this book:
Patrick and Damien's father; Damien and his brother Vivian;
Mycroft and Sherlock; and others.
Damien comes to an understanding and a reconciliation
of some of those fractured relationships.

One wonders how much of Patrick's character is inspired by
`Marcel Theroux`_'s father, Paul.

This book drags in the first half, but held my interest in the latter half.
Certainly a novel of ideas, rather than of action.
