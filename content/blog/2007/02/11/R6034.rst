I have been cleaning up some issues with the `Win64 port of Vim`_,
including the *Edit with Vim* shell extension not working very well.
When I built the shell extension with VS 2005 on x86, I would
get the following whenever I right-clicked in Explorer::

    Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library

    Runtime Error!

    Program: C:\WINDOWS\Explorer.EXE

    R6034

    An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrectly.
    Please contact the application's support team for more information.

There was no mention of which application was at fault,
though it was obvious in this case.
I have also seen some mention of ``verclsid`` in the error dialog,
though not when I took this snapshot.

The underlying problem relates to SxS, Fusion, and all that good stuff.
By far the simplest fix was for me to statically link with ``libcmt.lib``,
instead of ``msvcrt.lib``, rather than figure out the necessary
manifest magic.
