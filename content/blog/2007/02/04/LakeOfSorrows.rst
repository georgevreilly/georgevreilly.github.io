This is the second mystery featuring Nora Gavin,
an American forensic pathologist living in Ireland.
The body of a ritually murdered Iron Age man is found
preserved in a bog, and Gavin is called in to examine the body.
Shortly thereafter, another similarly murdered body is found
in the bog, but this one is wearing a wristwatch.

Hart writes lean, clear prose, with believable characters,
and a not-completely improbable plot.
Her Irish characters sound and act like Irish people,
rather than refugees from a Lucky Charms outtake.

My main complaint with this book and its predecessor,
`Haunted Ground`_, is that all of the characters are damaged,
limping through life, struggling with depression or anger.
There's something wrong with a cheerful mystery,
but these are a bit grim. This book ends on a positive note, however.
