I got a reply from Maria Cantwell's office, regarding the email that I sent
about `Attacking Iran`_. Clearly no brain cells were used in sending out
this form response.

    Dear Mr. Reilly,

    Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns for the development of
    nuclear weapons in Iran.  I appreciate hearing from you on this important
    issue.

    As you may know, international nuclear inspectors continue to monitor
    whether Iran is developing nuclear weapons.  Such a program would be in
    contravention to the nuclear non-proliferation agreement that Iran has
    signed.  In November 2004, the countries of Britain, France, and Germany
    negotiated an agreement with Iran, in which Iran agreed to cancel its
    nuclear programs.  Unfortunately, Iran has recently backed away from its
    commitments.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported
    that Iran is accelerating its nuclear fuel enrichment activities and has
    failed to comply with international nuclear inspectors.  Specifically, Iran
    began resuming uranium conversion in August 2005 and then announced its
    intentions to begin research on enriching uranium in February 2006.

    On March 29, 2006, the United Nations Security Council issued a
    Presidential Statement on Iran 's nuclear programs requesting that Iran
    suspend its uranium enrichment programs within 30 days and cooperate with
    the IAEA. Iran failed to comply with this Presidential Statement.

    On May 31, 2006 the Bush Administration decided to change course and join
    diplomatic talks with Iran, along with the United Kingdom, France, and
    Germany. I believe that the United States must engage in real diplomacy
    and work with Russia, China, and other countries to deal with Iran. We
    cannot permit Iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons.

    During the debate on the Defense Authorization bill, Senator Joseph Biden
    (D-DE) introduced an amendment calling on Iran to suspend its enrichment
    program and to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The
    amendment was agreed to, with my support, in a vote of 99 to 0.

    Please be assured that I will continue to press for progress towards a
    verifiable diplomatic solution.

    Thank you again for contacting me to share your thoughts on this matter.
    Finally, you may be interested in signing up for my weekly update for
    Washington state residents. Every Monday, I provide a brief outline about
    my work in the Senate and issues of importance to Washington State.  If you

    Maria Cantwell
    United States Senator

I hate phoning politicians' offices, but clearly email isn't achieving
much.
