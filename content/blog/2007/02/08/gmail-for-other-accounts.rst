`Gmail's Mail Fetcher`_ now works for me!
As of today, I can now read my reilly.org email through Gmail,
instead of the crappy webmail interface that NetIdentity provides.
Much, much nicer.

I still prefer to read my email with a *real* email client,
like Thunderbird, but I don't have POP3 access from work.

In related news, it looks like `anyone can sign up for Gmail`_.
You no longer need to be invited.
