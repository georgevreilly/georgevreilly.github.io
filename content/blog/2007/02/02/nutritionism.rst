Michael Pollan, in a long article in last Sunday's New York Times Magazine,
writes about `Nutritionism`_

    In the case of nutritionism [an ideology], the widely shared but
    unexamined assumption is that the key to understanding food is indeed
    the nutrient. From this basic premise flow several others. Since
    nutrients, as compared with foods, are invisible and therefore slightly
    mysterious, it falls to the scientists (and to the journalists through
    whom the scientists speak) to explain the hidden reality of foods to
    us. To enter a world in which you dine on unseen nutrients, you need
    lots of expert help.

    ...\-

    Another potentially serious weakness of nutritionist ideology is that
    it has trouble discerning qualitative distinctions between foods. So
    fish, beef and chicken through the nutritionists’ lens become mere
    delivery systems for varying quantities of fats and proteins and
    whatever other nutrients are on their scope. Similarly, any qualitative
    distinctions between processed foods and whole foods disappear when
    your focus is on quantifying the nutrients they contain (or, more
    precisely, the known nutrients).

    ...\-

    But what about the elephant in the room — the Western diet? It might be
    useful, in the midst of our deepening confusion about nutrition, to
    review what we do know about diet and health. What we know is that
    people who eat the way we do in America today suffer much higher rates
    of cancer, heart disease, diabetes and obesity than people eating more
    traditional diets. (Four of the 10 leading killers in America are
    linked to diet.) Further, we know that simply by moving to America,
    people from nations with low rates of these “diseases of affluence”
    will quickly acquire them. Nutritionism by and large takes the Western
    diet as a given, seeking to moderate its most deleterious effects by
    isolating the bad nutrients in it — things like fat, sugar, salt — and
    encouraging the public and the food industry to limit them. But after
    several decades of nutrient-based health advice, rates of cancer and
    heart disease in the U.S. have declined only slightly (mortality from
    heart disease is down since the ’50s, but this is mainly because of
    improved treatment), and rates of obesity and diabetes have soared.

He concludes with some recommendations:

    To medicalize the diet problem is of course perfectly consistent with
    nutritionism. So what might a more ecological or cultural approach to
    the problem recommend? How might we plot our escape from nutritionism
    and, in turn, from the deleterious effects of the modern diet? ...
    So try these few (flagrantly unscientific)
    rules of thumb, collected in the course of my nutritional odyssey, and
    see if they don’t at least point us in the right direction.

    1. Eat food. Though in our current state of confusion, this is much
    easier said than done. So try this: Don’t eat anything your
    great-great-grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food. (Sorry, but at this
    point Moms are as confused as the rest of us, which is why we have to
    go back a couple of generations, to a time before the advent of modern
    food products.) There are a great many foodlike items in the
    supermarket your ancestors wouldn’t recognize as food (Go-Gurt?
    Breakfast-cereal bars? Nondairy creamer?); stay away from these.

    2. Avoid even those food products that come bearing
    health claims. ...

    3. Especially avoid food products containing ingredients that are a)
    unfamiliar, b) unpronounceable c) more than five in number — or that
    contain high-fructose corn syrup.None of these characteristics are
    necessarily harmful in and of themselves, but all of them are reliable
    markers for foods that have been highly processed.

    4. Get out of the supermarket whenever possible. You won’t find any
    high-fructose corn syrup at the farmer’s market; you also won’t find
    food harvested long ago and far away. What you will find are fresh
    whole foods picked at the peak of nutritional quality. Precisely the
    kind of food your great-great-grandmother would have recognized as
    food.

    5. Pay more, eat less. The American food system has for a century
    devoted its energies and policies to increasing quantity and reducing
    price, not to improving quality. There’s no escaping the fact that
    better food — measured by taste or nutritional quality (which often
    correspond) — costs more, because it has been grown or raised less
    intensively and with more care. ...

    “Eat less” is the most unwelcome advice of all, but in fact the
    scientific case for eating a lot less than we currently do is
    compelling. “Calorie restriction” has repeatedly been shown to slow
    aging in animals, and many researchers (including Walter Willett, the
    Harvard epidemiologist) believe it offers the single strongest link
    between diet and cancer prevention. ...
    To make the “eat less” message a bit more palatable, consider
    that quality may have a bearing on quantity: I don’t know about you,
    but the better the quality of the food I eat, the less of it I need to
    feel satisfied. All tomatoes are not created equal.

    6. Eat mostly plants, especially leaves. Scientists may disagree on
    what’s so good about plants — the antioxidants? Fiber? Omega-3s? — but
    they do agree that they’re probably really good for you and certainly
    can’t hurt. Also, by eating a plant-based diet, you’ll be consuming far
    fewer calories, since plant foods (except seeds) are typically less
    “energy dense” than the other things you might eat. Vegetarians are
    healthier than carnivores, but near vegetarians (“flexitarians”) are as
    healthy as vegetarians. Thomas Jefferson was on to something when he
    advised treating meat more as a flavoring than a food.

    7. Eat more like the French. Or the Japanese. Or the Italians. Or the
    Greeks. Confounding factors aside, people who eat according to the
    rules of a traditional food culture are generally healthier than we
    are. Any traditional diet will do: if it weren’t a healthy diet, the
    people who follow it wouldn’t still be around. ...
    In the case of the French paradox, it may not be the
    dietary nutrients that keep the French healthy (lots of saturated fat
    and alcohol?!) so much as the dietary habits: small portions, no
    seconds or snacking, communal meals — and the serious pleasure taken in
    eating. (Worrying about diet can’t possibly be good for you.) Let
    culture be your guide, not science.

    8. Cook. And if you can, plant a garden. To take part in the intricate
    and endlessly interesting processes of providing for our sustenance is
    the surest way to escape the culture of fast food and the values
    implicit in it: that food should be cheap and easy; that food is fuel
    and not communion. ...

    9. Eat like an omnivore. Try to add new species, not just new foods, to
    your diet. The greater the diversity of species you eat, the more
    likely you are to cover all your nutritional bases. ...
