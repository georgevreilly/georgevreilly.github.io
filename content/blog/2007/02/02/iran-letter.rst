    :alt: Attacking Iran

Via `Digby`_, a warning about the Bush Administration trying to gin up a
case for war against Iran.
`Arthur Silber`_ and `Scott Ritter`_ have things to say.

I just sent the following letter to my Senators,
`Patty Murray`_ and `Maria Cantwell`_,
my Representative, `Jim McDermott`_,
and to Senator `Russ Feingold`_.

    Senator:

    It is quite apparent that the Bush Administration is
    working up to provoking a war on Iran.
    We went through this before, in the leadup to the Iraq war in 2002.

    I hold no brief for Iran. They are bad actors in the region.
    Clearly, they have worrisome nuclear ambitions.
    And they have little love for the U.S.

    But somehow, we survived more than 40 years of Cold War against a
    far greater threat, without ever going to war with the Soviets.

    As Scott Ritter points out at
    http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070205/ritter
    a Democratically-controlled Congress will share responsibility
    with Bush should we start an unnecessary war with Iran.
    Only Congress can declare war;
    do not forfeit that right to the president again.

    Let there be hearings. Let a real case be made for war with Iran.
    And if our national security is indeed at stake, then do what you must.
    But if it is not, then shut this down now.

    There is a great moral question at stake here.
    (Never mind the logistical difficulties of starting another war
    when the Army is already stretched too thin.)
    We cannot, must not, silently acquiesce to another war.

Go, thou, and do likewise.
