A small troupe of traveling players spend a few days in the Oxford of 1434
and are nearly framed for a murder.

Frazer evokes the sights and sounds of medieval Oxford during the Corpus
Christi holiday, the hard life of traveling players, and the goings-on
of a rich merchant's household.
Amazingly enough, she almost completely avoids the colleges of Oxford.
The mystery itself is thin and occupies little of the book,
as the author prefers to concentrate on the other aspects of her tale.

Moderately entertaining.
