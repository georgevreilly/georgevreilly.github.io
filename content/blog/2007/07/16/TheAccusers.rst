*The Accusers* is one of the more recent titles in
Lindsey Davis's long-running series about
`Marcus Didius Falco`_, an informer (private detective)
in ancient Rome.
Davis's prose is slyly witty with an occasional leavening of snark.

Falco and Associates look into the death of a senator
who committed suicide after being convicted of corruption.
Was it really suicide? A complicated courtroom drama ensues.

On a par with other books in the series.
Entertaining, amusing, and plenty of plot twists.
