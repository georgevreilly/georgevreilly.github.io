This is the sequel to `Matriarch`_, one of the very first books I reviewed,
back in December 2006.

As with its predecessor, this book does not admit of an easy summary
and it too should be read `in sequence`_.

The themes include alien contact, ecocide, genocide,
the undesirable consequences of immortality,
and the clash of personalities.
The plot is character-driven and fast-paced, with multiple twists.
