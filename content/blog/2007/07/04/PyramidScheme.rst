*Pyramid Scheme* is another humorous science fiction novel from the authors of
`Rats, Bats, and Vats`_ and
`The Rats, The Bats, & The Ugly`_.

An alien probe, in the shape of a pyramid, lands in Chicago
and starts growing rapidly.
It captures some of the people in the vicinity
and sends them into an alternate universe,
where most of them die within hours.
A handful survive and start to thrive.
The new universe contains the Greek and Egyptian gods
and characters from Greek mythology,
including the ever-untrustworthy Odysseus.

The plot is too silly to explain further,
but it's an enjoyable romp,
as the core characters triumph over the odds.
