After panning `Prior Bad Acts`_ and `Adept`_, I needed to read a good book.
I found it in `John le Carré`_'s classic cold war spy novel,
`Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy`_.

George Smiley, quiet, unassuming, pudgy, and easily overlooked,
is recently retired from the Service
(MI6, the British intelligence agency).
He is secretly tasked with finding a mole
in the highest reaches of the Service,
run by Karla, a KGB spymaster.
The mole can only be one of the four most senior men.
Smiley begins piecing together the evidence
from stolen files, interrogating former colleagues,
and re-examining his own past.

This is not at all the typical spy novel,
full of fast-paced car chases and shootouts.
The book is subtle, cerebral, and character-driven,
with little action.
Smiley may not be capable of running across the street,
but he can certainly run a sting operation.

Le Carré masterfully weaves a web of deceit and intrigue,
which enmeshes the reader.
He depicts a world of moral ambiguity,
painted in shades of gray,
where motives are murky.

Highly recommended.
