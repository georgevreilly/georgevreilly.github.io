Michael Forsythe is an illegal immigrant from Northern Ireland,
working for a crime boss in Harlem in 1992.
When he sleeps with his boss's girlfriend,
he and three others are set up to take the fall for a drug bust in Mexico.
He breaks out of a hellhole prison,
losing a foot and his friends along the way,
and makes his way back to New York to exact revenge.

McKinty writes lush, atmospheric prose,
with a good turn in dialog.
Forsythe grows from a bright, feckless teenager,
with a future ahead of him in crime,
into a hardened, vengeful survivor.
