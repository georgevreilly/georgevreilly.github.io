Cozi is `hiring <http://www.cozi.com/about/careers.aspx>`_.
We have positions for Developers and Web Developers.

We're a small Web 2.0 startup, based in the `Smith Tower`_ in downtown Seattle.
Our `Cozi Central`_ product is groupware for families:
it helps parents manage their own and their kids' schedules,
shopping lists, and reminders, from computers, PDAs, and mobile phones.

If you're interested, let me know.

*Update*: we have some non-developer positions too.
