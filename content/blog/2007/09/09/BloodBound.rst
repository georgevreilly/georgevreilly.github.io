Mercy Thompson, heroine of `Moon Called`_, is back.
Mercedes the Volkswagen mechanic is a shape-shifter
living in the Tri-Cities of Eastern Washington.

A new vampire is in town, one who also happens to be
a demon-possessed sorceror, and he's killing indiscriminately.
The other vampires and the local werewolf pack need
to shut him down before the general public catches on.
In the end, Mercy's skills are needed to track him down
and put an end to him.
Along the way, she has two werewolves and a vampire
paying court to her.
Mercy is fiercely independent and less than thrilled at this.

Another enthralling urban fantasy from Patricia Briggs.
Recommended.
