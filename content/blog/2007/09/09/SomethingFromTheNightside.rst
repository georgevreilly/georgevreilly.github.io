the dark, mysterious, sleazy place under the city of London,

Taylor exiled himself five years ago.
Now he's making a precarious living as a private eye in London.
A distraught businesswoman hires him to find her teenage daughter,
who was last seen heading for Nightside.
Taylor finds the girl alright,
and he finds plenty of trouble along the way.

Entertaining fantasy noir.
