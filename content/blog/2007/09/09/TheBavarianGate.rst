A loose sequel to `The Lion of Farside`.
The newly widowed Curtis Macurdy has returned to Earth in 1933.
He heads west to a lumber town in Oregon where he becomes a sheriff's deputy.
After Pearl Harbor, he enlists in the Army and quickly becomes a paratrooper.
Despite showing great promise (and having been a general on Yuulith!),
Macurdy refuses to be sent to Officer Training School.
After some hair-raising adventures in North Africa that he only survives
due to his Yuulith-trained magical abilities,
he is recruited by the Office of Strategic Services
(the forerunner of the CIA).
The Nazi's Occult Bureau has established contact with aliens
via a dimensional gate in Bavaria.
Macurdy is sent in as a spy amongst the Nazis,
and later returns to destroy the gate.

A strange, disjointed book.
The section in Oregon seems wholly unneccessary.
The paratrooper section seems mostly to have been
thrown in as the author underwent airborne training later in the war.
The alien voitar are from a distant part of Yuulith;
otherwise this book has almost no ties to the previous book.
