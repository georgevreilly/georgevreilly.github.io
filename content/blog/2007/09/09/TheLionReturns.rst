Sequel to `The Bavarian Gate`_.
Again widowed, Macurdy returns to Yuulith from Earth.
He meets up with Vulkan, a bodhisattva in the avatar of a wild boar,
who is troubled by portents of trouble coming across the ocean.
The voitar are invading the continent of Yuulith
and Macurdy must pull together the disparate nations
to fight back against the brutal voitar.

The series works better in a swords-and-sorcery milieu
than in 20th century Earth, and this book is more enjoyable
than its predecessor.
Overall, the series is rather clumsily written.
Emma said the books tell you stuff rather than showing you.
