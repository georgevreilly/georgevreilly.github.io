This year is the 21st anniversary of the Northwest AIDS Walk.
A whole generation has passed.
Twenty years ago, AIDS was a gay man's disease and a death sentence.
The Reagan administration was just beginning to
acknowledge the existence of AIDS,
half a decade after it had first been recognized and 
thousands had died.

AIDS is still a serious problem, but the development of antiretroviral 
drugs a decade ago means that people with HIV
are living longer, healthier lives than before.
More than 1 million Americans are now living with HIV/AIDS:
9,000 of them in King County.
40,000 people are infected every year,
and most new infections are among African-Americans.
The U.S. is getting off relatively lightly:
about one-quarter of the adults in southern Africa have HIV!

The Lifelong AIDS Alliance provides a variety of services to those living 
with HIV/AIDS in Washington State.
LLAA cooks more than 100,000 fresh meals each year,
provides case management for 946 people,
assists 800 people with housing resources,
packs 30,000 grocery bags,
and distributes condoms and safe-sex information to high-risk populations.

I've walked in the AIDS Walk every year since 1992 and I've raised 
thousands of dollars for AIDS.
Please help me raise money again for `this year's walk`_ on Saturday, 
September 29th.
I aim to raise at least $1000.

You can sponsor me by going to http://www.georgevreilly.com/aidswalk.

I thank you, the Lifelong AIDS Alliance thanks you,
and the people you'll be helping thank you.

*Note*: Emma and I are having a fundraising barbecue on
Sunday 23rd September.
Email me for more details.
