I was just watching the Colbert Report and Sam Waterston was on,
touting `Unity08`_.
Except that both he and Colbert kept pronouncing it as
*Unity-oh-Eight dot com*, not *Unity-zero-Eight dot com*.
I knew what they meant of course, but I decided to see
what was at `Unityo8`_.
Naturally, they don't own the domain, despite having existed for more than a year.
Such incompetence.

As for their third-way platform, I expect that they would
act as a spoiler, most likely splitting the Democratic vote,
as Nader (cursed be his name) did in 2000.
Their list of `sponsors`_ is quite suspect too.
`Irregular Times`_ lists a number of problems with Unity08.
