Sequel to `Living Dead in Dallas`_.

Sookie's vampire boyfriend, Bill, has gone missing
and seems to have had an affair with another vampire.
To get him back—and she's not sure she wants him back—she must go undercover
among the vampire glitterati of Jackson, Mississippi.
She retrieves him eventually, but not without some physical battering,
and emotional upheaval as she finds herself 
attracted to another vampire and a very nice werewolf.

Entertaining, often funny, occasionally touching.
Harris offers an amusing and original explanation
for why Elvis continues to be sighted.
