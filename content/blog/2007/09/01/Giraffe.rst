This is a very strange novel, which I abandoned half way through.
The `last book that I abandoned`_ was simply wretched in every way,
but this one is beautifully written.

*Giraffe* is also utterly, maddeningly pointless.
It tells the (apparently) true story of the slaughter of a large herd
of captive giraffes at a Czechoslovakian zoo in 1973.
The main narrator is a hemodynamicist
escorting a newly captured herd of giraffes
as they are transported by barge from Hamburg to the Czech zoo.
He is a depressed-sounding young man with little liking for the
Communist regime, mired in an existential ennui.
The entire book reads like a dream sequence,
based on the half that I read and the half that I flicked through,
hoping against hope that it would finally repay the time
that I had spent on it.
Some reviewers clearly loved it, but it did nothing for me.
Altogether a very odd book for a Scot born in 1968 to have written.
