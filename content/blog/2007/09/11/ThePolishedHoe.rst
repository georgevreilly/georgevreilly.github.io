Mary-Mathilda has been the mistress of Bellfeels,
a plantation owner in Bimshire (a lightly fictionalized Barbados),
since her early teens.
One night, she calls the police to confess a crime.
Sargeant, who has silently loved her since they were children,
takes her Statement over the course of a very long, discursive night.
A night in which many ugly secrets bubble to the surface.
Secrets about Mary-Mathilda's past,
secrets about the English elite who ruled pre-War Bimshire,
secrets about the plantation:
secrets that Sargeant doesn't really want to hear.

An odd, meandering novel that moves slowly,
but nonetheless held my attention.
