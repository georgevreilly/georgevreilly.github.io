A certain subgenre has grown up over the last few years.
Call it "vampire mystery" or `urban fantasy`_ or "horror fiction" or
"paranormal romance".
Stories set in a world that looks a lot like ours, but
witches, vampires, werewolves, and other creatures exist among us,
sometimes openly, sometimes not.
The creatures have complex personal lives,
generally sticking together with their own kind
and treating gingerly with the other paranormals.
The hero (often, heroine) is not necessarily human
and has close friends, lovers, and enemies who are
vampires or werewolves or witches.
In the best hardboiled tradition,
the stubborn hero has a smarter mouth than is good for them.

`Buffy`_ is the best-known example on TV, but there are many books.
`Laurell K. Hamilton`_'s *Anita Blake* series;
`Jim Butcher`_'s *Dresden Files*;
`Kim Harrison`_'s *Rachel Morgan* books;
`C. E. Murphy`_'s *Walker Papers*;
and so on.

Add `Patricia Briggs`_ to that list.
Mercedes Thompson is an auto mechanic living in
the Tri-Cities of Eastern Washington.
A shape-shifter who can transform herself into a coyote,
she was raised by werewolves in Eastern Montana.

When the daughter of her neighbor, the Alpha of the local werewolf pack,
is kidnapped, Mercy gets involved.
A fast-paced, complicated, bloody plot laced with werewolf politics ensues,
as Mercy tracks down the kidnappers.
