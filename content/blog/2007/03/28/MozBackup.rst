Scott Hanselman wrote today about `family backup plans`_
and alerted me to `MozBackup`_.
MozBackup can backup all of your crucial Firefox and
Thunderbird files to a single, consolidated PCV file,
saving you the hassle of figuring out where all the
crucial files live on your hard disk.

You still have to back that PCV file up to a CD or an external drive,
but now you have one file to back up instead of several dozen,
scattered across several different, deeply hidden directory trees
with non-obvious names.

Speaking of `backup plans`_, I need a better one for myself.
I regularly do a manual backup of my crucial data
to a rotating set of thumbdrives
and move them by hand between my different computers.
I'm not doing a good job of backing up my photos,
only sporadically backing them up by hand to external USB drives.

I really need:

* a centralized server at home, so that all the other computers can do a 
  network backup to it;
* *automated backup* on a regular basis;
* to take some of those backups offline â€” or better still, offsite;
* a private Subversion_ server on the Internet, so I can keep most of my 
  crucial files under version control, obviating the need to move them
  by hand from computer to computer.
