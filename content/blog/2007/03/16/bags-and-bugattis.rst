The Ides of March rolls around again, and it's my birthday.
I am now the `Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything`_.

Emma gave me the messenger bag shown here.
I picked it up from `R.E.Load Baggage`_.
The 17" `MacBook Pro`_ is too large for my previous shoulder bag.

The video clip below shows the `Bugatti Veyron`_,
the world's fastest and most expensive street-legal car
attempting to hit its top speed of 253\-mph.
I guess I'm *not* getting one of these for my birthday.
