In `Damn Right We're Angry`_, Paul Waldman lets loose with a long list of 
why progressives are justifiably angry with what's happened to the US over 
the last few years:

    We’re angry because of what has happened to our country, because of how 
    we’ve been treated, and because of the innumerable crimes the 
    conservatives have committed. We’re angry at the president, we’re angry 
    at the Congress, we’re angry at the news media. And we have every right 
    to be.

    Yes, we’re angry at George W. Bush. We’re not angry at him because of 
    who he sleeps with, and we’re not angry at him because we think he 
    represents some socio-cultural movement we didn’t like 40 years ago, or 
    because he hung out with a different crowd than we did in high school. 
    We’re angry at him because of what he’s done.

    ...\-

    Yes, we’re angry about Iraq, and we may be for the rest of our lives. ...

    We’re angry that when we talk about ending this monstrous war, the 
    soulless hypocrites who are glad to send more and more men and women to 
    be scarred and maimed and killed in Iraq have the gall to accuse us of 
    not “supporting the troops.” We’re angry that people whose actions 
    exhibit nothing but contempt for freedom and liberty and justice, who 
    wouldn’t know real patriotism if it came up and smacked them across the 
    face, pin a little flag on their lapel and say that we’re the ones who 
    hate America.

    ...\-

    We’re angry that America may now be the only country in the world in 
    which torture is an officially sanctioned policy, proclaimed proudly in 
    public. ...

    And we’re angry that Bush has made our nation so hated around the 
    world. We’re angry that the next time a Democrat gets elected, most of 
    their time will be spent cleaning up the god-awful mess Bush has made 
    of everything.

    We’re angry that we and our children and our grandchildren will have to 
    keep paying off the nation’s debt, which now stands at nearly $9 
    trillion. We’re angry because every other industrialized country in the 
    world has a single-payer health care system that works, and we pay more 
    for ours than any of them, yet we have 45 million people with no health 
    insurance. We’re angry that the insurance companies have convinced 
    their obedient servants in Congress that the Rube Goldberg perpetual 
    paperwork machine we have now is somehow “the best health care in the 
    world” and preferable to a system in which you go to your doctor, get 
    treated and go home, without having to fill out 10 forms and get down 
    on your knees before the gods of the HMO bureaucracy to get a partial 
    repayment minus your deductible and your co-pay.

    We’re angry that the federal government is brimming with people 
    fundamentally opposed to the mission of the agencies over which they 
    preside, the anti-environmentalists who run the Interior department, 
    the mining company lobbyists in charge of mine safety and the 
    union-busters in charge of worker safety. 

`Read it`_ for yourself.
