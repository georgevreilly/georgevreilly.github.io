I ordered a 17" `Mac Book Pro`_ on Friday night.
It shipped from Shanghai on Monday and arrived at work this morning.
Scha-weet! And spendy.

I've been busy ramping up all day.
I estimate that my total lifetime usage of Macs was about one day
before today.
I definitely have some new habits to learn.

So far, I've installed `Mac Vim`_,
`Firefox`_ (browser),
`Camino`_ (browser),
`Thunderbird`_ (email),
`Quicksilver`_ (fast launch utility),
`Witch`_ (window switcher),
`AntiRSI`_ (RSI preventer),
`Adium`_ (multi-protocol chat),
`Skype`_ (Internet telephony),
`Remote Desktop Connection`_ (connecting to Windows desktops),
`StuffIt Expander`_ (for classic archives), and
`KeePassX`_ (password manager).

Some of these have built-in equivalents of course, but I'm using these
for compatibility with my existing Windows and Linux setups and data
(e.g., Thunderbird, KeePassX) or because I'm too entrenched to change
(Vim).
