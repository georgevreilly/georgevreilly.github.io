*Blown Away* is the latest in Ford's series about Frank Corso,
investigative reporter, bestselling author, and abrasive jerk.
Corso is pressed by his publisher to look into a year-old case in Pennsylvania
where a victim was sent into a bank with a bomb chained around his neck,
then blown up in the parking lot when he was pinned down by the police.
Corso's questions provoke a couple of assaults upon himself,
and then the FBI drag him to Los Angeles,
where a series of identical bank robberies is taking place.

This is a fast-paced, well-written thriller,
with a somewhat improbable plot,
culminating in a harrowing finale.

Recommended.
