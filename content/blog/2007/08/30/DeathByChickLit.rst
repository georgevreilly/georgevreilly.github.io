Lola Somerville, Brooklyn author,
recently married to geek-hottie Doug
(now *there's* a demographic I can relate to),
and best friend of hipster Annabel,
starts tripping over bodies of chick lit writers.
Someone is winnowing the chick lit bestsellers list
and Lola feels compelled to find the killer.

This gentle parody is a cross between chick lit and Nancy Drew.
Although happily married, Lola is as insecure and neurotic as ever.
No longer worried about getting Mr. Perfect,
she's more concerned about whether she's ready for a baby
and whether her book will ever do well.

Light-hearted and mildly amusing.
