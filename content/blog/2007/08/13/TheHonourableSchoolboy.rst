The second novel of le Carré's *Karla Trilogy*,
following `Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy`_
and preceding `Smiley's People`_.

The "Circus" (MI6) is in sorry shape after the mole "Gerald" was unmasked.
`George Smiley`_, now head of the Circus, must go on the offense.
They find a trail of money leading to a Hong Kong businessman, Drake Ko.
Jerry Westerby, a newspaper reporter and occasional agent,
is sent out to Hong Kong to shake Ko's tree.

Smiley is a secondary character here.
Jerry is the honourable schoolboy of the title,
a big, bluff, middle-aged aristocrat
and second-rate newspaper hack.
Jerry travels all over South-East Asia,
against the backdrop of the fall of Saigon,
in his efforts to track down leads.
The half-crazy pilots that he encounters in the jungle
evoke the world of `Joseph Conrad`_.

Jerry himself becomes increasingly unhinged as he becomes
obsessed with Ko's roundeye mistress, Lizzie Worthington,
to the great alarm of his Circus minders,
with ultimately tragic results.

Highly recommended.
