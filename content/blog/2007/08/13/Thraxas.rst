Thraxas is an middle-aged minor sorceror and retired warrior,
who is entirely too fond of the bottle, his grub, and the racetrack.
He long ago fell from grace at the palace in the city of Turai
and now makes ends meet by discreet private investigations.
He is occasionally aided by Makri, a gladiator-turned-barmaid and would-be 
university student, who happens to be part Orc, part Elf, and half human.

This book was published as two separate novels in Britain,
*Thraxas* and *Thraxas and the Warrior Monks*.
The plots are fairly forgettable, but fun while you read them
and move along at a good clip with jokes thrown in.
