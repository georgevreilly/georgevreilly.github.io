Last night, I unwittingly bought some habenero peppers when I was shopping 
for ingredients for `Afghan Chicken`_.
They tasted hot, but not too hot, when I nibbled a couple of small pieces.
I cut them up with my bare hands.
By the time that I was finished, my fingers felt as if they had been burned!
As if I had burned them with steam or something.
It took several hours for the pain to go away.
Fortunately, I didn't rub my eyes or more delicate mucous membranes,
while I still had the habenero oils on my skin.

The chicken itself was fine: not too spicy.
The cooked-up onion marinade had a definite burn,
but adding fresh yogurt kept it manageable for the spice wimps.

I'll pay more attention to what I'm buying in future.
