I recently learned about `string pods`_ and `chain pods`_.
In essence, they are pocket-sized monopods.
You screw a six-foot string into the tripod socket of your camera,
step on the other end of the string,
and pull it taut.
The tension on the string reduces camera shake.

`My string pod tutorial`_ shows how I made the string pod,
as well as some before and after shots.

Before now, I used to try to find a handy surface or wall
to brace the camera, when taking photos without flash.
Often there isn't such a surface.
I have a little 3-inch pocket tripod that I carry with me all the time,
but I haven't used it much.

A Flick thread on `low-light, no flash, hand-held photography`_
makes several good suggestions.
The best is to set the 2-second timer,
which gives the camera a chance to stabilize
after pressing the trigger.
