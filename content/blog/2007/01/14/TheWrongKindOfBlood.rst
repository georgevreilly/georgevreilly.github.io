Ed Loy has returned to Dublin after 20 years in Los Angeles
to bury his mother.
An old friend asks him to find her missing husband.
This sends him into a viper's nest of corruption among
property developers and upwardly mobile gangsters,
as he confronts the demons of his past.

Loy, after his long, self-imposed exile,
finds a very different Dublin to the one that he left.
The economic miracle known as the `Celtic Tiger`_
has wrought huge changes over the last 15 years,
catapulting Ireland from a country
that haemorrhaged emigrants
to having one of the highest living standards in the world.
The less desirable consequences include
out-of-control house prices, enormous traffic congestion,
and a gap between rich and poor that rivals the United States'.

I emigrated from Ireland in 1989, so `I experience
</blog/2007/01/14/TaFuckAllGaeilgeAgam.html>`_
some of Loy's culture shock whenever I visit Ireland.

Hughes has written a taut, effective hard-bitten detective novel,
which casts a critical eye on modern Ireland.
Ed Loy, in the best PI tradition, has a perverse streak,
a little attitude problem, and a fondness for drink and women.
Well-worn elements, but not often applied to the mean streets
of Dublin's gated communities.
