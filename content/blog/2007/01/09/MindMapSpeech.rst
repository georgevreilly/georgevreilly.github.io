I gave a speech at `Freely Speaking Toastmasters`_ this evening,
on Mind Mapping. You can see a shrunken version of the mind map for
the speech above. Clicking on it will lead to the full-sized image.

I created the mind map with `Freemind`_.
Here's the `speech mindmap`_ as a Freemind document.

I thought the speech went quite well.
It was speech #8, `working with visual aids`_.
I drew a partial version of my speech's mind map on a white board ahead of time,
and drew a couple of mind maps on a flip chart during the speech.
The second one was a two-minute brainstorming session
on increasing club membership.

I had intended to record the speech and turn it into a podcast,
but I forgot.

Usually, I write out the words of the speech ahead of time,
rehearse it several times, fine-tuning the words,
and then deliver the speech from a handful of notes.

This time, I never wrote down anything except the mind map itself.
I did have a printout of the map in front of me,
though I didn't refer to it often.
