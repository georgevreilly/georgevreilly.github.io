This recipe comes from my mother, who has used it for many years.
I added the soaking of the fruit in hot water.

Fruit-based Christmas cake is considered a treat in Ireland,
not a thing of horror, as so many Americans regard it.

=========   ==============================
12 ozs      butter
12 ozs      brown sugar
12 ozs      plain flour
1 tsp       salt
12 ozs      raisins
12 ozs      `sultanas`_
6 ozs       dried currants
6 ozs       candied peel
4 ozs       `glacé cherries`_
4 ozs       walnuts, optional, cut in half
2 ozs       `angelica`_, optional
4-5         eggs
=========   ==============================

Makes one round cake in a 10"x"3"-tall cake pan
or two cakes in 8"x3" pans".
 
Note: For the raisins,
you can substitute stoned `muscat raisins`_
or valentias if you wish.
Be careful to only take the stone and leave the flesh.
I usually cut them in half as they are big.

Place the fruit in a mixing bowl
and cover with boiling water.
Add about half a cup of whiskey or brandy.
Stir well.
Let the fruit soak overnight, stirring occasionally.
Keep covered.
It will plump up considerably.
An hour before baking, drain the fruit thoroughly.
Be sure to press out excess liquid.

Line tin with buttered greaseproof paper (two layers)
on sides and bottom.
Must be 3" taller than tin.
Put brown paper around outside to prevent burning:
prevents base being burned.

Cream butter and sugar very well: about 10 minutes in a beater.
Whip eggs together and sieve flour.
Gradually add eggs slowly and alternate with some flour
(it might be better to do this by hand to prevent curdling).
Add rest of dry ingredients.
Lastly add soaked fruit.
Stir and pour into lined tin.

Before putting into oven, make a 3"-wide scoop in center of top;
glaze cake with some milk to prevent cracking.
Cake takes approx 4 hours to cook.
If getting too brown,
put some paper on top for last half hour.
Don't open oven before that.

Cook on 2nd shelf from the bottom.
My oven in Dublin I cook at
300F for 1½ hours and reduce
to 250F for 2½ hours.

While still warm, pierce top several times and pour in a little whiskey.
Leave in tin overnight.

The cake may be made several months ahead of time.
Keep in an airtight container.
Every few weeks, drizzle a little whiskey on it to keep it moist.

In mid-December, the cake should be covered with
a layer of `marzipan`_ icing.
It should then be decorated with a layer of `royal icing`_.

that I made in 2007: `making the cake`_, `making marzipan`_,
and `icing the cake`_.
