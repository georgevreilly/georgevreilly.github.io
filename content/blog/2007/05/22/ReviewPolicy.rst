    :alt: A Review of literature

Up to now, all of the books that I've reviewed have been ones that I have 
bought or borrowed.

A few weeks ago, I was contacted by a publicity manager at `HarperCollins`_
in reference to my review of `The Wrong Kind of Blood`_.
She offered to send me a copy of the next book in the series
if I would be willing to review it on my site.
No strings were attached.
I agreed. The review will follow in a later post.

It's time for me to establish a formal review policy,
so as to maintain transparency.

Review Policy
=============

I write reviews in my limited spare time.
If you want me to review a book or a product,
please use the *E-mail* link elsewhere on this page to contact me.

* I may decline to review the product.
* If I agree, I will require a review copy,
    which is mine to keep.
    If you require return of the review copy (i.e., a loaner),
    you must make that clear before sending it to me,
    and you pay for return shipping.
* I will not accept payment. The review is free.
* I will not accept restrictions on what I can say:
    if I don't like the product, I will write a lukewarm or negative review.
* No non-disclosure agreements or other contracts which
    restrict my freedom to write a review.
* My review will disclose that I received a review copy.
* I make no guarantees about timeliness,
    but I will try to post a review within a month
    of receiving the review copy.
* If for some reason, I decide not to review the product,
    I will let you know as soon as possible.
* Reviews are copyright Â© George V. Reilly.
    I reserve the right to post my review on other sites.
* You have the right to reprint part or all of my review
    in your promotional materials,
    provided that you do not misrepresent my conclusions.
    I require attribution and a link to my website,
    `www.GeorgeVReilly.com <http://www.georgevreilly.com/>`_.
    I appreciate notification.
* I am not `DPReview.com`_. I write short, pithy reviews,
    not exhaustive ones.
* I mark on a range of 0 to 5 stars, in half-star increments.
    I almost never give out 4.5 or 5.0.
    Most reviews get 3-4 stars, but that's because
    I tend to review things that I expect I will enjoy.

This policy was initially posted on 2007/05/21.
Revision 1.0.
