No good deed goes unpunished might be the motto of this
sequel to `Rats, Bats, and Vats`_.

In the previous book, a motley assortment of grunts
destroyed a hive of the alien invaders.
The military establishment don't really appreciate being
shown up as incompetent buffoons,
and do their best to persecute and prosecute
the human leading the grunts,
as well as the military intelligence major
who spotted what they were up to and sent in help.

Our heroes are forced into a confrontation with the establishment.
It should be no surprise who comes out on top.

Another fun book from Freer and Flint,
combining humor and social satire with a deft touch.
