Microsoft announced today that it was `buying aQuantive`_ for $6.1 billion.
I work for `Atlas Solutions`_, a division of aQuantive, so I will once
again be an employee of Microsoft when the deal closes.

    I, for one, welcome our new corporate `overlords`_.

More truthfully, I can't honestly say that I'm overjoyed
to be part of the Borg again.
Anyone who's ever read `MiniMsft`_ realizes that many MS employees
find Microsoft to be deeply dysfunctional.

Atlas has a pretty good corporate culture and a sane work-life balance.
I've heard plenty today about our people are our greatest asset
and that Microsoft will be mostly leaving things alone.

At this point, it's impossible to say how the acquisition will change
Atlas and aQuantive.
I would characterize the response of my colleagues as cautious optimism.

I live in interesting times.
