Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority, died today.
As an atheist, I don't believe in hell,
but if it existed, a thoroughgoing shit like Falwell
would surely be headed there.
Falwell was a liar, a hate-monger, a parasite, and a crook.

    “The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God 
    will not be mocked. And when we destroy 40 million little innocent 
    babies, we make God mad. I really believe that the Pagans, and the 
    abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are 
    actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People 
    For the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America. 
    I point the finger in their face and say, ‘You helped this happen.’”
    
    -- Falwell, September 2001
