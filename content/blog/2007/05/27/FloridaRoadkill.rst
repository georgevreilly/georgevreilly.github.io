The book that introduces `Serge A. Storms`_,
the hyperactive serial killer,
and his stoner sidekick, Coleman.

The frenzied plot follows a large cast of characters
chasing $5 million of drug money down Florida to the Keys.
Most of them are Unnice People who will come to
well-deserved bad ends.

Dorsey is not in control of his plot.
Random flashbacks lay down the backstory for newly introduced characters.
The plot jumps about with wild abandon,
revving on all cylinders.
Somehow it comes together at the end,
with some funny moments along the way.

(I read the latest book, `Hurricane Punch`_, last month.
It looks like the next few books continue to follow the $5 million.)
