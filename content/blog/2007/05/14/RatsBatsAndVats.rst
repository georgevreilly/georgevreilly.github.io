A bunch of grunts, trapped behind enemy lines, wreak havoc on the hive of 
the Magh invaders.
No ordinary grunts these, they include a dozen `uplifted`_ rats and bats,
a vat-grown human sous-chef turned conscript,
and the rescued daughter of a very rich Shareholder.
The rats revel in Shakespearean names and ribaldry.
The bats have stage-Oirish personas, socialist leanings,
and expertise with explosives.

Due to forceshield technology,
they're fighting a World War I-style
trench war on the planet Harmony and Reason,
The generals, like the rest of the ruling Shareholder class,
are effete and inept.
Think `Blackadder goes Forth`_.

A fairly amusing satire of human mores.
