We saw the `movie`_ last week and I remarked that I had never read any of 
`the Chronicles of Narnia`_ books, so Emma dug out her copies.

The book is old-fashioned and innocent.
It reminds of some of the British books
that I read in my childhood, such as `the Famous Five`_.

By way of an enchanted wardrobe,
four plucky human children fall into a parallel world,
where they are acclaimed as saviors, fulfilling a prophecy.
They quickly fall afoul of the evil tyrant, the White Witch,
but make their way to Aslan, the noble lion,
who eventually saves the day after a noble sacrifice.

Indeed a classic children's tale.
