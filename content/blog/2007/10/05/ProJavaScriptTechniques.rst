At `Cozi.com`_, we use the `jQuery`_ JavaScript library to do all kinds of
complex and wonderful DHTML and Ajax tricks in our web client.
Extremely powerful, very elegant: I commend it to your attention.

John Resig is the lead developer on the jQuery team.
This book is *not* about jQuery, though if you work your way through it,
you'll be well equipped to understand the jQuery source code.

This book covers modern JavaScript techniques,
in particular, object-oriented JavaScript,
unobtrusive DOM manipulation, Ajax, and cross-browser warts.
It covers a lot of ground and shows the underpinnings of
many of the popular JavaScript libraries that power Web 2.0 sites,
showing uses of jQuery, Scriptaculous, Dojo, Prototype, and more.
His examples are clean and well-chosen.

It's a good book and I learned a great deal from it.
It's not as good a book as it could have been.
The editing is sloppy and there are too many typos.
Resig fails to follow Strunk's dictum, `omit needless words`_:
the writing is clumsy and wordy.
Inline ``<code>`` should be typeset in a distinct font
in a programming book.
Finally, no one should talk about consuming `JSON`_
without mentioning `browser security`_.
