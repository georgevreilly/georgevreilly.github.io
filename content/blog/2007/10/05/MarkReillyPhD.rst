My little brother, Mark Reilly aka the `Alien Resident`_,
successfully defended his doctoral dissertation on Tuesday
and may now be addressed as "Dr. Reilly."

He studied part-time at the `European Graduate School`_
in New York City, while juggling several jobs.
His doctorate is in Media and Communications
and the topic was *Propaganda of the Dead: Terrorism and Revolution*,
which he picked *before* 9/11.

He is only the second PhD in the family.
My uncle `Pat Deasy`_ was the first.

Congratulations, Mark!
