A gritty noir set in the western Irish city of Galway.
Jack Taylor used to be in the guards (police) as a young man,
but nowadays he's usually found at the bottom of a bottle.
He makes a little money by finding things.
One day, a distraught mother asks him to prove that her
teenaged daughter did not commit suicide.
He is reluctant to take the case,
fearing (rightly) that it will require too much of him.
Jack struggles mightily with his alcoholism,
and both the case and his drinking take a toll on him and
his network of friends.

Terse and atmospheric, Bruen conjures up a Galway that is half gone,
of old-fashioned pubs and dingy travelers' hotels
threatened by the changes wrought by the Celtic Tiger.
