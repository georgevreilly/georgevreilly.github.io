A fast-paced comedy about an almost likable serial killer.
Who'da thunk it?

There must be something about the coffee they serve in Florida newsrooms.
Dave Barry, Carl Hiaasen, and Tim Dorsey.
All Florida-based newsmen now known for their funny writing.

This is the first book that I've read by Dorsey.
According to Wikipedia, all of his books feature `Serge A. Storms`_,
said serial killer, though he's not always the prime character.

Serge spends much of the book racing around Florida,
chasing hurricanes with his stoner sidekick, Coleman.
He's feeling put upon because there's another serial killer on the loose.
Serge is hyperkinetic and full of enthusiasms, but easily distracted.
He specializes in the imaginative murders of jerks who annoy him,
such as the Hip-Hop Redneck who meets his end in a motel-room-sized amplifier
and the storm profiteer who cooks to death in an ice chest.

Pretty funny, in a twisted way.
