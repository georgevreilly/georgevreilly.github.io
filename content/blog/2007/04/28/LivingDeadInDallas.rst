The second of Charlaine Harris's *Dead* series
about Sookie Stackhouse, a waitress in small-town Louisiana.
A telepathic waitress. With a vampire boyfriend.

Vampires were legalized two years ago and now live openly.
Sookie is asked by the local vampire cabal to
visit their counterparts in Dallas and use her talents
to find a missing vampire.
She finds that he is being held by the Fellowship of the Sun,
a fundamentalist church that wants to take the *un* out of *undead*.

Harris portrays life in small Southern towns with a deft touch,
and she breathes fresh life, er, undeath into vampire cliches.
