Jim Butcher is best known for *The Dresden Files*,
a noirish `urban fantasy`_ series.
`Academ's Fury`_ is the second book in his
straight, high fantasy series, *The Codex Alera*, 
which is set in a world at the technological level of the Roman Empire.
Many of the characters have Roman names and I expect that we'll learn
in a future book that they are somehow descendants of marooned Romans.
This is not Earth: there are several alien races.
More importantly, every human can call upon one or more *furies*,
elemental beings with varying levels of control over
air, fire, water, wood, and metal.

Every human except one: Tavi, the teenaged hero,
who cannot call upon any furies whatsoever.
He is now a student at the elite Academy in the capital of the Realm.
The story switches between Tavi,
his aunt Isana, and her brother Bernard's lover, Amara:
all of whom come to realize that their world is under
attack by a hitherto unknown alien race, the Vord.

This is an entertaining, fast-paced novel
with plenty of swords and not a little sorcery,
which contrives to leave almost every chapter hanging from a cliff.
