    | HELP WASHINGTON STATE IMPEACH BUSH AND CHENEY
    | http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/wa 

    PLEASE JOIN US FOR AN HISTORIC DEBATE ABOUT IMPEACHMENT AND THE IRAQ 
    WAR, ON THE FLOOR OF THE WASHINGTON STATE SENATE ON THURSDAY, APRIL 
    19TH, 11:00AM. RALLY 10:00 AM.

    We have one more week to move SJM 8016 to a vote in the Washington 
    State Senate. WE CANNOT LET DEMOCRACY QUIETLY SLIP AWAY. Democratic 
    leadership can still move SJM 8016, Senator Oemig's bill to investigate 
    President Bush and Vice President Cheney, to the floor for a vote, if 
    they choose. Our intention in this campaign is to send our memorial to 
    the US Congress, not to let our bill rot in committee. We need to send 
    out a flood of calls and emails to members of the Washington State 
    Senate, asking them to move SJM 8016 to a vote. It is not enough for 
    our Senators to say that they will vote "if SJM 8016 makes it to the 
    floor." We must urge them to actively advocate for a vote, and to lobby 
    their colleagues in favor of SJM 8016 as well. We need your help this 
    week, to convince leadership to move SJM 8016 to a vote. Here is how 
    you can help:

    1. Email or call State Senate leadership today. Urge them to provide 
    leadership by moving SJM 8016 to the floor for a vote. Please tell them 
    that we can't wait until the next legislative session to call the Bush 
    Administration into account. With our current constitutional crisis, we 
    must insist that our Senators exercise their power and influence to 
    support and protect the US Constitution. Remind then that their sworn 
    oath to defend the Constitution is their only oath of office, and their 
    highest calling as a public official. The eyes of the country are upon 
    them now. SJM 8016 may be the most important legislation they vote on 
    in their entire career. The fate of our country deserves their 
    dedicated efforts now. We want our Senators to go on record now with 
    their votes. We need to send this message daily to all of leadership. 
    Here are emails for leadership:

|   brown.lisa@leg.wa.gov
|   eide.tracey@leg.wa.gov
|   chopp.frank@leg.wa.gov
|   murray.edward@leg.wa.gov
|   spanel.harriet@leg.wa.gov
|   regala.debbie@leg.wa.gov
|   rockefeller.phil@leg.wa.gov

    2. Contact Governor Christine Gregoire. Ask her to support SJM 8016 by 
    letting Democratic leadership know that she wants them to move SJM 8016 
    to a vote. Ask her kindly to honor her own oath of office and to use 
    her influence now to restore rule of law in this country. We ask her to 
    protect us from the abuses of the Bush Administration. Governor 
    Gregoire has not received enough communication on this issue. Let 
    Governor Gregoire know that opposition to SJM 8016 would show she does 
    not vigorously support the US Constitution. We want a vote on SJM 8016 
    so we know where our Legislators stand. Help us flood her office with 
    calls and emails all week long:
    (360) 902-4111
    http://www.governor.wa.gov/contact

    3. PLEASE COME TO THE STATE CAPITOL IN OLYMPIA TO ATTEND THE DEBATE ON 
    APRIL 19TH AT 11:00.

    We will gather to rally at 10:00 am (details TBA). Our March 1st rally 
    in Olympia had 500 people. Let's make this one 1,000 and let the world 
    know that democracy lives in Washington state. As the second state to 
    call for impeachment through our state legislature, we are providing 
    hope and leadership for the rest of the country. We must keep pushing 
    ahead, and keep impeachment "on the table". Every day that we make our 
    voices heard, we win another step toward restoring democracy.

    Please arrange for transportation with people from your community. We 
    are asking that people sitting in the Senate gallery wear something 
    "Guantanamo orange." (Since signs are not allowed in the Senate 
    gallery, we will alert our Senators to our presence by wearing orange.)

    Thank you for your timely response to this call to action. Your 
    commitment to the practice of Democracy has inspired me personally, and 
    given me hope that the good people of this country will prevail.

    Thank you,

    Linda Boyd Washington For Impeachmentx

    FORWARD THIS EMAIL 

I just sent the following letter:

    Senator Oemig's bill to investigate the Bush Administration is of vital 
    importance, and I urge you to bring it to the floor of the Senate for a 
    vote.

    It seems clear that the Administration lied us into an unnecessary war 
    of aggression against Iraq -- a war that has killed thousands of 
    Americans and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis; a war that has hurt our 
    national security; a war that has led us into torture and violating the 
    Geneva Conventions; a war that has alienated us from our friends and 
    allies; in short, a war that we cannot afford financially, morally, or 
    militarily.

    Surely this is enough to bring impeachment proceedings against the 
    President and the Vice President. We must have a full investigation. 
    The Oemig bill is one of the few avenues that can start this 
    investigation, since our representatives in the other Washington are 
    not minded to do so.

    I believe that this is not a distraction, but the highest service that 
    the Washington legislature can perform for the nation. The 2006 
    mid-term elections were a referendum on Iraq and on the President. He 
    has repeatedly shown his contempt for the will of the people since 
    then. In the remaining 21 months of his term, he may precipitate us 
    into yet more wars, with Iran and Syria.

    I urge you to bring Senator Oemig's bill to the floor, and to lobby 
    your colleagues to make this happen.

    Thank you.
