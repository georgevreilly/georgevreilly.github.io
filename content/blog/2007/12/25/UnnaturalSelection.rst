Gideon Oliver, the forensic anthropologist saddled with the unfortunate
nickname of the "Skeleton Detective" by the press,
is on vacation in the `Scilly Isles`_, with his wife Julie.
She's participating in a small biennial colloquium organized by an
eccentric Russian millionaire.

Naturally, he happens upon a bone fragment,
which leads him to a dismembered corpse,
who turns out to be an attendee of the previous colloquium.

The main characters are likeable and,
despite the somewhat gruesome descriptions of skeletons and postmortems,
it's an enjoyable, well-plotted whodunnit.
