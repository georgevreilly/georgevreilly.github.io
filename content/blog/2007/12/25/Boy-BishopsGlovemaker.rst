Days before Christmas 1321,
a glovemaker is murdered in the cathedral town of Exeter.
Sir Baldwin and his friend, Simon Puttock,
are asked to investigate by the Dean of the Cathedral.

Jecks juggles a complex plot with a large cast of characters,
and manages to keep them distinct and interesting,
while describing the intersection of cathedral and town life
and Christmas rituals in medieval England.
