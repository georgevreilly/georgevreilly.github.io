For centuries, carefully selected historians have mysteriously received
a book that contains only a picture of a dragon
holding a placard that says, *Drakulya*.
Three generations of one family have followed the trail of those books:
the narrator as a teenager in the 1970s,
her graduate student parents in the 1950s,
and her mother's father in the 1930s.

The trail has led them from the Pyrenees to the Balkans and Istanbul,
from libraries to monasteries to remote mountain villages.
The narrative moves back and forth across the three generations,
as each retraces their predecessors' footsteps.
Each of them find fragments of evidence that show that
Vlad the Impaler, prince of Wallachia and scourge of the invading Ottomans,
never died but lives on.

The author weaves a historical mystery against a backdrop
of Cold War Eastern Europe and the late Middle Ages,
and the never-ending clash between Christianity and Islam.
The tension builds as each generation makes its inevitable
way towards a confrontation with Dracula late in the book.

Well-written and attention-holding.
