The `G8`_ conference is about to open in Gleneagles, Scotland,
during the first week of July 2005.
Hundreds of thousands of anti-globalization activists
are heading to Edinburgh to protest.

Edinburgh cop, DI John Rebus, is about the only police officer
in Britain who's not on G8 duty.
He's been sidelined because of his propensity for pissing off
his superiors.
Instead, he gets involved in two different investigations.

A Labour MP plunged to his death from the walls of Edinburgh Castle.
Suicide or murder?
Why does Rebus keep getting the runaround from Special Branch?
A serial killer has murdered three convicted rapists:
cases that were not previously tied together because the police
thought the dead men got what they deserved.

Rebus and his partner, DS Siobhan Clarke, are prickly, stubborn cops,
morally compromised by the tacit agreements they make with men with power,
and struggling to wipe away the stains
by fighting on behalf of the dead.
The background of the G8 leads to an extraordinary week in Edinburgh.
The disparities between the powerful and the powerless
are acutely apparent.

A strong novel, but weakened by the conclusion,
where the two cases are implausibly tied together.
