Last week, we watched the `TV adaptation`_ of *Hogfather*,
which got me to re-read the book.
The book is a lot funnier.
Pratchett's written descriptions don't translate very well
to the screen.

The Hogfather is the `Discworld`_'s equivalent of Santa Claus:
a large, jolly fat man who delivers presents to children on the
longest night of the year.
The Auditors, celestial bureaucrats who take a dim view of the
messiness of human existence, decide to have the Hogfather killed.
`Death`_ takes it upon himself to deliver the presents to children instead,
while setting his granddaughter Susan on the trail of the assassin
responsible for the chaos.

One of the better Discworld novels.
Pratchett entertains us with his characteristic humor,
while ruminating on the human condition,
notably the nature of belief.

Recommended.
