Lee Donne agrees to housesit for her absent-minded grandfather.
Soon, someone is trying to scare her out of the house in Eugene, Oregon.
Buried deep in the house, she discovers why:
old photos of young men lynching a black man.
One of those men is now running for President as a third-party candidate.

Lee goes on the run and takes her story to a newspaper.
She decides to hide in plain sight, à la The Purloined Letter,
and heads to New Orleans, posing as a newspaper photographer.

Fairly entertaining and intelligent thriller.
