Female sex slaves, Ukrainian oligarchs, an obsessive silver thief,
white-collar criminals facing jail time, virus writers,
self-destructive surgeons, and the Madrid bombers,
are just some of the stories in this collection
of non-fiction writing on crime and criminals,
published in various magazines in 2005.

The book is bracketed by two pieces by James Ellroy.
In the foreword, he argues that
"true-crime writing offers a less kineticized and
more sobering set of thrills [than crime fiction]—chiefly
couched in human revelation".
In the concluding essay, he pays homage to Joseph Wambaugh,
whose writing inspired him to become a writer himself.

The other pieces are gripping articles,
ranging from the picayune—human trackers following a tiny
fraction of the illegal immigrants crossing a remote stretch
of the Rio Grande—to billion-dollar Ponzi schemes.

Recommended.
