Another book featuring `Serge A. Storms`_,
the almost-likable serial killer and amateur historian of Florida.

Serge, his coke-addict, stripper girlfriend, Sharon,
and his stoner sidekick, Coleman, rent a house on Triggerfish Lane, Tampa.
Their landlord is trying to drive out the few remaining
homeowners on the block, so that he can bulldoze it for condos.

It's quite the neighborhood.
a former millionaire who likes to test-drive expensive cars;
the psychotic Little League coach with a pit bull;
the student party house;
the South American death squad guy in hiding;
and Jim Davenport, a business consultant who gets
fired by the new management for being too honest.

Add Serge and his coterie, various bad guys,
random acts of stupidity and caprice, and stir,
then watch the mayhem.

Entertaining and more coherent than the `last book`_
that I read by Dorsey.
