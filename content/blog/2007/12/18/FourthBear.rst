DCI Jack Spratt runs the Nursery Crimes Division of the Reading, Berks police.
Investigative reporter Goldilocks is found dead,
after last being seen at the three bears' house.
The Gingerbreadman, a 7-foot psychopathic cake, is rampaging around,
randomly killing people.
Punch and Judy have moved in next door:
when they're not beating each other up, they're very good marriage counsellors.
And enormous cucumbers are exploding under mysterious circumstances.

An extremely bizarre story, replete with puns,
nursery rhymes, literary allusions, and shaggy dog stories.

Entertaining, if silly.
