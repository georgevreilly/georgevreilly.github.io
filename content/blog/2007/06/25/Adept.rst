A ninja with improbable abilities steals an ancient Tibetan artifact in London.
David Braun, hunky insurance investigator cum martial artist,
sets out to recover it with the aid of Susan Milton, an American researcher.
I can tell you no more, because I could't bring myself to finish it.

It is rare that I abandon a book halfway through once begun,
though perhaps I should more often.
*Adept* is ludicrous and clumsily written.
I found it impossible to suspend my disbelief.
