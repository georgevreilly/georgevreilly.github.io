I made my radio debut this afternoon.
The `Wild Geese Players of Seattle`_ read a couple of short excerpts on `KBCS`_
from James Joyce's `Ulysses`_, as a foretaste of the readings
we're doing next weekend.

This year's `reading`_ is of the Nausicaa chapter,
wherein Leopold Bloom reposes on a beach
to recover from clashing with the Citizen in the previous chapter,
and flirts at a distance with young Gerty MacDowell.
This is the infamous masturbation chapter
that led to *Ulysses* being banned for obscenity.

There are two readings.

* Sat, June 16th, 4:30pm,
    `Elliott Bay Bookstore`_,
    101 S. Main St,
    Seattle, WA 98101.
* Sun, June 17th, 6pm,
    `Pike Pub and Brewery`_,
    1415 First Ave,
    Seattle, WA 98101.

I will be one of several readers giving voice to Leopold Bloom.
It is likely that `Jim McDermott`_ will once again be reading with us.
