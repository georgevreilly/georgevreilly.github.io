Hitchcock Sewell is an undertaker who finds the murdered body
of a waitress on the front door of his funeral parlor,
one winter's evening during a wake.
Hitch and his weatherwoman girlfriend, Bonnie,
become obsessed with finding out who killed the waitress.

This is a fairly amusing comic mystery,
with a semi-plausible but twisted plot.
Hitch is a sympathetic character,
albeit one who drinks too much
and whose eye wanders.
