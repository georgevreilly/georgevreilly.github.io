Ninth book in the `Dresden Files <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files>`_
series of urban fantasies.

Harry Dresden is a wizard who consults with the Chicago Police on weird crimes.
Molly, the rebellious teenaged daughter of an old friend,
leads him to a horror fiction convention where the fans are being
attacked by real monsters.
Given Harry's smart mouth and talent for drawing trouble upon himself,
it's not too long before he's captured by a sadistic villain
who tries to auction him to his many enemies on eBay.
He escapes but then has to lead a rescue mission into
the land of Faerie to save Molly.

Entertaining, fast-paced, funny in places, and a little less grim
than some of the previous books in the series.
The back story continues to develop and Harry's relationships
with the ongoing characters evolve, mostly for the better.
