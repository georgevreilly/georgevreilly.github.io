Rome has never fallen to the barbarians.
The eternal city has stood for 27 centuries.
Its empire has ebbed and flowed,
from weak emperors who submitted to their co-emperors in Constantinople,
to mad ones who drain the treasury,
to conquerors who spread the might of Rome across the globe.

The premise is interesting, but the execution is weak.
The book is written in a `Micheneresque`_ style:
a series of disjointed chapters set decades or centuries apart.
The viewpoint characters usually have some connection
to the emperor of the time.
Reviewing the front matter moments ago, I see that
"sections of this book have been previously published in somewhat different form,
copyright 1989, 1991, 1994, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2003".
It's clear that it was cobbled together from a series of short stories.
