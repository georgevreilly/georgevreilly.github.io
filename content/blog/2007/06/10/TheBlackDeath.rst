After reading `Doomsday Book`_,
I decided that I wanted to know more about the Black Death.
And I learned a great deal from Ziegler's book.

The `Black Death`_ killed one-third of the population of Europe
between 1347 and 1350.
It was hugely traumatic for the people of the time,
with their profound ignorance of medicine and science,
and it was widely viewed as a punishment from God.

Ziegler spends the first few chapters showing how the plague
affected Italy, France, Germany, and other European nations,
but most of the book concentrates on England.
He describes the state of medical knowledge,
the deleterious effects on the Catholic Church's influence,
and the social and economic effects.
He recreates what it must have been like in a village
as it succumbed.

This book was first published in 1969 and seems to have been only
lightly revised in 1998. It by no means represents current thinking
amongst historians as to the causes or effects of the Black Death.
Still, the book is well written and approachable,
shedding light on the period.
