In 1912, Henry MacAlpine is a well-known British painter,
living in self-imposed exile on a small island off the coast of Brittany.
His old friend, William Naysmith, the renowned art critic
has come to see him and have his portrait painted.
Over the course of several sittings, we come to learn why MacAlpine
has left London and why he has lured Naysmith to see him.
Naysmith has misused his great influence as an art critic
to destroy several painters.

It's extremely rare to see an entire novel written in the `second person`_.
*The Portrait* is written as a series of MacAlpine's monologues addressed to 
Naysmith. It's a difficult technique, but Pears pulls it off.
He reveals the backstory with great skill,
painting verbal portraits of MacAlpine and Naysmith,
while MacAlpine paints Naysmith.
Pears is an art historian as well as a novelist,
and he marries his two interests to great effect here.
