Third in the *Walker Papers* series of `urban fantasies`_.

Joanne Walker discovered six months ago that she's a powerful shaman,
and she's not happy about it.
She's an officer in the Seattle Police Department and a former mechanic,
and being a woo-woo shaman does not fit with her self image.
She's contrary and stubborn and her determination
not to accept her new state leads to big problems.

The people that she's close to are going into comas.
In her blundering ignorance when she first came into her powers,
she unwittingly awakened an ancient power
that wants to bring the world to an end.
Joanne has to start accepting her shamanism
if she's ever going to save her friends.

Meanwhile, the new boyfriend who seems too good to be true
*is* too good to be true.
And her love-hate relationship with her boss, Captain Morrison,
becomes even more complicated.

Entertaining.
