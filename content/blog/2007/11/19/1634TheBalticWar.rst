The latest book from the `1632 series`;
this one is the long awaited sequel to `1633`_. 
The premise of the series is that through some mysterious alien event, 
a small West Virginian town is sent back to Germany in 1631,
in the middle of the Thirty Years' War,
utterly changing the course of history.
The Americans ally themselves with King Gustav Adolf of Sweden,
forming the United States of Europe.

The authors adeptly juggle a series of plots that were set in motion in the 
earlier book.
The town of Luebeck is besieged by the French and the Danes.
A diplomatic party has to be broken out of the Tower of London.
The American-built "ironside" battle ships have to float down
the Elbe and sail into the Baltic.
The power of the Spanish in the Netherlands has to be broken.

One of the better books in the series.
The authors have fun exploring the ramifications of
such a world-changing event as the effects continue
to ripple through Early Modern Europe.
