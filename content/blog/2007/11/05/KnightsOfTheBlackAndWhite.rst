The first book in a trilogy that tells the fictional history of the Templars.

The Order of the Rebirth in Sion is a secret society whose roots go back to 
Jerusalem before the time of Christ, whose members are drawn from French 
noble families. When the Pope starts the First Crusade to seize Jerusalem 
back from the Muslims, a handful of the Order tag along in the hopes of
discovering their order's secrets in the long-lost Temple of Solomon.
Under the guise of warrior-monks protecting the bandit-infested roads,
they dig deep beneath the Temple on the Mount and find the treasure
they have been looking for.

A rather hokey potboiler. Occasionally entertaining, but much too long.
