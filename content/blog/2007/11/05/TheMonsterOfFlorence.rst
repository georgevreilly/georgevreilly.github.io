Nabb's recurring character, Marshal Guarnaccia, is a non-commissioned 
officer in the `carabinieri`_, the Italian military-style police,
who is stationed in Florence.
Guarnaccia is a slow, dogged plodder and a wallflower,
who is largely overlooked by those who encounter him,
but who nonetheless gets to the bottom of mysteries.

An old case, involving a series of double murders over a twenty-year 
period, has been reopened for political reasons.
Several police officers, including the Marshal, have been seconded
to a task force.
The Marshal is troubled by what is clearly an attempt by the prosecutor
to put an unsavory pedophile into the frame, in order to close the case 
quickly, and he starts digging around, finding evidence that had long been 
overlooked or never gathered.

Somewhat confusing. I had a hard time keeping track of Sergio and Silvano
and Flavio and Fabio.
