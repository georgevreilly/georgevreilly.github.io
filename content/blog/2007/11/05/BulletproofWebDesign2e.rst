Cederholm clearly explains the CSS techniques required to build a 
"bulletproof" website: one that is robust in the face of 
text resizing, window resizing, disabled images, etc,
with minimal, semantically correct markup that works across
all the major browsers.

Anyone who's serious about building a modern website should read this book.

Cederholm builds up his examples, one step at a time,
in a clear manner. For the shorter examples, he tends to show
the entire CSS or XHTML again and again, with the latest changes 
highlighted in orange. I would have preferred him to strip out the
unneccessary repetitive material. Otherwise, great book.
