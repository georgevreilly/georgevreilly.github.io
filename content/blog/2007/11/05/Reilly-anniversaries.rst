Last week was the second anniversary of my brother Mark's wedding to Lizzy.

Next week will be the first anniversary of my sister `Michelle's wedding`_ to David.

The day after that, my parents will be flying to Egypt to celebrate the
fiftieth anniversary of their first date.

And Emma and I just got back from a three-day weekend in Astoria, Oregon,
to celebrate the tenth anniversary of our own first date.

Sheesh!
