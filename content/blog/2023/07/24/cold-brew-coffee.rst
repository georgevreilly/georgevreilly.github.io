I often enjoy cold brew coffee in summer.
I bought an `Oxo Cold Brew Coffee Maker`_ one winter
when it was on sale at Bed, Bath & Beyond.
Before that, I used a `nut milk bag`_ in a jar.
I like the Oxo and it gets high marks in many reviews,
such as `HomeGrounds`_ or `Wirecutter`_.
It's easy to use, easy to clean, and makes a good brew.

The only downside to making your own cold brew coffee
is that you must plan ahead.
You can make hot coffee in a few minutes,
but cold brew takes hours.

I have used this recipe for a number of years.
It makes a smooth, less acidic coffee.

ETA: See also `Cold Brew Coffee Recipe for French Press`_.

Ingredients
-----------

* 24 fl oz water
* 6 oz fresh *coarsely ground* coffee.
  Store-bought pre-ground coffee is too fine.

This will half-fill the Oxo jar.
It **yields about 16 fl oz** (1 pt) of cold brew coffee.
You can double the quantities in the Oxo, if you like.

Instructions
------------

* Grind the coffee beans coarsely.
* Place the ground coffee in the Oxo jar.
* Pour water through the rain sprinkler top.
* Swirl gently to ensure that all coffee grounds are wet.
  (I once followed a recipe that called for vigorous stirring.
  Never again!
  The grounds absorbed so much more water that I only got half the yield.)
* Some people put the jar in the fridge at this point.
  I don't bother.
* Wait for the coffee to brew!
  Some instructions say 12 to 24 hours.
  I usually wait 6–8 hours.
* Put the jar on the stand.
  First, make sure that the switch is *closed*.
* Place the flask under the stand.
  Push the switch down to release the brew.
* Let the cold brew coffee drain.
  This will take 10–15 minutes.
* Refrigerate the cold brew.
* Use the coffee grounds to
  `turn hydrangeas blue`_ or `exfoliate your skin`_.

Adjustments
-----------

You can vary the ratio of coffee to water and how long you steep the mixture.

Drinks
------

* 2 fl oz of cold brew
* 6 fl oz milk

`Fork in the Kitchen`_ has some suggestions
if you don't have a coffee grinder
or an Oxo maker.
