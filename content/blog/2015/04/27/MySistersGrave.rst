Twenty years after her disappearance, the body of teenager Sarah Crosswhite is found.
Her older sister Tracy, now a Seattle detective,
believes that the man convicted of Sarah's abduction was framed,
and sets out to overturn his conviction.
But some people in her hometown are not happy about this.

Dugoni is an entertaining storyteller.
The plot moves along briskly, with enough twists and turns to keep one on the hook.
However, the story was predictable and not particularly original.
