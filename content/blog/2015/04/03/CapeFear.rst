Fourteen years ago, Sam Bowden testified against Max Cady.
Now Cady is out of prison and waging a war of terror
against Sam and Carol and their children.
Cady is cunning and ruthless and sooner or later he's going to start killing them.
Bowden has always been a strong believer in the law,
but until there's proof, there's little the law can do about Cady.
Sam and Carol have to dig deeper to unearth their primal survival instincts.
