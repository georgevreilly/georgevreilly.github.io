Four long novellas about `Dalziel and Pascoe`_:
"Fat Andy" Dalziel, the crude and wily Yorkshire superintendent,
and Peter Pascoe, the university-educated, much politer detective inspector.
The stories include their first meeting and their last case,
set in the future of 2010, investigating a murder on the moon.
The stories are entertaining, combining decent plotting with good characterization.
