In 1942, Ernest Hemingway ran a counter-espionage ring
and submarine-seeking operation from Cuba.
Staffed by amateurs, it was approved by the American ambassador.
The narrator, Joe Lucas, is sent by J. Edgar Hoover to infiltrate Hemingway's op.
There seems to be a lot of espionage going on in Cuba
and it looks like Hemingway is being set up for something.

Based loosely on true events, this is entertaining,
if a tad longwinded and confusing.
