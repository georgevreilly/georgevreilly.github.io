`Mary Russell <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Russell_(fictional)>`_\ —\
Sherlock Holmes' much younger wife—\
investigates the odd goings on in a British silent film company
that's making a pirate film on location in Lisbon and Morocco in 1924.
The filmmakers get more than they bargained for,
as the rogues they cast as pirates seem to be *real* pirates.

A decent entry in this series.
