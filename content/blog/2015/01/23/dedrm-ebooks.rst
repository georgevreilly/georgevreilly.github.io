When I buy a book, I want to be able to read it how and where I like,
not where the bookseller dictates.
With printed books, the very idea of the bookseller having any say is ridiculous.
The book is now my property, to read where and how I like,
to give away or to lend or even to sell.
I've bought thousands of new books and thousands more secondhand books from bookstores.

Most electronic books are crippled with DRM.
DRM stands for `Digital Rights Management`_,
although `Defective By Design`_ prefers to expand DRM
as `Digital Restrictions Management`_.
DRM is technology that controls digital content *after* it has been sold.
In particular, DRM'd ebooks sold at Amazon are encrypted
and can only be read on Kindle devices and apps.
Similarly, DRM'd ebooks from Barnes & Noble are restricted to Nook devices and apps.

Some publishers sell DRM-free ebooks at Amazon and B&N,
but they're in a small minority.
When I buy technical books, I try to buy directly from the publishers,
who will often bundle both the ebook and the pbook editions together
for a fraction of their separate costs.

Having paid for an ebook, I want to read it on whatever computer or device is at hand,
regardless of where I bought it.
I can do that if I remove the DRM encryption.
Tools exist to help with that,
such as Apprentice Alf's `DRM Removal Tools for eBooks`_.
The plugin for Calibre_ works very well.
I convert ebooks to unlocked EPUBs,
which I can then read on my eInk reader,
or with the Readium_ browser extension in Chrome,
or the `EPUBReader`_ browser extension for Firefox,
or the Clearview_ app on my Macâ€”\
or in the original seller's app.
It's my choice.
