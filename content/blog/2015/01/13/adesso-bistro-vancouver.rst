We discovered `Adesso Bistro`_ just around the corner
from where we're staying in the West End of Vancouver.
It was very quiet tonight, with only one other table occupied while we were there
and another table leaving as we arrived.

I enjoyed the Prix Fixe menu of Gnocchi, Brasato (braised beef), and Panna Cotta.
Emma wasn't feeling too well,
so she had a light salad and half a mushroom pizza.
Both the food and the service were very good.
We'd certainly go again.
