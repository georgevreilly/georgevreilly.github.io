We went to hear `Matt Taibbi <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Taibbi>`_
speak at `Town Hall Seattle <http://townhallseattle.org/>`_ tonight.
He spoke about the topic of his new book,
`The Divide <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Divide:_American_Injustice_in_the_Age_of_the_Wealth_Gap>`_,
which covers inequality in the United States.
After several years of covering white-collar crime in Wall Street
after the financial collapse of 2008,
and not seeing *any* prosecutions,
he got curious about what the criminal justice system is like for the poor.
`Community policing 
<http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-nypds-work-stoppage-is-surreal-20141231>`_
is harsh in many poor communities,
like Ferguson and Staten Island,
where the police regularly issue tickets for minor infractions.
Those being summonsed can ill-afford the fines,
often leading to worse consequences.
The U.S. prison population is now twice as high as it was in 1991
and four times as high as 1980.

I bought the book.
