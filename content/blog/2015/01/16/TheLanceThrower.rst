Jack Whyte's `Camulod Chronicles`_ is a series of novels
about King Arthur and Camelot in a post-Roman Britain.
This book tells how Lancelot (Clothar the Frank) came to Camulod and met Arthur—\
and it takes the entire book to get to that point.
Only after several hundred pages of Clothar's childhood and early manhood
and fighting a civil war in his uncle's small kingdom in Gaul,
do we proceed to Britain.

As with Uther_ and other books in the series,
I found Whyte to be extraordinarily long-winded.
He can tell a story and hold one's attention,
but he spends too long doing it.
Recommended primarily for completists.
