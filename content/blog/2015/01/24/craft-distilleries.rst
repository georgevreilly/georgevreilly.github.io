Washington state is well-known for coffee, wineries, and microbreweries.
Dozens of small-batch craft distilleries
have been started in Washington state since 2008
after a change in the law.
Most of them are quite good.
I drink Irish and Scotch whiskies,
but otherwise neither of us drink spirits often,
so we've barely tried the local distilleries.

We drank a really nice gin from Sun Liquor at a New Year's Eve party,
and we've been meaning to follow up.
This afternoon, we stopped at the Oola Distillery on Capitol Hill
and sampled all their wares.
We left with a half bottle of their
`Rosemary Vodka <http://ooladistillery.com/home#products>`_.
Then we stopped in at Sun Liquor and came out with a bottle of the
`Hedge Trimmer Gin <http://sunliquor.com/hedgetrimmergin.php>`_.

At the rate we consume spirits, those should last quite a while.
