Danny Boyle is growing up in Dublin in the 1960s and 1970s,
watched over by his grandmother.
First as she raises him, then from beyond the grave.
Danny, as his parents did before him, is making a mess of his life,
and he's a small-time drug dealer with some big problems.

I grew up in Dublin, about a decade behind Danny Boyle,
so I enjoyed Murphy's evocation of Dublin in the 1970s.
However, I disliked his constant changing of viewpoint
and frequent hopping back and forth across the timeline.
Although he attempts some heavy topics\
—drugs, IRA violence, changing social *mores*\ —\
I found the book rather lightweight.
