Detective Inspector Tony McLean of the Edinburgh Police has multiple deaths to deal with:
an elderly rich man, murdered horribly;
the newly discovered corpse of a girl killed in some ghoulish ritual sixty years ago;
and the death of the grandmother who raised him.
Then more elderly men start being murdered.

I enjoyed this police procedural and I liked the character of Tony McLean.
The two cases start dovetailing together (one of my pet peeves)
and I was surprised when the author introduced supernatural elements,
since I had thought it was a straight crime novel.
