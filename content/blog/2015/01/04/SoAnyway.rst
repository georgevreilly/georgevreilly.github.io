The first volume of `John Cleese <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleese>`_'s autobiography
takes us through the first 30 years of his life,
from his birth in Weston-super-Mare in 1939
to the creation of Monty Python's Flying Circus in 1969.
I learned along the way
that his mother was impossible;
that the Pythons consider themselves writers first, performers second;
that he greatly enjoyed his school years;
quite a lot about the various TV and radio shows he worked on before Python;
not much about his first marriage to Connie Booth;
and that his speech in
`A Fish Called Wanda <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fish_Called_Wanda>`_ about 
`the English been stifled and terrified of embarrassment
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095159/quotes?item=qt0320193>`_
was truly heartfelt.

I look forward to the next volume.
