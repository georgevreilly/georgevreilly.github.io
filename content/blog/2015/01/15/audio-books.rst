I've always been an avid—nay, avaricious—reader of books.
But I have not been a listener of audiobooks.

I read quickly, much more quickly than anyone can speak,
and I enjoy burying my head in a book.
I've seen little reason, therefore, to listen to audiobooks.
Lately, however, we've listened to some audiobooks on long car trips,
as Emma, unlike me, has an `Audible <http://www.audible.com/>`_ subscription.
We enjoyed `The Hot Rock`_, the first of the comic crime-caper `Dortmunder`_ books.
Before that, I had read another Dortmunder novel, *Bank Shot*, aloud to Emma,
while she drove us back from Portland,
which both of us had enjoyed.

On our trip to Vancouver earlier this week,
we started listening to `The Beekeeper's Apprentice`_,
the first of the `Mary Russell`_ novels about the protégé and wife of Sherlock Holmes.
The recording is 12 hours long, so we're continuing to listen to it
even though we're back in Seattle.

I won't be giving up reading any time soon,
but I do foresee listening to the occasional audiobook.
