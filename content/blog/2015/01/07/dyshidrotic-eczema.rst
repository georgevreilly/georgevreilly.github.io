    Dyshidrosis_ (/dɪs.haɪˈdroʊ.sɨs/,
    also known as "acute vesiculobullous hand eczema,"
    "cheiropompholyx," "dyshidrotic eczema," "pompholyx," and "podopompholyx")
    is a skin condition that is characterized by small blisters on the hands or feet.

I've occasionally had little blisters
appear on my fingers and palms in hot weather in the past.
These vesicles are filled with clear liquid, annoying and a little bit sore,
and they sting when my hands are soaked in water.

In August, they came back and they were larger and more swollen than ever before.
My doctor diagnosed a case of dyshidrotic eczema
and prescribed `clobetasol propionate`_ ointment.
The eczema promptly cleared up, but I had peeling skin on my fingertips
for weeks after I stopped using the ointment.
Clobetasol apparently thins the skin and prolonged use is not recommended.
For weeks I rubbed Vaseline into my hands to help the peeling.

I had a milder recurrence just after Christmas.
Again, the ointment cleared up the eczema quickly
and again the peeling skin persists long after.
It's annoying but I can live with it.
