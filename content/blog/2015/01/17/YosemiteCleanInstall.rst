Every few years, I find it necessary to wipe my computers
and do a clean install of the operating system.
As a developer and a power user, I install a lot of software.
The cumulative effect of installations and upgrades
is to leave a lot of cruft on the machines.
Entropy increases and the machines grow slower and perhaps less reliable.
So I like to wipe the hard disk, install a new operating system,
and reinstall only those apps that I know I need.

My mid-2012 MacBook Pro came with OS X 10.7.
Shortly thereafer, 10.8 was released and I promptly upgraded; likewise with 10.9.
Yosemite_ (10.10) was released in October 2014,
but I held off switching until now,
as I knew I wanted to do a clean install,
which meant setting aside a sizeable block of time.

I backed up everything during the week,
over and above my normal backups of external drives,
`CrashPlan`_, `Dropbox`_, and `GitHub`_.
I made a list of all the apps that I care about and of various settings.
And I prepared a `bootable thumb drive`_ with the OS X Yosemite Installer app.

Last night, I inserted the thumb drive into the USB slot.
I restarted the machine while holding down the Option key,
which brought me to a boot menu.
I used Disk Utility to erase the partition and then I installed Yosemite.

And then I spent many hours installing apps I care about
and restoring data.

I've been a fan of the Homebrew_ package manager for several years.
It does a great job of installing and updating developer-related tools
for use at the command line.
Last year, I learned about a sister project, `Homebrew Cask`_,
which takes of installing graphical applications.
Instead of downloading DMGs, I used Cask to install a number of apps.

I discovered `Caskroom Fonts`_ last night,
which took care of installing most of the fonts I care about.
One exception: I wanted to install Consolas and some of the other C* fonts
from the `ClearType Font Collection`_, without installing Microsoft Office.
It's possible to do that via Microsoft's `Open XML File Format Converter for Mac`_.

My 2Â½-year-old machine feels faster and more responsive after the clean install.
I upgraded my late-2013 work MacBook Pro to Yosemite a couple of months ago,
without seeing a difference in performance,
so I attribute the improvement to getting rid of a lot of crap.
