Marsh Tanner is a San Francisco private investigator.
His secretary Peggy is starting to unravel,
as she's been getting sexually harassing phone calls for months,
which she's hidden from Marsh.
Thing is, she's also started to develop a case of
`Stockholm syndrome <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome>`_
with her stalker.
Marsh discovers more about Peggy—and himself—than he really wants to.

Moderately enjoyable.
I found the plot and the characters plausible,
unlike so many modern stories.
