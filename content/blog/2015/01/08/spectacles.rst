Reading `Why the Eyewear Industry Is An Incredible Rip-Off`_
reminds me that I need to get some new glasses.
I had my eyes tested last month and there is a small change in the prescription.
I've had my current glasses for about six years.

From ages 12 to 44, I needed only distance lenses for my myopia,
but then in the space of just a few months,
I developed the classic problem of middle age:
it became hard for me to read.
I got a pair of glasses with progressive_ lenses.
I was used to having fairly clear peripheral vision
and I had to learn to turn my head rather than my eyes.

Despite some of the warnings in the comments on the article about the eyewear industry,
I think I'll try ordering some glasses online and see how they work out for me.
I'll get a pair of `computer glasses`_, since I stare at screens all day long.
