For the CookBrite holiday party this evening,
we selected recipes from the CookBrite app
and cooked them for each other.

We had a lot of good food.
I particularly enjoyed making and drinking these milkshakes.

Ingredients
-----------

* 1 pint Chocolate Gelato
* 2 oz Bittersweet Chocolate
* 1Â½ cup Buttermilk

Instructions
------------

* Remove the gelato from the freezer to soften.
* Melt the chocolate in the microwave or in a small saucepan over low heat.
* Let the chocolate cool.
* In a blender, combine the gelato and buttermilk until thick and creamy.
* With the motor running, slowly pour the melted chocolate into the gelato-buttermilk mixture.
* Divide the milkshakes among individual glasses and serve immediately.

Cooking time: 12 minutes
