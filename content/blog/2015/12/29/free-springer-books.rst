Via `Hacker News <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10810271>`_,
"All Springer Textbooks More Than 10 Years Old Available for Free Legal Download".

This includes books from Apress
as well as a ton of those impenetrable gray-and-red
Lecture Notes in Computer Science books.

**Update 2015-12-30**: No longer available.
Springer aren't commenting. Presumably a mistake.
