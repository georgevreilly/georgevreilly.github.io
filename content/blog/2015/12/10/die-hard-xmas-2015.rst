We have three non-traditional Christmas movies
that we watch almost every December,
`Die Hard <http://diehard.wikia.com/wiki/Die_Hard>`_,
`Die Hard 2: Die Harder <http://diehard.wikia.com/wiki/Die_Hard_2>`_,
and `The Ref <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ref>`_.

Die Hards 1 and 2 are the best in the series.
Although they seemed wildly over the top when they were made (1988 and 1990),
they seem understated compared to the thrillers that Hollywood pumps out now.

We saw Die Hard again tonight.
Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman shine in their breakout roles.
Willis exhibits the trademark cockiness that was already familiar 
from `Moonlighting <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlighting_(TV_series)>`_,
but he's not as obnoxious as he often was in later roles.
Rickman gently nibbles the scenery as a terrorist turned master criminal.
