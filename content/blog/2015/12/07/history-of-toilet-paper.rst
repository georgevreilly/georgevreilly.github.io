At Freely Speaking Toastmasters tonight,
Kim gave a talk_ on the History of Toilet Paper.
It was inspired by the quote above from the `Iron Druid Chronicles`_,
by a 2000-year-old druid.

She got much of her information from `wikipedia`_.
I found the `toilet paper FAQ`_ while writing this post.

At FSTM, after the speech evaluator gives the speaker a formal evaluation,
we have five minutes of open evaluation from the audience.

My father has a hundred or so sayings that he trots out again and again and again—\
much to the annoyance of those who know him well.
When he moved from the Dublin to the London office of his bank in the late eighties,
his staff presented him with an album of the Collected Sayings of C. Vincent Reilly.

One of his favorite sayings had come to mind during Kim's speech.
It became my contribution to the open evaluation.

| In days of old
|  when knights were bold
|  before toilet paper was invented,
| they wiped their asses
|  with sods of grasses
|  and walked away quite contented.
