Two weeks ago, we painted the kitchen blue.
A deeper blue than I had intended.
It had more than a little bit of the Greek taverna about it.

Today, we started work on the "bar room",
the room between the kitchen and the back yard,
where we keep the booze.
No painting yet.
We've taken everything out of that room and cleaned.
Fifteen years of cobwebs have been removed from behind the book cases.

Soon, a lighter blue.
