Aside from a few hours spent at two parties,
we've worked from when we got up until midnight
getting the bar room back in shape.
I spent a couple of hours just washing all the greasy crystal glasses this morning
(not to be confused with last night's `cleaning the booze bottles`_).
We sorted through all the cookbooks and set aside about a third of them.
The room is now ready to use again.
Alas, we've moved a pile of stuff temporarily into the spare room,
which will have to be dealt with soon.
