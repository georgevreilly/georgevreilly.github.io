Loosely modeled on the rise of the Han dynasty,
Ken Liu's fantasy tells us of two men who rise up to challenge the emperor.
Kuni Garu, the wily and wise one-time bandit, and
Mata Zyndu, the warrior scion of a deposed noble clan,
are friends initially but fall out.
The gods are at play in the affairs of men
and they take pleasure in causing trouble and strife.

I enjoyed the novel, but I disliked the pace at which Liu galloped through events.
