[Sequel to `The Magician King`_]

At the beginning of `The Magician's Land`_,
Quentin Coldwater is in exile from Fillory.
After a brief sojourn of teaching at Brakebills,
where he researches an enormously complex spell he found in the Neitherlands,
he is fired and Plum, a student, is expelled.
A mysterious summons draws them into a magical heist, which goes awry.
Meanwhile, Fillory is dying
and Eliot, Janet, Josh, and Poppy are trying to save it.

Quentin has matured over the trilogy,
emotionally and as a magician,
rising to the daunting challenges
"He was circling back to all the things he'd fought and lost over the years,
and one by one he was putting them to rest."

*The Magician's Land* is darkly funny and entertaining and exciting,
and a fitting conclusion to the series.
(The apocalypse of Fillory is delightfully twisted.)
Recommended.
