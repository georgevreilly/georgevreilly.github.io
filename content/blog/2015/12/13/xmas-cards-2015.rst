It seems old-fashioned to do so,
but I still like to send and to receive Christmas cards.
We wrote `30 cards`_ last weekend.
Almost all were `Wondermark Multi-Purpose Greeting Cards`_,
from a Kickstarter that Emma contributed to a few months ago.

Speaking of Kickstarters,
`No Holds Bard`_ showed up in my Facebook feed today.
I was so tickled by the concept that I anted up $10.
I've read several novels where Will Shakespeare was a character,
such as `Ink and Steel`_ and `Revenger`_,
but never a comic book where he was a superhero.

Yesterday, we started receiving cards from other people.
A couple of dozen more will follow.
