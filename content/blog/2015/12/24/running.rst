I shared a house with my friend Muhsin in the mid-90s.
Muhsin is a runner so I started running too,
but I lost the habit not long after I moved in with Emma in '98.

A little over a year ago, I went down to the Bay Area for work.
I spent the weekend staying with old friends from Ireland, Paul and Maggie.
Paul had been run down by a car while cycling at twilight at Christmas 2013.
As part of his recovery, he had taken up running,
and a few weeks before my trip, he challenged me to join him in a 5K run for charity.

And so I resumed my running habit, albeit intermittently.
I'm not a fast runner, averaging about 10 minutes per mile,
but that's not all that slow for a 50-year-old recreational runner.

I ran quite regularly while we were in Berlin in June and July this year.
I've been less consistent since then.
Lately I've been blaming the rain and the short daysâ€”\
we've had an extraordinarily wet November and December in Seattle.

Today I wasn't working, there was no rain this morning, and I had no excuses.
So I pulled on my running shoes and went for a 3-mile run.
I didn't quite run the whole way, as I stopped and walked twice.

I aim to run a couple of more times over this long weekend.
Call it an early start on a New Year's Resolution.
