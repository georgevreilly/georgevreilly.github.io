A woman calls at a Yorkshire police station to talk to her friend,
Detective Inspector Alan Banks, about the gun she found in her daughter's bedroom.
Banks is out of the country, however.
An unregistered gun is a serious offence under British law
and the police take it very seriously.
The daughter's friend—Banks' own daughter, Tracy—goes to warn the owner,
and he goes on the run with Tracy.
She's willing at first then realizes that she's in way over her head with this bad boy.

Another good entry in Robinson's long-running series about
`Inspector Banks <http://www.inspectorbanks.com/books/bad-boy-2010/>`_.
