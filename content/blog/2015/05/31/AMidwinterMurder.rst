Tom Musgrave, sword master and master of logic,
is called away from the Elizabethan court to the Scottish borders,
where his brother has been found dead—\
apparently frozen in terror by the sight of a hellhound.
Musgrave uncovers a nest of intrigue and murder when he returns home to investigate.

Tonkin has written a good historical mystery,
though I found the protaganist's ratiocinative powers improbable.
