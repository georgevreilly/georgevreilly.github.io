Fifteenth book in the `Dresden Files <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files>`_
series of urban fantasies.

Harry Dresden is Chicago's only professional wizard
and the Winter Knight to Queen Mab.
Mab compels him to team up with one of his old enemies to rob an impregnable vault,
a vault that belongs to Hades, lord of the Underworld.
Harry distrusts Nicodemus—rightfully, as Nicodemus turns on him.
But Harry can stab backs too.

A solid entry in this long running series.
Harry is increasingly careworn but he still cracks wise,
entertaining the readers if not his antagonists.
