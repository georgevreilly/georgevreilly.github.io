A murder in Sussex bears similarities to another recent murder in Scotland,
but what could the link between the two men be?
One of the victims left a half-written letter addressed to `John Madden`_,
who is now retired from Scotland Yard.
Soon there are more victims and Madden and the police struggle to find the killer.

Airth evokes both the First and Second World Wars,
exploring the damage done to those who survived
and the injustices visited upon some who did not.
