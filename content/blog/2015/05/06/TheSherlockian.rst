Two mysteries are intertwined in this novel.
In the present day, a long-lost diary of Arthur Conan Doyle's from 1900
has apparently been rediscovered,
but the finder has been murdered,
while in 1900, Doyle and Bram Stoker investigate the murder of several young women.

The two mysteries are artfully intertwined and the plots move along nicely.
I was irritated by the author's ignorance of Victorian England—\
"It was a Victorian-era shilling, worth only five pennies in its day"
(twelve, dammit, until decimalisation in 1971)—\
and weak grasp of ACD's style.
