`Operation Gold`_ was one of the CIA's great exploits of the Cold War:
a tunnel running from West Berlin into the Russian sector
to tap into the Soviet communication lines.
It was believed to be a great success when the Russians broke into the tunnel in 1956.
Later it was discovered that `George Blake`_, the MI6 traitor,
had betrayed the tunnel from the beginning.

Leonard Marnham is a British Post Office engineer
who is sent to Berlin to help the Americans.
A naive 25-year-old virgin who lives at home with his parents,
he starts to blossom when he meets Maria, a pretty German girl.
Things are mostly going well—\
sex; some jealousy; engagement; the British want him to lift American technology—\
when a tragic accident occurs.
The blackly comic consequences put an end to whatever innocence remained to him.

McEwen is an astute observer of character and a fine storyteller.
