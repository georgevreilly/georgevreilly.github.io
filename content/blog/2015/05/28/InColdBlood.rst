`In Cold Blood <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Cold_Blood>`_,
Truman Capote's bestselling non-fiction novel,
describes the 1959 murder of a wealthy farmer and his family,
which terrorized Kansas;
the investigation by the Kansas Bureau of Investigation;
the arrest six weeks later of two parolees,
Dick Hickock and Perry Smith;
and the lives and deaths of Hickock and Smith.
Smith was a ne'er-do-well, brought up by footloose alcoholic parents,
with two siblings dead of suicide,
while Hickock had been brought up in a good home.

Capote “recreated” the events of the Clutter murder
and, incidentally, helped create the genre of *true crime*.
I put *recreated* in quotes
because there's considerable doubt about the veracity of some events he describes.
Nevertheless, it's a cogent and lucid account.
The Philip Seymour Hoffman movie of `Capote <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capote_(film)>`_,
which prompted me to read *In Cold Blood*,
focuses on Capote and his writing of the book and wooing of Smith.
In the book itself,
Capote is a distant authorial voice.

Fifty years later, the book seems a little quaint and dated, but it holds up well.
