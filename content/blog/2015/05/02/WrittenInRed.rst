In a world where the "Others"—werewolves, vampires, elementals, and more—have the upper hand
and live in proximity to humans,
they have need for some human staff to interact with their neighbors.
Meg Corbyn takes the job, but she has a secret.
She is a Blood Prophet on the run from those who have controlled her all her life.

Bishop provides an interestingly different spin on werewolves and vampires
that I found entertaining.
