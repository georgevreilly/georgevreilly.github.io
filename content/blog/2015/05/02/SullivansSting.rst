The charmingly amoral David Rathbone leads a small group of Palm Beach conmen.
A task force of police and federal agents are trying to take them down,
and Rita Sullivan goes undercover and flirts her way into David's bed.
Sullivan and some of the other undercover cops start losing their perspective
and get a little too close to their targets.
