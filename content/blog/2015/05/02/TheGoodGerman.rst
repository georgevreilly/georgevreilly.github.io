Jake Geismar is an American war correspondent who lived in Berlin before the war.
He returns there in July 1945, ostensibly to cover the
`Potsdam Conference <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam_Conference>`_,
but actually to find his lover, Lena.
Before he finds Lena,
he finds the body of a murdered American officer at Potsdam,
which—strangely—no-one is interested in.
Then he gets caught up in the race between the Americans and the Russians
to take possession of Lena's estranged husband, a rocket scientist.

The war is barely over
but already the Russians and Americans are squaring off for the Cold War,
as they squabble over the spoils of a shattered Germany.
Moral ambiguities abound.
