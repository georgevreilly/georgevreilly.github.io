Someone keeps throwing the events of Dr Thomas Wayne's life into his son Bruce's face.
The murder of his parents when he was a boy ultimately led to his becoming the Batman.
Now he realizes that he knew less than he had thought about his father.

Hickham does a good job of filling out the story of the Wayne family
and the mark they left on Gotham.
