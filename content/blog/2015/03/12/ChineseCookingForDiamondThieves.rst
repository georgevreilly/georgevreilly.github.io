Tucker may be a white guy but he's been cooking Chinese food since he was a child,
and he's good at it—good enough to get a job at a Chinese restaurant as a cook.
Then there's Corinne, trying to avoid the Chinese gangsters
who are convinced she has their diamonds.

Lowry shows a light touch in this quirky and entertaining boy-meets-girl story.
