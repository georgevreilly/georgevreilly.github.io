India has split apart by 2047,
into a dozen competing states desperate for the life-giving monsoon rains.
New castes have appeared, as have the new gender of nutes.
Aeais (artificial intelligences) abound
but are strictly proscribed from attaining full sentience.
And an asteroid with seven-billion-year-old images of now-living people has been discovered.

McDonald draws together nine people from different walks of life,
weaving their tales into one tapestry.
India, ancient yet up-to-the-minute, is the vibrant backdrop for this explosion of ideas.
