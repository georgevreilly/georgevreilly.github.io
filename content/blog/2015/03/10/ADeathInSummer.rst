An Irish newspaper magnate has been found with his head blown off by a shotgun.
Quirke, the pathologist, looks into it and realizes that it's not suicide but murder.
As he digs deeper, he finds secrets that the wealthy elite of 1950s Dublin
do not want revealed, and he finds himself drawn to the dead man's French widow.

Benjamin Black (aka John Banville)
deftly recreates 1950s Ireland through the eyes of Quirke,
who, though well placed, is more of an observer than an insider,
and of his grown daughter, Phoebe.
