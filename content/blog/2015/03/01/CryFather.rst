Patterson Wells lives dangerously, clearing fallen trees in hurricane season.
Since the death of his young son a few years ago, he's been lost in a self-destructive fog.
His life becomes entangled with that of his neighbor's grown son, Junior,
another lost soul.
Wells and Junior bond after a fashion,
as their lives spiral further out of control,
with drug deals gone bad, drunken sprees, and murders.

Fascinating in a grim can't-look-away-from-the-trainwreck fashion.
Whitmer writes lyrically about broken lives and disposable people.
