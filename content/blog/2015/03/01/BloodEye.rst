When the Norse raiders arrive in the English village,
Raven, the young outsider who was found two years before with no memory,
realizes that he speaks their language.
He is drawn to them and he joins them in their quest for glory, plunder, and battle.

After a slow start, the plot moves along with enough fighting to hold one's interest.
Aside from Raven, the characters are poorly drawn,
with little to distinguish or motivate them.
