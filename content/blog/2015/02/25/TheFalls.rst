A young woman from a prominent family is missing
and the Edinburgh police are looking for her.
In time, they find her body.
A small wooden coffin is found near her home,
and DI John Rebus links that to some cold cases,
while DC Siobhan Clarke tracks down the mysterious Quizmaster on the Internet.

Another enjoyable and competent police procedural from Ian Rankin.
