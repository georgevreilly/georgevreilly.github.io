Five years ago, the Greatcoats were the lawgivers of Tristia.
And then the good king was deposed by the dukes and the Greatcoats were broken up.
Now despised, only a few are left, taking work as caravan guards and sellswords.
Falcio, the former First Cantor, finally starts to care again,
as he is sucked into the dukes' intrigues.

*Traitor's Blade* starts out light-hearted and joky,
growing darker and more passionate
as Falcio opens himself up and rediscovers his honor.
De Castell is a fine storyteller and the action moves quickly.
