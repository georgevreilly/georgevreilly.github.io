In 2016, I threw an Election Night victory party for Hillary Clinton.
It turned into a wake.

In 2016, it was obvious to me and to millions of others
that Trump was unfit to be President.
There were weak excuses that he might turn out to be more presidential
after the campaign was over.
Instead, we got the worst president we've ever seen in the US.
Morally unfit.
Temperamentally unfit.
Ethically unfit.
A pathological liar.
A shatterer of alliances.
A demagogue, stoking the flames of right-wing violent extremism.

In 2018, there are no excuses for not seeing how dangerous Trump is.
Trump himself is not on the ballot,
but this is nonetheless a referendum on Trump.
The Republican party have done nothing to rein in his excesses.
They will continue to do nothing if they retain the House of Representatives.

The Republicans must be voted out of power in the House.
The Senate too, if that's possible.
Trump is deeply unpopular outside his base,
but structural inequalities, gerrymandering, and voter suppression
all make it far from certain that the Democrats can win tonight.

Brace yourselves for a backlash.

If the Democrats win a narrow victory,
expect rage and violence from the right-wing
that dwarfs that of the last few weeks.
Trump has been laying down a narrative of a stolen election again,
just as he did before the 2016 election.

If the Republicans retain control,
what little restraint that was still in place will go.
They will not be magnanimous in victory.

We may not know the final results for weeks,
as tight races are counted and recounted.

The best outcome is for
the Democrats to win a resounding victory and sweep the House.
I don't know if we can pull that off.
But the best way to be sure is for everyone
to *vote Democrat* today.

Please vote.
It matters.
