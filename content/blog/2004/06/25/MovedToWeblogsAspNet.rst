After several months of not blogging, I've decided to resume. EraBlog was
nice while it lasted, but Mike Amundsen hasn't been paying attention to it
for a while. I was always frustrated at the lack of configurability, and I
hated the hard-coded limit of three posts showing up on the front page.

I've moved to http://weblogs.asp.net/george_v_reilly/.

**Update**: See `next post
</blog/2005/12/05/MovedToGeorgeVReillycomblog.html>`_.
I've long since moved to
`GeorgeVReilly.com/blog </blog/>`_.
