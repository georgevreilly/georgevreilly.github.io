George W. Bush, after months of hinting that he would support the Federal
Marriage Amendment, has endorsed it. He's desparately trying to change the
subject from whether he was AWOL from the National Guard in Alabama.

The Human Rights Campaign is urging everyone to oppose this. They provide a
sample letter to send to your representatives, but I threw it away and
wrote my own (below), which has been sent to my representatives, via the
`HRC Action Center <http://www.hrcactioncenter.org/campaign/bush_fma>`_.

    The Bush Administration pisses me off on so many levels. I'm
    particularly infuriated about Bush's support for the Federal Marriage
    Amendment. After hinting that he'd support it for the last few months,
    he's now trying to change the subject from the charges that he was AWOL
    from the Air National Guard.

    The FMA is a rabble-rousing exercise cooked up by the likes to Donald
    Wildmon to invigorate the religious right. Once again, the know-nothing
    bible thumpers are demonizing gay people. I'm sick of it.

    Specious arguments about the sanctity of marriage fall flat when you
    consider that 50% of marriages end in divorce and Britney Spear's
    frivolous prank has more legal standing than a gay couple that have
    been together for decades.

    The federal government has no business interfering in marriage. That's
    the states' prerogative.

    Several commentators have argued that not only would the FMA forbid gay
    marriage, it would also void any civil unions legislation that some
    states may pass.

    We should be following the example of most Western European nations and
    decoupling the civil and religious aspects of marriage. The state and
    only the state can marry you. A religious wedding has no legal
    significance. I don't expect this to happen in the US anytime soon. So
    much for the Separation of Church and State.

    I fully expect you to vigorously oppose the FMA.

    I would very much like for you to support gay marriage, or at least
    civil unions.

My representatives are Rep. Jim McDermott, Sen. Patty Murray, and Sen.
Maria Cantwell, Jim McDermott is very liberal and needs no urging to oppose
it; Cantwell and Murray are fairly liberal, but it does no harm to stiffen
their spines. Or for me to vent.
