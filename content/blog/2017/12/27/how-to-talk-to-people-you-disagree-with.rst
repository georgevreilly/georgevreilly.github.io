I came across an interesting post on Medium earlier tonight,
`How to talk to people you disagree with`_.

It can be hard to have a fruitful conversation with people you're at odds with,
especially online.

Jeremy Caney has 10 suggestions:

1. Leave the insults at the door
2. Understand what’s driving their views
3. Speak to their values
4. Know what you’re talking about
5. Acknowledge when you’re wrong
6. Stay focused on the issue at hand
7. Be prepared to take heat from your team
8. Don’t expect capitulation
9. Know when to walk away
10. Be mindful of the onlookers
