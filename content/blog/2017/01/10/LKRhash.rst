LKRhash is a hashtable that scales to multiple processors and to millions of items.
LKRhash was invented at Microsoft in 1997
by Per-Ã…ke (Paul) Larson of Microsoft Research
and Murali Krishnan and George Reilly of Internet Information Services.
LKRhash has been used in many Microsoft products.
The techniques that give LKRhash its performance
include `linear hashing`__, cache-friendly data structures, and fine-grained locking.

* `Unpublished paper`__ submitted to `Software: Practice & Experience`__ (Oct 1999).
* `US 6,578,131 patent`__. Associated PDF__ contains some of the SP&E paper.

If Microsoft had had `20% time`__,
LKRhash would have been my main 20% project.
I put a lot of effort into making it a polished, well-tuned library
that was used in multiple products across the company.
I even ported the C++ code to kernel mode,
though it never ended up in a production driver, as far as I know.
Several years ago, after I left Microsoft,
I attempted to get it open-sourced.
However, despite some help on the inside,
we were never able to surmount the legal barriers.
