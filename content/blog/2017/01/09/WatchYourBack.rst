*Watch Your Back!* is one of the last `Dortmunder novels`__,
Westlake's comic series about an `unlucky crook`__
published between 1970 and 2008.
Dortmunder and his crew have a sweet lead on an unoccupied penthouse apartment,
but their usual planning space, the O.J. Bar & Grill,
has been turned into a `bust-out joint`__ by the Jersey mob.
So now they have two jobs to pull:
rob the obnoxious rich guy's art and save the O.J.
Of course, complications arise
because nothing ever goes to plan in a Dortmunder book.

Enjoyable.
