Dave Cunane is Manchester's mouthiest PI.
He gets tangled up with the wild daughter-in-law of the crooked Carlyle family.
Marti wants him to prove the innocence of her father who's doing life for killing a cop.
She doesn't go over well with Dave's own half-crazy girlfriend.
Neither the Carlyles nor Dave's ex-police father want Vince King freed.
It's not going to end well.
