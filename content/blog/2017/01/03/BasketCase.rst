`Basket Case`_, like most of Hiaasen's novels,
is a humorous crime caper set in Florida.
Quick-witted but neurotic reporter Jack Tagger
has been exiled to the obituary department for mouthing off too often.
When Jimmy Stoma, lead singer of the Slut Puppies, dies in an apparent accident,
Tagger senses a potential story and a chance for a comeback.
But he has to get the story before it gets taken away from him.

Hiaasen, himself a journalist, also uses the novel to explore journalism as a career
and to rant about the gutting of newspapers by corporations
who prioritize profits over quality.
But he has a light touch and it doesn't detract from the story.

Enjoyable.
