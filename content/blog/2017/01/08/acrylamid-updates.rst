`Last weekend`__, I restored a number of posts that had appeared
on the earlier `dasBlog`_ incarnation of this blog,
but had never made it to the `Acrylamid`_ version.

I added about another 50 posts this weekend,
taken from the `Wayback Machine`__.
I think that this is all the posts that are missing.

That required further fixup.
I had to turn the HTML back into reStructuredText, which I did by hand.

Some useful tips will follow in future posts.
