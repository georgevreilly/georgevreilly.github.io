I've worn a beard since 1986, when I was 21.
Only rarely have I been cleanshaven since then.
Emma, who met me in 1997,
has only seen me cleanshaven once before,
about 15 years ago.
I promptly regrew the beard that time.

I decided in October to fundraise for Movember__.
In truth, I was also curious to see
what I looked like without my trademark beard.
On Halloween night, I shaved everything off.
Interim photos as I whittled down the beard
can be seen below,
as can some progress photos taken since then
as I grew an over-the-top handlebar mustache.

I've let the rest of the beard start growing in
after my heel operation a week and a half ago.
I look quite ruffianly at the moment.
