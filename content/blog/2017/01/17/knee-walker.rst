I had heel surgery last week
to remove a heel spur which was causing tendonitis
and to repair the Achilles tendon.
More on that some other time.

I rented a knee walker this morning from `Eastside Leg Up`__.
I love it!
After barely getting around with crutches for a week,
the scooter makes a *huge* difference.
I can move around at normal walking pace now,
instead of wearing myself out with the crutches.

Incidentally, I found my first `WebP`__ image in the wild:
the original of the image that's shown here.
I used ImageMagick ``convert`` to make it into a JPEG.
