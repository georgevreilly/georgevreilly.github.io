A major American fundamentalist preacher has drawn
disturbingly close to the British Prime Minister,
and the more the Laundry looks, they more alarmed they become.
Hacker/computational demonologist/Laundry agent Bob Howard is leveling up with the Laundry
and he has been assigned to “External Assets”,
the wing that deals with deniable freelance agents.
Bob, Persephone Hazard, and Johnny McTavish
are sent to Colorado to investigate Golden Promise Ministries.
There they find a hidden cult within the church
where the members are possessed by alien parasites
that are trying to hasten the Apocalypse
by summoning a chained monster from another dimension.
