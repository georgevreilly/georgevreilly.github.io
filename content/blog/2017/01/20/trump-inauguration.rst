Twenty-eight years ago today,
I `attended George H.W Bush's inauguration`_.
By accident. Read `that post`_ for the rest of the story.

I didn't especially care for Bush Senior.
I certainly didn't care for George W. Bush,
who was the worst U.S. president in my memory.

We've just had one of the best.
Obama was a president of high personal character and competence.
His administration had integrity and remained free of scandals__.
He inherited an enormous economic mess and cleaned it up.
He introduced the Affordable Care Act,
something no other Democratic president managed.
He faced wholly unprecedented opposition and intransigence from the Republicans,
who vowed early on to make him a one-term president.

In mid-2011, two young developer friends of mine took positions
at `Obama for America`__, building the technology that helped re-elect Obama in 2012.
I had previously helped out with technology on the `Approve Referendum 71`__ campaign in 2009,
and I was somewhat interested in joining them.
After a phone interview with Harper Reed, the CTO of OFA,
he offered me a job sight unseen.
I thought about it, but declined.
It would have been a huge upset in our lives, a big paycut,
and I wasn't as keen on President Obama in 2011 as I had been about Candidate Obama in 2008.
In hindsight, perhaps I should have taken the job.
It would have been a hell of an experience.

After eight years of a decent president,
I am not looking forward to the Trump presidency.
I see him as dangerous, belligerent, thin-skinned, ill-prepared,
and profoundly unfit to be the most powerful man in the world.

A huge Women's March takes place tomorrow in Washington DC.
I have friends traveling from all over the country to take part.
A large Womxn's March will also take place in Seattle.
Were it not for my recent `heel operation`__, I would be marching with them in Seattle.
I may still attend and watch from the sidelines.

I've been helping out a little with the technology at Presterity__.
Jan Miksovsky co-founded Cozi where I spent six years.
Several weeks ago, he decided to bring some technology to bear on the Trump problem,
and he started Presterity,
a `community project to crowdsource information about the Trump administration`__.
I'll be doing more with Presterity in the coming months.
