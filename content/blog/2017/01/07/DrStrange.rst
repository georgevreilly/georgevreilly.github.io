Stephen Strange is a world-class surgeon whose talent is only matched by his arrogance.
His hands are ruined by a car crash, leaving him desperate to regain their use.
In Nepal, he finds a temple of sorcerers led by the Ancient One,
where he learns new and unsuspected ways of dealing with the world.
Eventually he takes on the renegade sorcerer Kaecilius,
who wants to summon Dormammu from the Dark Dimension to change the world.

Aside from his very odd American accent,
Benedict Cumberbatch does a decent job with a not-great script
of portraying one of Marvel's odder superheroes.
There was a lot of controversy over Tilda Swinton playing the Ancient One,
in yet another example of Hollywood whitewashing Asian characters.
We learned little about the other characters,
since everyone was running around like crazy for most of the film.
