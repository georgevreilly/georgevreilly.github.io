Tiffany Aching is now the overworked and overly responsible Witch of the Chalk.
People everywhere are fearing and distrusting witches more.
When her patient, the ailing Baron dies, she is blamed.
Other troubles multiply.
Eventually she realizes that the Cunning Man,
a long-dead witchfinder,
is seeping poison into people's hearts.
Aided by the troublemaking Nac Mac Feegle, she defeats him.
