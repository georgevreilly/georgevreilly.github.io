Four-year-old Amanda McCready has disappeared.
Her aunt, desperate to find her,
engages PIs Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro to find the child.
The mother, Helene, is drunken, slatternly, and neglectful:
in short, unfit and unsympathetic.
Kenzie and Gennaro don't want the case—\
the odds of finding Amanda alive and unharmed are low.
They'll go through hell before they succeed.

This book veers from blackly funny to gutwrenching.
Kenzie and Gennaro come up against the worst of the worst
and against decent people doing wrong for reasons that seem right to them.
Lehane pulls us through the wringer along with his characters.

Recommended.
