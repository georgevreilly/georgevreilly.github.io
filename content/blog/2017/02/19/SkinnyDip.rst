Joey Perrone is very surprised to find herself thrown off a cruise ship
on her second wedding anniversary.
After a night of swimming, she washes up on a small Florida island
in the company of a prematurely retired investigator.
Joey persuades Mick Stranahan not to report the attempted murder,
but instead to investigate and torment her worthless husband, Chaz,
who turns out to be a biostitute__ for a major polluter of the Everglades,
as well as a relentless pussyhound, an inept killer, and an all-round shitheel.

Hiaasen has a lot of fun at the expense of some of his characters,
but his outrage at the despoliation of the Everglades is quite real.
And once again, the grizzled cynical middleaged guy
attracts the pretty younger woman.
