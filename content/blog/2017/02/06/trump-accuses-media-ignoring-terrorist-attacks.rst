Donald Trump is now claiming__ (WaPo):

    Speaking to the U.S. Central Command on Monday,
    President Trump went off his prepared remarks to make a truly stunning claim:
    The media was intentionally covering up reports of terrorist attacks.

    “You’ve seen what happened in Paris, and Nice.
    All over Europe, it’s happening,” he said to the assembled military leaders.
    “It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported.
    And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it.
    They have their reasons, and you understand that.”

More: `The Atlantic`__, Vice__.

This is ridiculous on the face of it.
With literally billions of cellphone cameras in circulation
and hundreds of millions of people on social media,
how could a real terrorist attack be covered up?
And what would the media's motivation be for this coverup?
And how would they all stay on message?
Someone would scoop them.
This is the kind of horseshit that InfoWars__ flings around.

It's another damned lie from Trump.
Whether it's part of a deliberate plan or he's making shit up in the moment,
it hardly matters.
Trump and Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer
and the rest of his administration
are lying repeatedly and shamelessly.

After Trump won the election,
I entertained a faint hope
that the grave responsibility of becoming the leader of the free world
might cause Trump to become a little more serious and measured.
As the presidential transition wore on, that hope died an ugly death.
Two weeks after the Inauguration,
it's very clear that Trump will lie about anything
and pick a fight with anyone.

There is worse to come.
