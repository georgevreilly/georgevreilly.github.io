Two years ago, just after the death of Richard Adams,
I reread the book_ of *Watership Down*
for the first time in many years,
having originally discovered it when it was new
in the mid-1970s.
There's a beautiful new adaptation,
an animated miniseries_ made by the BBC and Netflix.

This adaptation is largely faithful to the original book:
The brave young rabbits striking out on their own
before their home warren is destroyed;
creating a new warren on Watership Down;
the war with the totalitarian warren of Efrafa;
the peaceful aftermath.
One shortcoming is that
although the voices are generally distinct,
many of the rabbits look alike,
and it's hard to tell one gray-brown rabbit from another.
