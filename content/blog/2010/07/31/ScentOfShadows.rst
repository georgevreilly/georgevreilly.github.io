The plot is more than slightly ridiculous.
Young woman discovers that exactly on her 25th birthday
she will come into her hitherto unknown powers and
join the secret superhero zodiacal troupe that
protects Las Vegas from their nemeses.
For her own protection, she must assume the identity of her murdered sister.

It's better than it sounds though.
The heroine is appealing and copes fairly well with the traumatic upending of her life.
