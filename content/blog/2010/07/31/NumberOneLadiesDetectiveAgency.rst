The first of the `The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency`_ series.

Mma Precious Ramotswe sets up a one-woman detective agency in Gaborne,
the capital of her native Botswana.
She is shrewd and observant and makes a go of it, despite the naysayers.
The book is a collection of short episodes, loosely tied together.
Her good nature helps lead her to find satisfactory resolutions
for most of her clients.

Enjoyable, if frothy.
