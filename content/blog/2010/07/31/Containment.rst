Arik is the smartest of the 100 young humans born to the only colony on Venus—\
a colony that needs to develop its independence from Earth.
After he wakes from a three-month coma, he grows to realize that
there is something very wrong going on in the colony.

The book starts off very slowly, with massive amounts of exposition_
that the author apparently couldn't bear to cut.
Later, it develops some interesting ideas and unexpected plot twists,
making it worthwhile.

Available as a `free ebook`_ from the author's website.
