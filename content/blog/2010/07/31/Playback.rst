*Playback* is the last `Philip Marlowe`_ novel completed by Raymond Chandler.
Marlowe is hired to tail a woman who arrives on a train from the East.
He follows her to a small town near San Diego,
where she falls under the influence of a blackmailer—\
and Marlowe starts to fall for her.

Not Chandler's best work\
—one is left feeling that both Chandler and Marlowe
are old and tired and going through the motions—\
but enjoyable none the less.
