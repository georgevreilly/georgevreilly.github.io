First of the `Bulldog Drummond`_ novels.

Bored former army officer, Capt. Hugh Drummond, “late of the Royal Loamshires”,
puts an advertisement in the paper looking for adventure.
He gets more than he expected when a young woman puts him on the trail
of a master criminal who is organizing a would-be socialist putsch.

Entertaining in a square-jawed, stiff-upper-lip sort of way.
