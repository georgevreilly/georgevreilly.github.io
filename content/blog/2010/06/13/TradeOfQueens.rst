Sixth and final book in the *Merchant Princes* series,
sequel to `The Revolution Business`_.

Everything's going to hell in all three parallel worlds,
our United States, the Gruinmarkt, and New Britain.
The conservative faction of the world-walking Clan
has launched a nuclear attack on the U.S.—\
and the U.S. is going strike back, hard.
The only realistic option for the progressive wing
is to find sanctuary in New Britain,
where the monarchy was recently overthrown in a bloody revolution.

Charlie Stross brings the series to a haunting,
nuclear-fired conclusion.
