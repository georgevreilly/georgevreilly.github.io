*The Winds of Dune* is another interquel in the Dune_ franchise,
following on from `Paul of Dune`_,
taking place between *Dune Messiah* and *Children of Dune*.

The Emperor Paul Atreides has disappeared into the desert,
leaving behind his new-born twins
and his half-mad sister Alia as the Regent.
His mother Jessica arrives from Caladan
and comes to understand a great deal about her son's legacy,
and the galaxy-wide Jihad that had grown beyond his control.
