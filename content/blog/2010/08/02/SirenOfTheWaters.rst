Jana Matinova is a senior Slovak police officer
following the trail of a master criminal across half of Europe.
His old rivals think he's dead and are squabbling over his legacy.

The book is more interesting in the long flashbacks to her early career under the Communists
than in the fairly preposterous present-day plot,
which relies too heavily on coincidences and clichés.
