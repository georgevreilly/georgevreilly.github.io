Quick, readable intro to Shakespeare's life and plays,
setting him in the context of the religious and political turmoils
of the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean eras.
You can't do justice to Shakespeare in an hour, of course,
Most useful if you didn't already know anything about him or his work.
