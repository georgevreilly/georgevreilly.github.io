Superspy Devlin, head of the U.S. government's most secret black ops team,
is on the run, apparently having being framed by someone with inside knowledge.

Second-rate ripoff of Robert Ludlum and Tom Clancy.
Ludicrous plot, cliched characters, risible technobabble.
I gave it longer than I should before abandoning it.

Avoid.
