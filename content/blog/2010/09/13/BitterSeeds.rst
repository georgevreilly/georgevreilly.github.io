A German doctor has been training a handful of children for 20 years
to develop superpowers such as precognition and fire starting.
They are the Nazis' secret weapon, swaying the progress of the War.
To stop the Germans from crossing the English Channel,
the British recruit a handful of warlocks
to make a devil's bargain with ancient evil beings.

Told from the viewpoint of one of the German superbeings
and two of the British agents,
we see the terrible costs to each of them,
as they lose their honor and draw close to insanity.

Recommended.
