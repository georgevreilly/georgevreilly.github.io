Diana Ladd is the widow of a man believed to have killed an Indian girl
seven years ago in the Arizona desert.
The girl's grandmother, Rita Antone, is helping Diana rear her son in a remote house.
Now the real killer, Andrew Carlisle, is out of jail,
blaming Diana for his being put away for manslaughter.

Jance weaves together several interesting characters, their backstories, and Indian myths
to make a satisfying thriller.
