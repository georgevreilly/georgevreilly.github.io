Marla Mason is the chief sorcerer of Felport.
She's abrasive, hard-headed, and ruthless enough to stay on the top of the pile.
But a challenger has arisen and she's gone to San Francisco
with her sidekick Rondeau to seek the help of an old friend.
That friend has been murdered by an Aztec sorcerer
who's trying to bring back an Aztec god.

Fast-paced and entertaining.
I found Marla too obnoxious at first, but then she grew on me.
