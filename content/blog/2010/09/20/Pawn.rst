Patrick Bowers PhD is an environmental criminologist for the FBI.
A serial killer who calls himself the Illusionist is killing women in North Carolina
and leading the FBI a merry dance.
There's a major subplot involving another killer and Jonestown.
And Bowers' personal life is complicated by a sullen teenage stepdaughter.

Despite the ludicrous complexity of the plot,
it's an entertaining and relatively thoughtful thriller.
