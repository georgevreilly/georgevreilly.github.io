Deucalion was once the first of Victor Frankenstein's creations.
In 200 years, the monster has grown wise and ethical.
He learns that Victor also still lives—\
Victor is creating a New Race in New Orleans, a race of superhumans loyal to him,
who will destroy ordinary humanity.
Some of the New Race are not quite as loyal to “Father” as he thinks;
some are veering far off their prescribed courses.
Victor is the true monster here, the ultimate mad scientist.

The premise is interesting, but I found the writing to be flat
and by the numbers.
I'll probably read another book or two in the series,
to see if the other co-authors do a better job.
