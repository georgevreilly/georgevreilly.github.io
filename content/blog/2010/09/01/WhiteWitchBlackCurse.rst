Sequel to `The Outlaw Demon Wails`_; best read in sequence.

Rachel Morgan's life is complicated.
She's investigating the murder of her boyfriend, the vampire Kisten.
There's a banshee on the rampage in Cincinatti and the human police want her help.
And she's being shunned by her fellow witches because she's thought to consort with demons.
And then there's her personal life.
That's complicated too.

Entertaining, but far over the top.
