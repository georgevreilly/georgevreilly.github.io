Sequel to `The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo`_.

Mikael Blomkvist's *Millennium* magazine is about to publish an exposé
of sex trafficking in Sweden, when the two researchers are gunned down.
Lisabeth Salendar's prints are on the gun and she immediately becomes
the most wanted woman in Sweden—but it's not so easy to catch her.
We learn a great deal about Salander's traumatic past by the end of the book.

While the book is enthralling—I read it in less than a day—it's not especially well-written.
The plot is often ludicrous, relying heavily on improbable coincidences,
and the characters can be implausible.
Even so, I scarcely put the book down until I finished it.
