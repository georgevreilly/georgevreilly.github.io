Dr. Sara Linton and her husband, police chief Jeffrey Tolliver,
travel to a small Georgia town to find out why Jeffrey's detective,
Lena Adams, has been found beside a burnt-out car with a corpse.
They uncover a lot of dirty secrets in Reese, including neo-Nazis and drugrunning.

I found the plot gripping but also unpleasant.
Slaughter seems to enjoy torturing her characters.
