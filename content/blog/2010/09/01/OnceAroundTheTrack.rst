Badger Jenkins is a shy, unassuming NASCAR driver with
chiseled cheekbones and a rabid fanbase.
He's recruited to drive for the first otherwise-all-female team.
For several months, we follow Badger and several of the women
who work in the crew or behind the scenes,
as the team coalesces and the season progresses.

This is an entertaining and well-written look at NASCAR racing
from the perspective of insiders.
We learn a great deal about the sport and what it takes to run a NASCAR team.
We also get to see Badger from several viewpoints,
ranging from the tongue-tied hero worshipper to the gruff crew chief.
Most of the time, he's an irresponsible country boy who just wants to fish on his lake,
but when he dons his fire suit, he becomes dangerous, almost irresistible, and wholly focused.

Recommended.
