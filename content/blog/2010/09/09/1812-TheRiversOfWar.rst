`1812\: The Rivers of War`_ is the first novel in an alternate history
series that recasts the `War of 1812`_ and later the `Trail of Tears`_.
Sam Houston, Andrew Jackson, and several Scots-Irish and Indian characters
head off in a somewhat different direction than they did in our history.

Flint tells a rousing, entertaining story, with exciting battles and engaging characters.
It's a period of U.S. history that I knew little about,
and I enjoyed the book.
