In the year Eighteen-Six, it has been two hundred years
since last a *practical* magician walked in England,
when Mr. Norrell shews himself after many years of study.
In time, he is joined by a student Jonathan Strange
who later distinguishes himself in the Peninsular War against the tyrant Bonaparte.
But their most dangerous adversary is the
capricious gentleman with the thistle-down hair from Faerie.

Susanna Clarke's debut novel is a startling take on fantasy,
evoking the work of Austen and Dickens,
pitting madness against reason,
exploring magic and Englishness.

Highly recommended.
