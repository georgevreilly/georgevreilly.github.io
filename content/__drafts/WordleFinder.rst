Unless YOUVE LIVED UNDER ROCKS, you've heard of Wordle_,
the wildly popular web-based word game.

.. _Wordle:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle

.. ./render_game.py RISKY=r...Y CRAZY=.ra.Y WEARY=..arY MARRY=.AR.Y PARTY=PARTY

.. raw:: html

    <table class='wordle'>
      <tr><td class="present">R</td> <td class="absent" >I</td> <td class="absent" >S</td> <td class="absent" >K</td> <td class="correct">Y</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="absent" >C</td> <td class="present">R</td> <td class="present">A</td> <td class="absent" >Z</td> <td class="correct">Y</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="absent" >W</td> <td class="absent" >E</td> <td class="present">A</td> <td class="present">R</td> <td class="correct">Y</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="absent" >M</td> <td class="correct">A</td> <td class="correct">R</td> <td class="absent" >R</td> <td class="correct">Y</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="correct">P</td> <td class="correct">A</td> <td class="correct">R</td> <td class="correct">T</td> <td class="correct">Y</td></tr>
    </table>

The letters of each guess are colored Green, Yellow, or Black (dark-gray).

* A Green letter ðŸŸ© means that the letter is *correct*:
  the final letter is ``Y``.
* A Yellow letter ðŸŸ¨ means that the letter is *present* elsewhere in the word:
  there is an ``R`` in the word;
  it's not at positions 1, 2, or 4 but at position 3.
* A Black letter â¬› is *absent* from the answer:
  there is no ``I``, ``S``, ``K``, ``C``, ``Z``, ``W``, ``E``, or ``M``
  anywhere in ``PARTY``.

The problem that I want to address in this post is:

    Given a set of ``GUESS=SCORE`` pairs and a word list,
    find all the words from the list that are candidate answers.

Other words that could satisfy
``RISKY=r...Y CRAZY=.ra.Y WEARY=..arY MARRY=.AR.Y`` include
``HARDY HARPY TARDY TARTY``.

The ``GUESS=SCORE`` notation is intended to be clear
and easier to write than Greens and Yellows.
Example: For ``CRAZY=.ra.Y``:

.. raw:: html

    <table class='wordle'>
      <tr><td class="absent" >C</td> <td class="present">R</td> <td class="present">A</td> <td class="absent" >Z</td> <td class="correct">Y</td></tr>
    </table>

* the ``Y`` is in the correct position (i.e., green ðŸŸ©),
* the ``r`` and ``a`` are present somewhere in the answer,
  but they are in the wrong positions (yellow ðŸŸ¨),
* and ``C`` and ``Z`` are absent from the answer (black â¬› / white â¬œ).


Deductions
----------

What can we deduce from the first four rows of guesses,
``RISKY=r...Y CRAZY=.ra.Y WEARY=..arY MARRY=.AR.Y``?

There is a set of *valid* letters,
``Y``, ``A``, and ``R``,
that are either *present* (yellow ðŸŸ¨) or *correct* (green ðŸŸ©):
The ``Y`` is correct from the first time it appears.
The ``A`` and ``R`` are initially present,
but later find their correct position.

There is a set of *invalid* letters that are
known to be *absent* from the answer (black â¬›):
``I``, ``S``, ``K``, ``C``, ``Z``, ``W``, ``E``, and ``M``.

The remaining letters of the alphabet are currently *unknown*.
If they are played, they will turn into *valid* or *invalid* letters.
Unless we already have five correct letters,
we will draw candidate letters from the unknown pool.

Furthermore, we know something about *letter positions*.
The *correct* letters are in the correct positions,
while the *present* letters are in the wrong positions.

A candidate word *must*:

1. include all valid letters
2. exclude all invalid letters
3. match all correct positions
4. not match any â€˜presentâ€™ positions

These constraints narrow the possible choices from the word list.
