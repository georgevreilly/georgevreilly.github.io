Unless YOUVE LIVED UNDER ROCKS, you've heard of Wordle_,
the online word game that has become wildly popular since late 2021.
You've almost certainly seen people posting their Wordle games
as little green, yellow, and black (or white) emojis.

|   Wordle 797 4/6

|   â¬› â¬› â¬› â¬› ðŸŸ¨
|   ðŸŸ¨ â¬› ðŸŸ© â¬› â¬›
|   â¬› â¬› ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ¨ â¬›
|   ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ©


The problem that I want to address in this post is:

    Given some ``GUESS=SCORE`` pairs for Wordle and a word list,
    find all the words from the list that are candidate answers.

Let's look at this four-round game for Wordle 797:

.. JUDGE=....e CHEST=c.E.. WRECK=..Ec. OCEAN=OCEAN

.. raw:: html

    <table class='wordle'>
      <tr><td class="absent" >J</td> <td class="absent" >U</td> <td class="absent" >D</td> <td class="absent" >G</td> <td class="present">E</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="present">C</td> <td class="absent" >H</td> <td class="correct">E</td> <td class="absent" >S</td> <td class="absent" >T</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="absent" >W</td> <td class="absent" >R</td> <td class="correct">E</td> <td class="present">C</td> <td class="absent" >K</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="correct">O</td> <td class="correct">C</td> <td class="correct">E</td> <td class="correct">A</td> <td class="correct">N</td></tr>
    </table>

The letters of each guess are colored Green, Yellow, or Black (dark-gray).

* A Green letter ðŸŸ© means that the letter is *correct*:
  ``N`` is the final letter of the answer.
* A Yellow letter ðŸŸ¨ means that the letter is *present* elsewhere in the answer.
  There is a ``C`` in the answer;
  it's not at positions 1 or 4, but it is correct at position 2.
  Likewise, an ``E`` is present in the answer;
  it's not at position 5, but it's correct at position 3.
* A Black letter â¬› is *absent* from the answer:
  there is no ``J``, ``U``, ``D``, ``G``,
  ``H``, ``S``, ``T``,
  ``W``, ``R``, or ``K``
  anywhere in ``OCEAN``.

Other words that could satisfy
``JUDGE=....e CHEST=c.E.. WRECK=..Ec.``
are ``ICENI``, ``ILEAC``, and ``OLEIC``â€”\
none of which is plausible as a Wordle answer.

The ``GUESS=SCORE`` notation is intended to be clear to read
and easier to write than Greens and Yellows.
For example:

.. raw:: html

    <table class='wordle'>
      <tr><td class="present">C</td> <td class="absent" >H</td> <td class="correct">E</td> <td class="absent" >S</td> <td class="absent" >T</td></tr>
    </table>

    <div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace; font-size: 48px;">
        <span>CHEST=c.E..</span>
    </div>

* the ``E`` is in the correct position (i.e., green ðŸŸ©);
* the ``c`` is  present somewhere in the answer,
  but it is in the wrong position (yellow ðŸŸ¨);
* the ``.``\ s in the score denote that the corresponding letters in the guess
  (``H``, ``S``, and ``T``)
  are absent from the answer (black â¬›).


Deductions
----------

What can we deduce from the first three rows of guesses,
``JUDGE=....e CHEST=c.E.. WRECK=..Ec.``?

There is a set of *valid* letters,
``C`` and ``E``,
that are either *present* (yellow ðŸŸ¨) or *correct* (green ðŸŸ©).
Both ``E`` and ``C`` are initially present,
but ``E`` later finds its correct position,
while ``C`` does not.

There is a set of *invalid* letters that are
known to be *absent* from the answer (black â¬›):
``J``, ``U``, ``D``, ``G``, ``H``, ``S``, ``T``, ``W``, ``R``, and ``K``.

The remaining letters of the alphabet are currently *unknown*.
When they are played, they will turn into *valid* or *invalid* letters.
Unless we already have all five correct letters,
we will draw candidate letters from the unknown pool.

Furthermore, we know something about *letter positions*.
The *correct* letters are in the correct positions,
while the *present* letters are in the wrong positions.

A candidate word *must*:

1. include all valid letters â€”          ``C`` and ``E``
2. exclude all invalid letters â€”        ``J``, ``U``, ``D``, ``G``, ``H``, ``S``, ``T``,
   ``W``, ``R``, and ``K``
3. match all correct positions â€”        ``3:E``
4. not match any â€˜presentâ€™ positions â€”  ``1:C``, ``4:C``, or ``5:E``

These constraints narrow the possible choices from the word list.


Prototyping with Pipes
----------------------

Let's prototype the above constraints with a series of ``grep``\ s
in a Unix pipeline tailored to this ``OCEAN`` example:

.. code-block:: bash

    # JUDGE=....e CHEST=c.E.. WRECK=..Ec.

    grep '^.....$' /usr/share/dict/words |  # Five-letter words
        tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' |                    # Translate to uppercase
        grep '^..E..$' |                    # Match CORRECT positions
        awk '/C/ && /E/' |                  # Match ALL of VALID set, CORRECT|PRESENT
        grep -v '[JUDGHSTWRK]' |            # Exclude INVALID set
        grep '^[^C]..[^C][^E]$'             # Exclude PRESENT positions

gives (in Bash, on macOS 13.4)::

    ICENI
    ILEAC
    OCEAN
    OLEIC

Let's try it for Wordle 787 (``INDEX``):

.. code-block:: bash

    # VOUCH=..... GRIPE=..i.e DENIM=deni. WIDEN=.iDEn

    grep '^.....$' /usr/share/dict/words |
        tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' |
        grep '^..DE.$' |                    # CORRECT pos
        awk '/D/ && /E/ && /I/ && /N/' |    # VALID set
        grep -v '[VOUCHGRPMW]' |            # INVALID set
        grep '^[^D][^EI][^I][^I][^EN]$'     # PRESENT pos

yields::

    INDEX

This approach is promising, but not maintainable.





.. Sticking the stylesheet at the end out of the way
.. raw:: html

    <style>
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Libre+Franklin:wght@700&display=swap');
    table.wordle {

        font-weight: bold;
        border-spacing: 6px;
        margin-left: auto;
        margin-right: auto;
    }
    table tr td {
        color: white;
        background-color: white;
        height: 62px;
        width: 62px;
        text-align: center;
    }
    table tr td.correct {
        background-color: #6aaa64;
    }
    table tr td.present {
        background-color: #c9b458;
    }
    table tr td.absent {
        background-color: #838184;
    }
    </style>
