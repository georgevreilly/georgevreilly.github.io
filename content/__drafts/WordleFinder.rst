Unless YOUVE LIVED UNDER ROCKS, you've heard of Wordle_,
the online word game that has become wildly popular since late 2021.
You've almost certainly seen people posting their Wordle games
as little green, yellow, and black (or white) emojis.

.. _Wordle:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle

Take this five-round game:

.. ./render_game.py RISKY=r...Y CRAZY=.ra.Y WEARY=..arY MARRY=.AR.Y PARTY=PARTY

.. raw:: html

    <table class='wordle'>
      <tr><td class="present">R</td> <td class="absent" >I</td> <td class="absent" >S</td> <td class="absent" >K</td> <td class="correct">Y</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="absent" >C</td> <td class="present">R</td> <td class="present">A</td> <td class="absent" >Z</td> <td class="correct">Y</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="absent" >W</td> <td class="absent" >E</td> <td class="present">A</td> <td class="present">R</td> <td class="correct">Y</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="absent" >M</td> <td class="correct">A</td> <td class="correct">R</td> <td class="absent" >R</td> <td class="correct">Y</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="correct">P</td> <td class="correct">A</td> <td class="correct">R</td> <td class="correct">T</td> <td class="correct">Y</td></tr>
    </table>

The letters of each guess are colored Green, Yellow, or Black (dark-gray).

* A Green letter ðŸŸ© means that the letter is *correct*:
  the final letter of the answer is ``Y``.
* A Yellow letter ðŸŸ¨ means that the letter is *present* elsewhere in the answer.
  There is an ``R`` in the answer;
  it's not at positions 1, 2, or 4, but it is at position 3.
  Likewise, an ``A`` is present in the answer,
  not at position 3, but at position 2.
* A Black letter â¬› is *absent* from the answer:
  there is no ``I``, ``S``, ``K``, ``C``, ``Z``, ``W``, ``E``, or ``M``
  anywhere in ``PARTY``.

The problem that I want to address in this post is:

    Given a set of ``GUESS=SCORE`` pairs and a word list,
    find all the words from the list that are candidate answers.

Other words that could satisfy
``RISKY=r...Y CRAZY=.ra.Y WEARY=..arY MARRY=.AR.Y``
include but are not limited to
``HARDY HARPY TARDY TARTY``.

The ``GUESS=SCORE`` notation is intended to be clear to read
and easier to write than Greens and Yellows.

For example, ``CRAZY=.ra.Y``:

.. raw:: html

    <table class='wordle'>
      <tr><td class="absent" >C</td> <td class="present">R</td> <td class="present">A</td> <td class="absent" >Z</td> <td class="correct">Y</td></tr>
    </table>

* the ``Y`` is in the correct position (i.e., green ðŸŸ©),
* the ``r`` and ``a`` are present somewhere in the answer,
  but they are in the wrong positions (yellow ðŸŸ¨),
* and ``C`` and ``Z`` are absent from the answer (black â¬›).


Deductions
----------

What can we deduce from the first four rows of guesses,
``RISKY=r...Y CRAZY=.ra.Y WEARY=..arY MARRY=.AR.Y``?

There is a set of *valid* letters,
``Y``, ``A``, and ``R``,
that are either *present* (yellow ðŸŸ¨) or *correct* (green ðŸŸ©):
The ``Y`` is correct from the first time it appears.
The ``A`` and ``R`` are initially present,
but later find their correct position.

There is a set of *invalid* letters that are
known to be *absent* from the answer (black â¬›):
``I``, ``S``, ``K``, ``C``, ``Z``, ``W``, ``E``, and ``M``.

The remaining letters of the alphabet are currently *unknown*.
When they are played, they will turn into *valid* or *invalid* letters.
Unless we already have five correct letters,
we will draw candidate letters from the unknown pool.

Furthermore, we know something about *letter positions*.
The *correct* letters are in the correct positions,
while the *present* letters are in the wrong positions.

A candidate word *must*:

1. include all valid letters â€”          ``Y``, ``A``, and ``R``
2. exclude all invalid letters â€”        ``I``, ``S``, ``K``, ``C``, ``Z``, ``W``, ``E``, and ``M``
3. match all correct positions â€”        ``A=2``, ``R=3``, and ``Y=5``
4. not match any â€˜presentâ€™ positions â€”  ``R=1``, ``R=2``, ``R=4``, or ``A=3``

These constraints narrow the possible choices from the word list.
