Unless YOUVE LIVED UNDER ROCKS, you've heard of Wordle_,
the online word game that has become wildly popular since late 2021.
You've almost certainly seen people posting their Wordle games
as little green, yellow, and black (or white) emojis.

|   Wordle 797 4/6

|   â¬› â¬› â¬› â¬› ðŸŸ¨

|   â¬› â¬› ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ¨ â¬›
|   ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ©


The problem that I want to address in this post is:

    Given some ``GUESS=SCORE`` pairs for Wordle and a word list,
    find all the words from the list that are candidate answers.

Let's look at this four-round game for Wordle 797:

.. JUDGE=....e CHEST=c.E.. WRECK=..Ec. OCEAN=OCEAN

.. raw:: html

    <table class='wordle'>
      <tr><td class="absent" >J</td> <td class="absent" >U</td> <td class="absent" >D</td> <td class="absent" >G</td> <td class="present">E</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="present">C</td> <td class="absent" >H</td> <td class="correct">E</td> <td class="absent" >S</td> <td class="absent" >T</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="absent" >W</td> <td class="absent" >R</td> <td class="correct">E</td> <td class="present">C</td> <td class="absent" >K</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="correct">O</td> <td class="correct">C</td> <td class="correct">E</td> <td class="correct">A</td> <td class="correct">N</td></tr>
    </table>

The letters of each guess are colored Green, Yellow, or Black (dark-gray).

* A Green letter ðŸŸ© means that the letter is *correct*:
  ``N`` is the final letter of the answer.
* A Yellow letter ðŸŸ¨ means that the letter is *present* elsewhere in the answer.
  There is a ``C`` in the answer;
  it's not at positions 1 or 4, but it is correct at position 2.
  Likewise, an ``E`` is present in the answer;
  it's not at position 5, but it's correct at position 3.
* A Black letter â¬› is *absent* from the answer:
  there is no ``J``, ``U``, ``D``, ``G``,
  ``H``, ``S``, ``T``,
  ``W``, ``R``, or ``K``
  anywhere in ``OCEAN``.

Other words that could satisfy
``JUDGE=....e CHEST=c.E.. WRECK=..Ec.``
are ``ICENI``, ``ILEAC``, and ``OLEIC``â€”\
none of which is plausible as a Wordle answer.

The ``GUESS=SCORE`` notation is intended to be clear to read
and easier to write than Greens and Yellows.
For example:

.. raw:: html

    <div style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace; font-size: 48px;">
        <div><i>GUESS=SCORE</i></div>
        <div>CHEST=c.E..</div>
    </div>

    <table class='wordle'>
      <tr><td class="present">C</td> <td class="absent" >H</td> <td class="correct">E</td> <td class="absent" >S</td> <td class="absent" >T</td></tr>
    </table>

* the uppercase ``E`` at position 3 in the score denotes that
  ``E`` is in the correct position (i.e., green ðŸŸ©);
* the lowercase ``c`` at position 1 in the score denotes that
  ``C`` is  present somewhere in the answer,
  but it is in the wrong position (yellow ðŸŸ¨);
* the ``.``\ s in the score at positions 2, 4, and 5 denote that
  the corresponding letters in the guess (``H``, ``S``, and ``T``)
  are absent from the answer (black â¬›).


Deductions
----------

What can we deduce from the first three rows of guesses,
``JUDGE=....e CHEST=c.E.. WRECK=..Ec.``?

There is a set of *valid* letters,
``C`` and ``E``,
that are either *present* (yellow ðŸŸ¨) or *correct* (green ðŸŸ©).
Both ``E`` and ``C`` are initially present,
but ``E`` later finds its correct position,
while ``C`` does not.

There is a set of *invalid* letters that are
known to be *absent* from the answer (black â¬›):
``J``, ``U``, ``D``, ``G``, ``H``, ``S``, ``T``, ``W``, ``R``, and ``K``.

The remaining letters of the alphabet are currently *unknown*.
When they are played, they will turn into *valid* or *invalid* letters.
Unless we already have all five correct letters,
we will draw candidate letters from the unknown pool.

Furthermore, we know something about *letter positions*.
The *correct* letters are in the correct positions,
while the *present* letters are in the wrong positions.

A candidate word *must*:

1. include all valid letters â€”          ``C`` and ``E``
2. exclude all invalid letters â€”        ``JUDGHSTWRK``
3. match all correct positions â€”        ``3:E``
4. not match any â€˜presentâ€™ positions â€”  ``1:C``, ``4:C``, or ``5:E``

These constraints narrow the possible choices from the word list.


Prototyping with Pipes
----------------------

Let's prototype the above constraints with a series of ``grep``\ s
in a Unix pipeline tailored to this ``OCEAN`` example:

.. code-block:: bash

    # TODO why is alignment messed up?

    # JUDGE=....e CHEST=c.E.. WRECK=..Ec.

    grep '^.....$' /usr/share/dict/words |  # Five-letter words
        tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' |                    # Translate to uppercase
        grep '^..E..$' |                    # Match CORRECT positions
        awk '/C/ && /E/' |                  # Match ALL of VALID set, CORRECT|PRESENT
        grep -v '[JUDGHSTWRK]' |            # Exclude INVALID set
        grep '^[^C]..[^C][^E]$'             # Exclude PRESENT positions

gives (in Bash, on macOS 13.4)::

    ICENI
    ILEAC
    OCEAN
    OLEIC

We can accomplish this with only the simplest features of regular expressions,
the `dot metacharacter`_ (``.``),
`character classes`_ (``[JUD...]``) and negated character classes (``[^E]``),
and the ``^`` and ``$`` `anchors`_.
Awk gives us `regex conjunctions`_.

.. _anchors:
    https://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html
.. _regex conjunctions:
    /blog/2023/09/05/RegexConjunctions.html

Let's try our pipeline for Wordle 787 (``INDEX``):

.. code-block:: bash

    # VOUCH=..... GRIPE=..i.e DENIM=deni. WIDEN=.iDEn

    grep '^.....$' /usr/share/dict/words |
        tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' |
        grep '^..DE.$' |                    # CORRECT pos
        awk '/D/ && /E/ && /I/ && /N/' |    # VALID set
        grep -v '[VOUCHGRPMW]' |            # INVALID set
        grep '^[^D][^EI][^I][^I][^EN]$'     # PRESENT pos

yields::

    INDEX

This approach is promising, but not maintainable.


Initial Python Solution
-----------------------

Let's attempt to solve this in Python.
The first piece is to parse a list of ``GUESS=SCORE`` pairs.

.. code-block:: python

    def parse_guesses(guess_scores):
        invalid = set()  # Black/Absent
        valid = set()  # Green or Yellow
        mask = [None] * 5  # Exact match for position (Green/Correct)
        wrong_spot = [set() for _ in range(5)]  # Wrong spot (Yellow/Present)
        for guess in guess_scores:
            word, result = guess.split("=")
            for i, (w, r) in enumerate(zip(word, result)):
                assert "A" <= w <= "Z", "WORD should be uppercase"
                if "A" <= r <= "Z":
                    valid.add(w)
                    mask[i] = w
                elif "a" <= r <= "z":
                    valid.add(w)
                    wrong_spot[i].add(w)
                elif r == ".":
                    invalid.add(w)
                else:
                    raise ValueError(f"Unexpected {r} for {w}")
        return (invalid, valid, mask, wrong_spot)

Here's how we use the parsed data:

.. code-block:: python

    def is_eligible(word, invalid, valid, mask, wrong_spot):
        letters = {c for c in word}
        if letters & valid != valid:
            # Missing some 'valid' letters
            trace(f"!Valid: {word}")
            return False
        elif letters & invalid:
            trace(f"Invalid: {word}")
            return False
        elif any(m is not None and c != m for c, m in zip(word, mask)):
            # Some of the Green/Correct letters are missing
            trace(f"!Mask: {word}")
            return False
        elif any(c in ws for c, ws in zip(word, wrong_spot)):
            # We have Yellow letters
            trace(f"WrongSpot: {word}")
            return False
        else:
            trace(f"Got: {word}")
            return True

Classes
-------

Returning four parallel collections from a function is a `code smell`_.
Let's refactor this into a class.

First, we'll need some helper classes:
``TileState``, a `multi-attribute enumeration`_, and ``GuessScore``.

.. _code smell:
    https://pragmaticways.com/31-code-smells-you-must-know/
.. _multi-attribute enumeration:
    /blog/2023/09/02/PythonEnumsWithAttributes.html

.. code-block:: python

    class TileState(namedtuple("TileState", "value emoji color css_color"), Enum):
        CORRECT = 1, "\U0001F7E9", "Green",  "#6aaa64"
        PRESENT = 2, "\U0001F7E8", "Yellow", "#c9b458"
        ABSENT  = 3, "\U00002B1B", "Black",  "#838184"



Old
===

And how we call ``is_eligible``:

.. code-block:: python

    def main():
        namespace = parse_args()
        with open(namespace.word_file) as f:
            WORDS = [w.upper().strip() for w in f
                     if len(w.strip()) == WORDLE_LEN]
        invalid, valid, mask, wrong_spot = parse_guesses(namespace.guess_scores)
        choices = [w for w in WORDS if is_eligible(w, invalid, valid, mask, wrong_spot)]
        print("\n".join(choices))

For the sake of completeness, here's the rest:

.. code-block:: python

    _VERBOSITY = 0

    def debug(s):
        if _VERBOSITY: print(s)

    def trace(s):
        if _VERBOSITY >= 2: print(s)

    def parse_args():
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Wordle Finder")
        parser.set_defaults(
            word_file="/usr/share/dict/words",
            verbose=0,
        )
        parser.add_argument(
            "--verbose", "-v", action="count", help="Show all the steps")
        parser.add_argument(
            "--word-file", "-w", help="Word file. Default: %(default)s")
        parser.add_argument(
            "guess_scores",
            nargs="+",
            metavar="GUESS=score",
            help="Examples: 'ARISE=.r.se' 'ROUTE=R.u.e' 'RULES=Ru.eS'",
        )
        namespace = parser.parse_args()
        global _VERBOSITY
        _VERBOSITY = namespace.verbose
        return namespace

Let's try it!::

    $ ./wordle.py HARES=.ar.. GUILT=..... CROAK=.Roa. BRAVO=bRa.o
    ARBOR

    $ ./wordle1.py CHAIR=Cha.. CLASH=C.a.h CATCH=CA.ch
    CACHE
    CAHOW

    $ ./wordle1.py LEAKS=..... MIGHT=.i..t BLITZ=..it. OPTIC=o.tIC TONIC=TO.IC
    TORIC
    TOXIC

This looks right
but there are a couple of subtle bugs here.
We'll come back to those.

Class

Bugs
----

``FIFTY: HARES=..... BUILT=..i.t TIMID=tI... PINTO=.I.T. WITTY=.I.TY``
can be fixed by inserting ``if w not in valid``
between ``elif r == "."`` and ``invalid.add(w)``.
But this returns too many results.

We need the per-position ``invalid`` for these:

* ``QUICK: MORAL=..... TWINE=..I.. CHICK=..ICK`` doesn't find ``QUICK``
* ``STYLE: `GROAN=..... WHILE=...LE BELLE=...LE TUPLE=t..LE STELE=ST.LE``
  finds both ``STYLE`` and ``STELE`` (which is known to be wrong)
