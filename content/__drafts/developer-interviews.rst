There's a lot of buzz lately about developer interviews, sparked by some
posts about the `FizzBuzz`_ screening problem.

I'm no fan of the brain teaser interviews that used to be so popular at
Microsoft. I find them profoundly worthless.
Nor do I think much of the write-a-complex-algorithm-on-the-whiteboard
questions that were so popular at Microsoft.
I think they have little predictive value in measuring the value
of a software engineer.

I want to talk about part of the interview process for developers at `Atlas`_.
After the initial phone screen, promising candidates are
invited in for several hours of interviews.
In addition to talking to the recruiter, the dev manager, and the
program manager, there are at least three interviews with the dev team:
modeling, coding, and team fit.

In the modeling interview, we ask you to model something on the whiteboard.
We're looking to see how well you grasp object orientation, design,
behaviors, responsibilities, and changing requirements.
No code is written during this interview.
It won't hurt if you know a little UML and some design patterns,
but we value good communication skills over OO purity.
Personally, when I was on the receiving end of this interview,
I found it to be one of the most useful and enjoyable interviews
that I had ever done.
Bouncing ideas off the interviewer was a lot of fun.

In the team fit interview, two or three members of the dev team
sit down with you and interact socially, often over lunch.
It's important to us that you're going to mesh well with the team.
It's also an opportunity for us to sell you on working here.
Good people are hard to find and we don't want to lose you
because we left you with a poor impression of us.

I've worked with two different teams and they take very different
approaches to the coding interview.

One team gives you a written test
