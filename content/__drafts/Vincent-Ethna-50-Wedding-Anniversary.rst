Today is my parents' 50th Wedding Anniversary.
They celebrated in Cape Town, where they now spend much of the year,
with various South African and Irish friends.
My cousin Storm delivered the following speech on my behalf.

The Speech
----------

Good afternoon!
I wish I could be with you in person today,
but I'm 10,000 miles away in Seattle, on the west coast of the United States.
Thanks to my cousin Storm for acting in my stead.

I'd like to bring you back 50 years,
to March 30th, 1964, to Rathgar Church in Dublin.
Easter Monday 1964.
Lent is over, it's a glorious spring day and Ireland is at its best.
It's the biggest day in the lives of
Ethna Clery and Vincent Reilly—their wedding day.
Most of the people they know—\
their families, their friends, their parents' friends—\
are all there in Rathgar Church.

On the Clery side are her parents, George and Ethna Senior.
It's the second wedding for them that year:
their older son, Dick, married Anne two months earlier.
Their other daughters, Joan and Georgina, are there, dressed as bridesmaids.
And their younger son, Gabriel, who turned 15 the week before.

Vincent's parents, Paddy and Kathleen Reilly, are there too,
with their three daughters, Philda and Katherine and Hilary.
Vincent is the oldest and the only son,
and he's the first of the Reillys to get married.

This wedding day has long been coming.
Ethna and Vincent met in late '57, when they were both 18.
They've been going out together forever;
they've been engaged for years and years.
They've been scrimping and saving, to afford a little house in Ranelagh.
Both of them work at the Munster & Leinster bank—\
as have generations of Clerys—\
but it doesn't pay much.
Vincent has three jobs;
soon, Ethna will be taking in lodgers.

No matter!
This is their day.
Everyone's dressed to the nines.
The men in the wedding party are in morning suits and top hats.
Vincent looks particularly dapper.
He's young and lean and handsome, and he wears a suit well.
Ethna is radiant, in her white wedding dress,
the most beautiful woman present,
when she walks into the church on her father's arm.

George Clery must have been very proud as he led his daughter up the aisle.
Ethna is the middle daughter,
but the first of the three Clery girls to be married.
He likes Vincent and so does Ethna Senior.
Today is also George Clery's 64th birthday,
he's retiring from running the Rathgar branch of the Munster & Leinster,
and life doesn't get much better than this.

George gives her away at the altar.
The wedding proceeds.
Vincent and Ethna say their vows and they are pronounced man and wife.
When they leave the church,
they receive a salute from the pack of Brownie Girl Guides that Ethna leads.

And so their new life together begins.
After six years of dating, they are finally married.
Soon there's a baby on the way—me!
Sadly, George Clery doesn't live to celebrate his 65th birthday,
which is also Ethna and Vincent's first wedding anniversary.
He dies on March 3rd, 1965.
Twelve days later, I was born,
the first grandchild for both the Clerys and the Reilly.
I was named George Vincent,
in his honor and after my father.

Three more children follow:
David in '67, Michelle in '70, Mark in '73.
Ethna stays home:
the bank doesn't want married women with children on their staff.
Those first few years were tight financially,
but that was true of most of their friends at the time.
In '69, Vincent seizes an opportunity
and joins the new Allied Irish Investment Bank,
where his career takes off.
They move to a larger, newer house in Rathfarnham later that year.
In 1972, a Dutch merchant bank, Algemene Bank Nederland,
sets up office in Dublin and asks Vincent to be their number two man.
In 1975, Vincent and Ethna buy a large old house near Palmerston Park.
The house has great bones, but it needs a lot of work.
Ethna spends months organizing the renovation.
The house looks wonderful when we finally move in.
By 1976, Vincent is running ABN's operation in Ireland.

These were good years for all of us.
Vincent and Ethna have four young children,
they're prospering and healthy,
and their family and friends are doing well.
Ethna was made for motherhood—and grandmotherhood!
She was deeply involved in our childhoods,
loving us, caring for us, always there with a kind word.
And feeding us well too.
As Vincent's career advanced and Ethna hosted a lot of dinner parties,
she became a versatile and adventurous cook before it was really fashionable.
Vincent was always a devoted and thoughtful husband to Ethna.
As children, we found him a little forbidding.
He's mellowed since then and we appreciate him a lot more now.

My Confirmation took place on the day of their thirteenth wedding anniversary,
so they had the photographer take their portrait too.
They look so young and elegant and very happy in that portrait.

Ethna and Vincent continue to look elegant and happy together,
if not quite so young.
Their children are long grown—\
we're all in our forties now—\
and we have spouses and children of our own.
The three grandchildren—Michelle's Harry and Hannah and Mark's Roxy—\
were all born in the last five years.
Ethna came to being a grandmother later than most of her peers,
but she's reveled in it.
Those three kids are just as lucky to have Ethna as a grandmother,
as we were to have her as a mother.
Vincent's less effusive about it,
but you can see his pride too
in his children and grandchildren.

In August, all of the Reilly family—\
Vincent and Ethna;
George Reilly and Emma Bartholomew;
David Reilly;
Michelle and David Bowles, Harry and Hannah;
and Mark Reilly and Lizzy McGlynn and Roxy—\
we're all reuniting for a week at a farmhouse in France.
We're celebrating not only Ethna and Vincent's 50th Wedding Anniversary,
but also their 75th birthdays, which take place in July and August.
We're all looking forward to that week.

I wish I could be there with you all today too, but I can't.

I leave you now with a toast.

To Ethna and Vincent!
To Fifty Years of Marriage!
To a Long and Happy Life Together!
And to Many More Years to Come!
Vincent and Ethna!
