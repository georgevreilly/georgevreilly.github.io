<p>I had a <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/03/23/MoleRemoval.html">mole excised</a> from my lower calf three weeks ago,
after a biopsy found that it was “abnormal”.
The biopsy on the excised remainder came back clean.
I went back to the surgeon's office during the week to have the stitches removed.
It turns out that the stitches were dis&shy;solv&shy;able,
but I hadn't peeled back the wrapping to take a look.
I was given the all-clear to resume exercising
and for the rest of the week, I cycled to the office.
Today was my first run:
a 3-mile course to the Seward Park Caffè Vita.
The scar didn't bother me, but I had to stop and walk a <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/04/17/RunningAfterStitches.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>I shared a house with my friend Muhsin in the mid-90s.
Muhsin is a runner so I started running too,
but I lost the habit not long after I moved in with Emma in '98.</p>
<p>A little over a year ago, I went down to the Bay Area for work.
I spent the weekend staying with old friends from Ireland, Paul and Maggie.
Paul had been run down by a car while cycling at twilight at Christmas 2013.
As part of his recovery, he had taken up running,
and a few weeks before my trip, he challenged me to join him in a 5K run for charity.</p>
<p>And <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2015/12/24/Running.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
