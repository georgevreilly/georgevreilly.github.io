here's how to fold a t-shirt:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Lay shirt face-up on a smooth surface, long side facing you,
with the neck on your left.
With the edge of your hand, draw an imaginary line from shoulder to hem on the far side.
Along this line, pinch the shirt with your left hand at the shoulder
and with your right at the middle of the chest.</li>
<li>Fold the shoulder over, crossing left hand over right,
to meet the hem along this line.
Now pinch the hem and shoulder together with your left fingers.</li>
<li>Lift the shirt and uncross your hands, pulling the shirt taut.

<p>I bought a new strimmer last weekend and used it agres&shy;sive&shy;ly today,
revealing a once grass-covered pathway that I hadn't seen in years
and edging the parkway in front of my house very neatly.
Naturally, I exhausted the line on the spool.
I bought refill line and wound it onto the spool.
It seems to work better than on my previous strimmer,
which would jam or break every couple of minutes.
I took more care than in the past and I very carefully and snugly wound the line,
trying to minimize crossings or loose areas.
I've seen a rec&shy;om&shy;men&shy;da&shy;tion to <a class="reference external" href="http://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/9401/3163">soak the line</a> to make it more pliable.

<p>I assembled a couple of adjustable shelving units today.
Trying to count the same number of in&shy;den&shy;ta&shy;tions on all four legs for each level
quickly grew tedious, and I realized that I needed to make a story stick.
I cut a &quot;stick&quot; to the right length
and then I was able to place the stick along the leg
and instantly read where the next pair of snap rings should be placed.
I mentioned this to Emma and she had never heard of story sticks.</p>

<p>When I posted a link to the new <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/2015/01/leatherman-tread/">Leatherman Tread Bracelet</a> on Facebook
the other day, I mentioned that I had recently forfeited a little Swiss Army knife
that I'd owned for 30 years at airport security.
The Tread is a bracelet where each link has one or more mini-tools.
The bracelet itself is about $150â€“$200, depending upon the exact tools.
With a watch, it's about $600.</p>
<p>While I can see the appeal, I have no intention of buying one.
Jan mentioned in the comments that he carries a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001EFSTI/?tag=georgvreill-20">Utili-Key 6-in-1 Multi-Tool</a>
on his key ring, and he's never had any problems with it at TSA check&shy;points.

    <p>I learned a really clever trick at our <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/09/14/KatrinaEvacueesWorkPartiesAndScalingBack.html">workparty</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p>We were using a dolly that we had borrowed from our neighbor Mary
to haul a heavy credenza up from the basement.
One of the tires was flat, which made the exercise even more difficult.</p>
<p>I got out my bicycle floor pump and started pumping,
but it was a waste of time.
The tire was tubeless and without any air,
so it just slipped loosely around the rim.
After a few minutes of futility,
Dale remembered something he had seen years before at a gas station.</p>
<p>He got a bowl of soapy water and a sponge,
and coated the metal <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/14/SoapingUpAFlatTire.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
