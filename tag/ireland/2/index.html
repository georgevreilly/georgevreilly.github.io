<p>Tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al Irish Christmas Pudding.</p>
<p>This recipe comes from my mother, who has used it for many years.
I added the soaking of the fruit in hot water.</p>
<p>This amount makes one large pudding and two smaller ones (4–5 quarts),
so scale down to your needs.</p>
<p>Stick a sprig of holly in the top before bringing to the dinner table.
When it's placed on the dinner table,
heat a tablespoon of brandy or whisky over a flame until it catches fire,
then pour over the pudding.
Turn down the lights to enjoy the blue-tinged flames.</p>
<p>Serve with <a class="reference external" href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/brandy-butter-hard-sauce/">Brandy Butter</a>.</p>

    <p>It's the 100th an&shy;niver&shy;sary of the 1911 census of the United Kingdom,
which was taken on the night of Sunday, April 2nd.
Ireland was still part of the UK and hence was included in the census.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, three twelve-year-olds went into
their local woods in Knocknaree near Dublin.
Hours later, only one was found, catatonic.
Now, under a different name, Rob Ryan is a detective in the Irish Murder Squad
and another twelve-year-old has been murdered in Knocknaree.</p>
<p>Tana French's debut is subtle and gripping.
The story unfolds in unexpected ways.
Ryan's re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship with his partner in detection, Cassie Maddox,
is tested to the breaking point
while he tries to conceal his past and stay on the case.</p>
<p>Highly rec&shy;om&shy;mend&shy;ed.</p>

<p>Patricia Teeling wants to experience more of life than farming and university,
and moves to Dublin to be a science teacher.
She quickly finds herself adrift,
belonging no more in her country home yet not of the city.
She is soon drawn to the married Englishman who lives downstairs.
His wife is murdered after she receives obscene telephone calls.
Then an attractive man with a limp—&shy;dubbed the Goose&shy;foot—ap&shy;pears.</p>
<p>While the author has an enviable command of English,
I found his characters to be tiresome and in&shy;scrutable yet un&shy;ac&shy;count&shy;ably eloquent.

<p>Nine years ago, the Ryan Commission was set up to produce
a report on physical, emotional, and sexual abuse of children
in Catholic Church–run re&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;to&shy;ries in Ireland.
This week, they released a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/europe/21ireland.html">2600-page report</a>
detailing abuse to tens of thousands of children from the 1930s to the 1990s.
The abuse and violence were systemic and in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ized, if not universal,
and they were hushed up and overlooked for decades.
The stories of the abused, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0523/1224247210382.html">in their own words</a>, make for horrifying reading.

<p>Séamus Joyce, a former senior civil servant,
returns to Dublin from self-imposed exile in Germany.
He has been engaged as a consultant by Finer Small Campuses
to evaluate his <em>alma mater</em>, King's College Dublin,
a third-rate, third-level in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion.</p>
<p>Millar, himself an Irish academic,
satirizes both Irish higher-level education and
the brave new world wrought by the Celtic Tiger economy.
It's a different world from the depressed, inward-looking Dublin
that Joyce moved to as a student.
The plot moves ef&shy;fi&shy;cient&shy;ly and some of the characters are, well, characters.
Not Joyce though: he's insecure and in&shy;tro&shy;vert&shy;ed,

<p>I grew up hating rugby.
I spent <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/02/19/OlympicsRazorthinMargins.html">eleven years</a> at a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary&#x27;s_College,_Dublin">rugger-bugger school</a> in Dublin.
I couldn't stand the game.
I was a small, unathletic child with no interest in sports.
Rugby, even the modified rugby that they teach seven-year-olds,
was violent and unpleasant and involved running around cold, wet fields.
I had a big operation on my feet when I was 10
and I parlayed that into an excuse never to play rugby again.</p>
<p>I can't remember when I last watched a rugby match,
but it was surely back in the '80s,
as I doubt I've seen one over the 20 years that I've been in the States.</p>

<p>On the 9th or 10th of January 1989, I flew from Dublin to New York.
That was the last day that I ever lived in Ireland.</p>
<p>I came to the U.S. on a tourist visa.
It was no lie.
I had a round-the-world ticket and I would go on to Australia in early March.
In June, I left Australia and traveled to Bangkok and Hong Kong.
Sometime in July, I landed back in Ireland to settle up my affairs.
I fit in a trip to the South of France with some old friends.</p>

<p>When I was a boy, anytime we said ‘Dundrum’ (a suburb of Dublin),
it was with a snigger, because it was synonymous in our minds
with the <a class="reference external" href="http://wikimapia.org/72462/Central-Mental-Hospital-Dundrum">mental asylum</a> located there.
Nowadays, Dundrum is much better known as the home of a large
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dundrum.ie/">shopping centre</a>.
I'm so out of touch with Dublin that I hadn't realized
that there was a major new shopping centre there.
I assumed that people were talking about the unim&shy;pres&shy;sive
little centre that I remembered there from my childhood.
Until today, when we went there to return the
mobile phone that we had given my mother for Christmas.</p>
<p>Dundrum was, indeed, a madhouse.
