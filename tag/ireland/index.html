<p>Before I begin to describe <em>The Heart's Invisible Furies</em>
with abundant spoilers, let me say two things.
Despite what I describe below, the book is very funny,
as Cyril recounts his frequent fuckups.
You would never know,
from reading the back cover or the excerpted reviews inside,
that Cyril is gay.
Yet Cyril's sexuality is the central theme of the book.
I can only assume that this is a marketing decision,
with which I strongly disagree.</p>

A Kindle All Star author by the name of Joanne Clancy

<p>There was supposed to be a second showing of <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/06/02/ReviewTheQueenOfIreland.html">The Queen of Ireland</a> doc­u­men­tary
this morning at the SIFF Uptown,
preceded by a panel discussion on Marriage Equality.
We attended the discussion,
which was moderated by Phil Grant, the Consul General of Ireland.
The three panelists were
Rory O'Neill, aka Panti Bliss, out of drag,
the accidental activist who became the face of marriage equality in Ireland;
Mayor Ed Murray, an Irish-American and Washington state's best-known gay politi­cian;
and Gary Gates, an LGBT de­mog­ra­ph­er, married to an Irishman,
who advised the Irish cam­paign­ers.</p>

<p>The indentured servitude that brought many Irish people to the Americas
could be very harsh, but it wasn't slavery.
Slavery was brutal and often murderous,
the children of slaves were themselves slaves,
and the aftermath continues to affect their de­scen­dants even now.</p>

<p>San Diego cop Benny Freedman decides to meet his Belfast relatives for the first time.
They disowned his Catholic mother decades ago when she married his Jewish father.
It turns out that her siblings are still un­re­pen­tant bigots,
but he finds himself drawn to two of his cousins,
pretty young Catherine Callahan
and Brendan O'Malley, a poet whose brother Sean has just been murdered.
Cousin Benny finds himself drawn into in­ternecine feuding between the IRA and the INLA,

<p>I visited a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.shawnodonnells.com/Seattle/">faux-Irish bar</a> this evening
where both three-leaved and four-leaved shamrocks were found in abundance.</p>
<p>The reason why <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock">shamrocks</a> are associated with Ireland
is that our patron saint, St. Patrick,
used the three-leaved plant
as a metaphor for the Divine Trinity,
the three gods in one,
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.
(The Irish usually refer to the Holy Spirit as the Holy Ghost.
I spent ages 7–18 at <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary%27s_College,_Dublin">St. Mary's College CSSp</a> in Dublin,
which is run by the Holy Ghost Fathers.)</p>
<p>A <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-leaf_clover">four-leaf clover</a> is considered lucky because it is rare.
It may be lucky but it is not a shamrock.</p>

<p>When I was growing up as a bisexual teenager in Dublin
in the late 1970s and early '80s—out to no-one but myself—it was hard to imagine a day like this.
Hardly anyone then had the fortitude to live openly as gay,
if they could pass for straight.
Queers and pansies and poofs were objects of derision and occasional violence.

<p>An Irish newspaper magnate has been found with his head blown off by a shotgun.
Quirke, the pathol­o­gist, looks into it and realizes that it's not suicide but murder.
As he digs deeper, he finds secrets that the wealthy elite of 1950s Dublin
do not want revealed, and he finds himself drawn to the dead man's French widow.</p>

Their early optimism that the war will be over by Christmas 1914 is soon crushed

<p>Danny Boyle is growing up in Dublin in the 1960s and 1970s,
watched over by his grand­moth­er.
First as she raises him, then from beyond the grave.
Danny, as his parents did before him, is making a mess of his life,
and he's a small-time drug dealer with some big problems.</p>
<p>I grew up in Dublin, about a decade behind Danny Boyle,
so I enjoyed Murphy's evocation of Dublin in the 1970s.
