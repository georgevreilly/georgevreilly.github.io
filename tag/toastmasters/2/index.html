<p>A Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters meeting has three parts:
prepared speeches, table topics, and eval&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tions of the prepared speeches.</p>
<p>Table Topics offer a chance for those present
to wing it on some topic for one or two minutes.
The Table Topics Master sets up the topics
and the speaker has as most a few minutes to prepare.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I'm running Table Topics,
I present a topic for everyone at the beginning of the section.
On a winter's day, I might ask people to tell us about
some favorite food they associate with winter.
Or I might ask them to tell us about where they're going for their summer vacation.</p>

<p>I've been to a few Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tions in the past.
Tonight was the first time that I helped out at one,
as one of the timers.
It was the combined Area 35 and 36 com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion.</p>
<p>A typical Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion has two parts,
a speech com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion and an evaluation com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion.
In the speech com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion, the com&shy;peti&shy;tors give a prepared speech
on a topic of their own choosing.
Some speech com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tions are humorous; tonight's wasn't.
In the evaluation com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion,
the invited speaker gives a speech heard by all the com&shy;peti&shy;tors.
They are taken out of the room,
then one at a time, they come back in and evaluate that speech.</p>
<p>The speech com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion is always <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/28/ToastmastersCompetition.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I'm the Secretary/Webmaster of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freelyspeaking.org/">Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters</a>,
a club whose membership is primarily LGBT, but is open to all.
We were chartered in September 1988.
I joined in 2004, after I left Microsoft and hence Microsoft Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters.</p>
<p>We're so proud of being 20 years old that we've celebrated twice!
We had a brunch for the current membership back in September,
and tonight we had a party for current, former, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews36_44/page39.cfm">would-be</a> members.</p>
<p>Not a huge turnout, but a lot of fun.
Many of us spoke about what had drawn us to FSTM and what set it apart from
other clubs for us.</p>

<p>I gave a speech at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.toastmasterspride.org/">Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters</a> this evening,
on Mind Mapping. You can see a shrunken version of the mind map for
the speech above. Clicking on it will lead to the full-sized image.</p>
<p>I created the mind map with <a class="reference external" href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/">Freemind</a>.
Here's the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/01/09/MindMappingSpeech.html/content/binary/MindMapSpeech.mm">speech mindmap</a> as a Freemind document.</p>
<p>I thought the speech went quite well.
It was speech #8, <a class="reference external" href="http://oklahomagalaxy.com/Toastmasters/manual.htm">working with visual aids</a>.
I drew a partial version of my speech's mind map on a white board ahead of time,
and drew a couple of mind maps on a flip chart during the speech.
The second one was a two-minute brain&shy;storm&shy;ing session
on increasing club membership.</p>

<p>SPOLIN GAMES</p>
<p>Spolin Games. That sounds like it could be a new set of titles for the
Xbox.</p>
<p>Far from it.</p>
<p>The Spolin Games are a set of improv theater games invented by Viola
Spolin in the nineteen-thirties, and refined by her for the next six
decades. These games are used in im&shy;pro&shy;vi&shy;sa&shy;tion&shy;al work, to help bring
out creativity and spon&shy;tane&shy;ity. Viola's son, Paul Sills, founded the
Second City improv theater company in Chicago back in the
nineteen-fifties.</p>

<p>I gave the following speech to Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters on June 25th, 2003, as Speech
#4, &quot;Show What You Mean&quot;. Clearly, I've reused some material from
<a class="reference external" href="/blog/2003/06/11/Bloomsday.html">my earlier post about Bloomsday</a>.
I'm also finding that I take longer to
deliver a speech to an audience than I do when rehearsing, so I cut some of
the material on the day to fit the seven-minute limit.</p>
<p>I've uploaded <a class="reference external" href="http://www.george-reilly.com/photos/Bloomsday-2003/">some photos of the reading</a>
to one of my other websites.</p>

<p>NAT&shy;U&shy;RAL&shy;IZA&shy;TION</p>
<p>Fellow Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters and Guests, last September, on the first
an&shy;niver&shy;sary of 9/11, I made one of the biggest decisions of my life: I
decided to apply for American cit&shy;i&shy;zen&shy;ship, to become nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;ized.</p>
<p>Like many of you, I am an immigrant. I have spent most of my adult life
in this country. Fourteen years ago, I came to the US from Ireland to
earn a Masters degree. I moved to Seattle in 1992, the same year that I
became a permanent resident. I <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/05/16/Naturalization.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>SLEEP APNEA</p>
<p>My wife is a cyborg.</p>
<p>That's not to say that she's the Terminator. Nor even that she's the
six-million dollar woman, although I do value her greatly. She calls
herself a cyborg because she sleeps with a breathing machine. At night,
she wears a mask over her nose to force air into her lungs.</p>
<p>When I first met her, she complained of being tired all the time, of
not getting a good night's sleep, of feeling stupid. When she drove <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/04/24/SleepApnea.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>
