<p>New Orleans and the rest of the Gulf is still a disaster area:

Disaster pre&shy;pared&shy;ness is far from where it should be.
The levee im&shy;prove&shy;ments are inadequate.
Re&shy;con&shy;struc&shy;tion is mired in bu&shy;reau&shy;cra&shy;cy and stalled in in&shy;com&shy;pe&shy;tence.
The money promised has not ma&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;al&shy;ized.
Only one-third of New Orleans residents have returned.</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has assisted George &amp; me in our attempt to
ready our home for hurricane evacuees.</p>
<p>Re&shy;gret&shy;tably, I have come to realize that I'm not emo&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly able to
make this commitment after all.  I thought I could open my home to
others, but I have sunk into a depression over the past few weeks that
has finally convinced me that I tried to bite off more than I could <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/10/16/DecisionAboutEvacueeHousing.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

    <p>The basement looks far better tonight than last night.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I removed all the lower panels along the entire front wall,
and filled in the cracks with concrete.
I also bought some in&shy;ex&shy;pen&shy;sive folding doors that will require some
framing.</p>
<p>Today, Chuck came over after the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.binetseattle.org/meeting.html#brunch">BiNet Brunch</a>
and helped me put back up the panels
and finish all the painting.
It looks intensely yellow.
The dark blue carpet will help tone it down.</p>
<p>After I've framed the doors,
the carpet can be layed.
I'm busy all next weekend,
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mountaineers.org/photography/workshop.html">Tim Grey's Photoshop Seminar</a>,
so I'll have to do it in the evenings.</p>
<p>I have not yet been able to order the window.

    <p>This afternoon I would have said that the basement was close to being finished.
The painting was almost done, the carpet was due to come in tomorrow,
and the window will arrive in two-to-three weeks.
But we've had a setback.</p>
<p>Since the last update, I have finished painting the spare bedroom.
Emma will move in there as soon as I finish writing this post.
She was waiting for the paint fumes to dissipate.</p>
<p>After Lowe's sent someone out to measure the new window hole,
I boarded it up with some plywood and 2x4s.</p>
<p>Dipankar came over Wednesday afternoon and helped me paint the
basement -- at least the parts that <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/30/ItNeverRainsButItPours.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>Work on the basement proceeds.</p>
<p>Our neighbor Leo helped me out with carpentry in the basement on Saturday.
Emma and Delf went to Oregon on Friday for the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flockandfiberfestival.com/">Flock and Fiber Festival</a>,
and didn't get back until Saturday night.
Leo and I stablized the framing around the furnace,
put up all the paneling,
routed the TV cables above the ceiling,
and replaced the missing ceiling tiles.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we planned to paint the spare bedroom and the basement.
It didn't work out as planned.
Just before lunch, Emma fell off a stepstool while
priming the walls of the spare bedroom, and hurt herself.
She spent six hours waiting in the Emergency Room

    <p>Last weekend, we made good progress on the basement.
On Saturday, Dale and Ernest helped us out, doing some demolition
in the basement, and bringing loads to Goodwill and to the dump
in their truck.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Jill and Delf helped us clean the remaining stuff
out of the basement. Louise excavated a hole outside the window
that we're going to enlarge. Deb, currently <em>hors de combat</em>
with a pinched nerve, dropped by to provide moral support,
as did Frank and Lyndol. Delf spent nearly twelve hours with us that day,
and thanks to his experience in con&shy;struc&shy;tion, he and I built
framing around the furnace.</p>
