<p>I have been cleaning up some issues with the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/04/22/Win64PortOfVim.html">Win64 port of Vim</a>,
including the <em>Edit with Vim</em> shell extension not working very well.
When I built the shell extension with VS 2005 on x86, I would
get the following whenever I right-clicked in Explorer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library</p>
<p>Runtime Error!</p>
<p>Program: C:WIN&shy;DOW&shy;S&shy;Ex&shy;plor&shy;er.EXE</p>
<p>R6034</p>
<p>An ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion has made an attempt to load the C runtime library in&shy;cor&shy;rect&shy;ly.
Please contact the ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion's support team for more in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was no mention of which ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion was at fault,
though it was obvious in this case.
I have also seen some mention of <tt class="docutils literal">verclsid</tt> in the error dialog,
though not when I took this snapshot.</p>

    <p>More than two years in the making, Vim-7.0 is finally
<a class="reference external" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vimannounce/message/161">out</a>!</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.vim.org/"></a>
<p>(Vim is Vi IMproved, an enormously enhanced version of the classic Unix
editor, <tt class="docutils literal">vi</tt>.)</p>
<p>The main features of the 7.0 release are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Spell checking</li>
<li>Omni-completion (In&shy;tel&shy;lisense-like)</li>
<li>Tabbed pages</li>
<li>VimL script language now supports Lists and Dic&shy;tio&shy;nar&shy;ies</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to take credit for some minor features of Vim 7:</p>

</ul>
<p>WikiPedia summarizes the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29#History">history of Vim</a>.
This enabled me to pinpoint when I first became a con&shy;trib&shy;u&shy;tor to Vim,
back in December 1995. I cleaned up the original, rather buggy
port of <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.editors/browse_thread/thread/a3fad9455d7a23cf/13c6939208787c22">Vim-3.0 to NT</a>,

<p>The only built-in means of editing a page in FlexWiki is to

There's no WYSIWYG feedback showing you whether you've got the wiki markup

<p>Back in December, Emma and I went to the Oregon coast for a week.
We had no Internet access and long dark evenings, so I spent quite a bit of
time on my laptop, working on a couple of projects. One was a new theme

    <p>I've ported Vim to Win64. Native binaries for AMD64 can be found on my
<a class="reference external" href="//www.georgevreilly.com/vim/">Vim page</a>.</p>
<p>In the end, it wasn't all that hard. Last weekend, I fixed ap&shy;prox&shy;i&shy;mate&shy;ly
400 warnings that were thrown up by the x86_amd64 cross compiler.
Most of them were due to the widening of <tt class="docutils literal">size_t</tt> (especially the value
returned from <tt class="docutils literal">strlen()</tt>) and <tt class="docutils literal">ptrdiff_t</tt> to 64-bits.
Several years ago, I went through a similar exercise in fixing these
warnings for Vim6, but I never finished the port.</p>
<p>This week, I scrounged access to an AMD64 box at work. Today, I turned on
the <a class="reference external" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yt4xw8fh(VS.80).aspx">/Wp64 flag</a>,
which found several new, subtler problems, where pointers where being

    <p>I've been trying to make <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vim.org/develop.php">Vim 7</a>
compile with the
<a class="reference external" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/">Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 Toolkit</a>,
as a favor to Bram Moolenaar, the primary author of Vim.
He wants to be able to use the free compiler as the
primary build tool for the Win32 version of Vim.</p>
<p>Oh. My. God.</p>
<p>The VC2003 toolkit may include a full optimizing compiler,
but it's certainly far from a complete system for building
Windows binaries.</p>
<p>First, I discovered that it came only with the C library headers,
but not the Windows headers. That was easily rectified. Download the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/">Platform SDK</a>.
Just the Windows Core SDK subset. This also got me nmake.</p>

<p>Why? Because I

Vi's keystrokes are bound into my

My fingers re&shy;flex&shy;ive&shy;ly use vi keystrokes to move around,
to delete text, to move blocks, to find patterns.
I don't have to think about using <tt class="docutils literal">dw</tt> to delete a word,
or <tt class="docutils literal">n</tt> to find the next match of a pattern,
or <tt class="docutils literal">yG</tt> to yank the rest of a file,

or <tt class="docutils literal">.</tt> to repeat the last mod&shy;i&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion.
My sub&shy;con&shy;cious does it for me.</p>
