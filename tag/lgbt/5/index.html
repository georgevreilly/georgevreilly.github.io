    <p>I was born 41 years ago today.
(Tech&shy;ni&shy;cal&shy;ly, yesterday, as it's now the early hours of March 16th.)
I was to have been called Vincent after my father,
but my mother's father, George Victor Clery,
had died just 12 days before.
I was baptised George Vincent Reilly on March 17th, St. Patrick's Day.</p>
<p>Beware the Ides of March, I tell people:
You might have to buy George a present.
Better a birthday present than the reception
that Julius Caesar received on
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_Of_March">March 15th, 44BC</a>.</p>
<p>I've never liked the name George all that much,
but I've never disliked it enough to do anything about it.

    <p>I <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/08/26/AIDSWalk2005.html">mentioned recently</a> that I would be walking in this year's AIDS Walk.
And so I did.</p>
<p>After months of dry, sunny weather in Seattle, I have grown un&shy;ac&shy;cus&shy;tomed to rain.
It was an unpleasant morning and an unpleasant shock.
The skies opened and I stood in an endless line waiting to register.
I raised $1180, which entitled me to huddle in the VIP tent, as the rain continued.
The rain finally let up about halfway along the route, as we debouched onto Broadway.</p>
<p>Thanks to my fellow Team BiNet Seattle fundrais&shy;ers, Emily and Meghan,
who raised a few hundred more between them.
Double thanks to Emily for giving <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/14/AIDSWalkRainHappens.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>On Saturday 10th September 2005, over 8,000 people will par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pate in
the Northwest AIDS Foundation Walk. I will be one of them, as I have
been every year since 1992.</p>

<p>George W. Bush, after months of hinting that he would support the Federal
Marriage Amendment, has endorsed it. He's desparate&shy;ly trying to change the
subject from whether he was AWOL from the National Guard in Alabama.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Campaign is urging everyone to oppose this. They provide a
sample letter to send to your rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives, but I threw it away and
wrote my own (below), which has been sent to my rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives, via the

I was very careful never to call myself &quot;gay&quot; because that label never fit
me. Even so, that must have been what many people heard, because only that
can explain their surprise when I told them a few years later that I had
fallen in love with Emma and was going to marry her.</p>
<p>Now many people believe I'm het&shy;ero&shy;sex&shy;u&shy;al, unless I take the trouble to
