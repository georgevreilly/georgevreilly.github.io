Twenty years ago, AIDS was a gay man's disease and a death sentence.

<p>I'm traveling in Europe at present
(Ireland last week, Italy this week and next),
so I have little op­por­tu­ni­ty to keep up with U.S. news,
but the Larry Craig case leapt out at me.
Craig is the second U.S. Senator
to be exposed in the last few months
as a major sexual hypocrite who espouses 'family values'
but can't keep his pecker in his pants.

<p>As I mentioned last month,
I par­tic­i­pat­ed in this year's AIDS Walk on Saturday.</p>
<p>I raised over <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lifelongevents.org/site/TR?px=1013411&amp;pg=personal&amp;fr_id=1080">$1300 online</a>,
handily exceeding my goal of $1,000.
I also raised another $300 in cash and checks at the fundrais­ing barbecue
that we threw on September 1st.</p>
<p>I've lost count, but I believe that in the last 15 years, I've raised about
$10,000 for charity. Most of it has been for the Northwest AIDS Walk.
The last few years that I was at Microsoft,
I raised $2,000-$3,000 each year, thanks to the power of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/citizenship/giving/programs/employee.asp">Microsoft matching</a>,
which doubled the amount of money that I raised.
I've also raised money two years running for

<p>Well, fuck! The Washington State Supreme Court handed down its long-awaited decision
today on the con­sti­tion­al­i­ty of the state's Defense of Marriage Act.
Somehow, they found that it didn't violate the state con­sti­tu­tion's Equal
Protection clause.</p>

Some anger, some dis­ap­point­ment. Mostly upbeat.
The young Latina couple were very affecting.
The Serkin-Pooles invited everyone to join their club,
