<p>Before I begin to describe <em>The Heart's Invisible Furies</em>
with abundant spoilers, let me say two things.
Despite what I describe below, the book is very funny,
as Cyril recounts his frequent fuckups.
You would never know,
from reading the back cover or the excerpted reviews inside,
that Cyril is gay.
Yet Cyril's sexuality is the central theme of the book.
I can only assume that this is a marketing decision,
with which I strongly disagree.</p>

    <p>I wrote this last night on Facebook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even 25 years after coming out as bisexual,
I still censor myself and still check myself about coming out yet again.
Even though Seattle is about as safe as it gets
and most people here are queer-friendly, it's reflexive.
And even in Seattle, queer bashings happen.
We came very close to an even bigger tragedy in a gay nightclub in Seattle
on New Year's Eve 2013,
when an arsonist lit a fire in Neighbours while 750 people were present.
The fire was promptly detected and put out,
no-one was injured, and the per&shy;pe&shy;tra&shy;tor is in prison.</p>

    <p>I spent the last 90 minutes reading Facebook,
and my feed has been absolutely over&shy;whelmed with Orlando-related posts,
be they grieving, discussing homophobia, calling for gun control,
or reacting to reactions.
I've never seen such a skewed set of posts.
Some of it is surely Facebook catering to what it knows are my interests,
but it seems like the vast majority of my friends
and the pages that I follow can talk of nothing else.
Even Trump/Clinton/Sanders articles, except as they pertain to this,
have tem&shy;porar&shy;i&shy;ly dis&shy;ap&shy;peared.</p>
<p>So far, I have seen nothing useful from Republican politi&shy;cians
regarding gun control or homophobia.</p>

    <p>I woke up this morning to news of another American massacre:
a lone gunman had murdered 50 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando,
and injured another 53 people.
It was the worst mass shooting in US history and also the worst hate crime.</p>
<p>I put it out of my head for the afternoon while I attended an old friend's wedding,
but it's been at the forefront of my mind ever since.</p>
<p>Only in America could we put up with massacre after massacre,

<p>There was supposed to be a second showing of <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/06/02/ReviewTheQueenOfIreland.html">The Queen of Ireland</a> doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary
this morning at the SIFF Uptown,
preceded by a panel discussion on Marriage Equality.
We attended the discussion,
which was moderated by Phil Grant, the Consul General of Ireland.
The three panelists were
Rory O'Neill, aka Panti Bliss, out of drag,
the accidental activist who became the face of marriage equality in Ireland;
Mayor Ed Murray, an Irish-American and Washington state's best-known gay politi&shy;cian;
and Gary Gates, an LGBT de&shy;mog&shy;ra&shy;ph&shy;er, married to an Irishman,
who advised the Irish cam&shy;paign&shy;ers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In an interview with MSNBC Friday,
2016 Democratic pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial candidate Hillary Clinton said
that Ronald and Nancy Reagan helped start a national con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion about HIV/AIDS.
This is not exactly a bald-faced lie,
but it is a gross mis&shy;un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing of history
and a mis&shy;rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion of the true gov&shy;ern&shy;men&shy;tal neglect
during the AIDS epidemic that killed millions worldwide.</p>

<p>As I wrote on Facebook earlier today:</p>

I'm really surprised by this.
I expected Hillary Clinton to know better.
It's one thing not to speak ill of the dead at their funeral.
It's quite another to make such a profoundly wrong assertion.

<a class="reference external" href="http://www.liberties.eu/en/news/irish-marriage-equality-referendum">Ireland's referendum on Marriage Equality</a>
looked set to pass with a strong majority.
Tears began running down my face as I read the reports
of con&shy;stituen&shy;cy after con&shy;stituen&shy;cy voted &quot;Yes&quot;.
I'm crying again as I write this.</p>
<p>When I was growing up as a bisexual teenager in Dublin
in the late 1970s and early '80s—out to no-one but myself—it was hard to imagine a day like this.
Hardly anyone then had the fortitude to live openly as gay,
if they could pass for straight.
Queers and pansies and poofs were objects of derision and occasional violence.

<p>This year is the 24th an&shy;niver&shy;sary of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattleaidswalk.org/">Seattle AIDS Walk</a>.
A whole generation has passed since the Northwest AIDS Walk began.
AIDS used to be the un&shy;stop&shy;pable disease that killed much of
a generation of gay men.</p>
<p>AIDS is still a serious problem, but the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of an&shy;ti&shy;retro&shy;vi&shy;ral
drugs in the Nineties means that people with HIV
are living longer, healthier lives than before.
More than 1.5 million Americans are now living with HIV/AIDS:
9,000 of them in King County.
40,000 people are infected every year,
and most new infections are among African-Americans.
The U.S. is getting off relatively lightly:
about one-quarter of the adults in southern Africa have HIV!</p>

<p>I'm fairly confident that Referendum&nbsp;71 will be approved.
It was leading by 51% this morning and by 51.8% this evening,
and leading 2:1 in King County, the most populous, most liberal county in Washington state.</p>
