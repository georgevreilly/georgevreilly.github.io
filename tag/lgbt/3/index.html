<p>The California Supreme Court handed down their decision about Propo­si­tion 8 today:
they're letting it stand.
No new gay marriages, though the 18,000 same-sex marriages
that were enacted last year remain valid.</p>
<p>It's a setback to be sure.
The silver lining is that the gay community has been fired up
since Propo­si­tion 8 passed in November.</p>
<p>There's a small but real danger that <a class="reference external" href="http://eqfed.org/campaign/DeclineToSignPet_71">Referendum 71</a>
will make it on to the ballot here in Washington state.
It would roll back the everything-but-marriage domestic part­ner­ship law
that passed recently.</p>

<p>A month ago, <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/04/08/VermontGayMarriageLegalized.html">Vermont and Iowa</a> passed gay marriage laws.
Today, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30602151/">Maine and New Hampshire</a> did the same.
The Maine Governor has already signed it into law.
The NH leg­is­la­ture passed a law, but it's possible their governor will veto it.</p>
<p>It's as if there were a pro-gay marriage backlash
after the anti-gay marriage <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2008/11/16/AgainstGayMarriageDontHaveOne.html">Propo­si­tion 8</a> passed in California last year.
Courts and leg­is­la­tures are realizing the fun­da­men­tal unfairness
of denying the benefits of marriage to all committed couples.
The sky didn't fall when Mass­a­chu­setts legalized gay marriage five years ago.</p>
<p>There's no immediate prospect of a gay marriage law being enacted in Washington State.

<p>On Friday, the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/04/04/IowaGayMarriageRuling.html">Iowa Supreme Court</a> struck down their state's
gay marriage ban.
Today, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20090407/NEWS03/90407016/1095/news03">Vermont Leg­is­la­ture</a> legalized gay marriage.</p>
<p>It's been a great week for fairness.
We still have a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20090407/NEWS03/90407022">long way to go</a>:
29 states have con­sti­tu­tion­al amendments banning gay marriage.</p>
<p>I'm sure the right wing are beating the fund-raising drums for all they're worth.
We can expect more Propo­si­tion 8-style backlashes, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>But the news still made my day.</p>

<p>I am greatly heartened by today's news of Iowa's Supreme Court
unan­i­mous­ly striking down the state's gay marriage ban.
The passage of <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2008/11/16/AgainstGayMarriageDontHaveOne.html">Propo­si­tion 8</a> in California was a setback.
The Iowa Court made a strong <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pamshouseblend.com/diary/10226/iowa-court-eviscerates-rightwing-talking-points">ruling</a>,
gutting the arguments against same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe now that in­ter­ra­cial marriage was illegal
in many states until 1967.
President Obama's parents could not have married in those states.
We look back at that now with bemusement and a little horror.
The opposition, then as now, was led by cultural con­ser­v­a­tives,
making <a class="reference external" href="http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2004_fall/forde.htm">religious arguments</a>.</p>
<p>Someday soon, we'll look back at the gay marriage debate
with the same bemusement and wonder what all the fuss <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/04/04/IowaGayMarriageRuling.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Emma, Eric, and I went to <a class="reference external" href="http://llaa.org/gaybingo">Gay Bingo</a> this evening.
It's a monthly fundraiser for the <a class="reference external" href="http://llaa.org/">Lifelong AIDS Alliance</a>.
This is not your grand­moth­er's church bingo:
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theabbey.org/">Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence</a> are the ushers
and the show is MC'd by a drag queen.</p>
<p>Every Gay Bingo has a theme.
Tonight's was the Love Boat, the campy 70's TV show.
Many in the audience dress for the occasion.
I wore the nearest thing to a lounge suit that I had;
Emma ac­ces­sorized a nautical top with a scarf.
We brought Jill and Dick the last time we went.

<p>Milk was a middle-aged closet case who moved to San Francisco in the early 1970s,
became po­lit­i­cal­ly active, and started running for office,
un­suc­cess­ful­ly at first.
“The Mayor of Castro Street” was elected to the San Francisco Board of
Su­per­vi­sors in 1977,
the first openly gay man to hold public office in the United States.
A year later, only days after the anti-gay Cal­i­forn­ian ballot initiative,
Propo­si­tion 6, went down to defeat,
Milk and Mayor George Moscone were murdered by ex-Supervisor Dan White.</p>

Seattle Protest March against Propo­si­tion 8
</div><p>I mentioned the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2008/11/13/NationalProtestAgainstProp8.html">other day</a> there were to be protest marches
all over the country today against Propo­si­tion 8,
the anti-gay marriage amendment that passed last week in California.</p>
<p>Thousands marched in Seattle, from Volunteer Park to Westlake Center.
The P-I and the Seattle Times say 3,000.
<a class="reference external" href="http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2008/11/15/the_seattle_masses">The Stranger</a> says 6,000.
I was one of them. It was a lot.
Westlake was jammed.</p>
<p>The crowd was in good spirits.
Pissed off at the votes in California, Florida, Arizona, and Arkansas,
but determined to keep on fighting.

<p>There was only sour note to the huge victories in Tuesday's elections:
the passage of Propo­si­tion 8, the anti-gay marriage amendment in California.
A deceitful campaign preyed on voters' fears and homophobia.
The No on 8 campaign was massively outspent and not very effective.</p>
<p>I'm convinced that marriage equality will come, but this is a setback.
Gay couples, who only gained the right to marry earlier this year in
California, have lost that right.</p>
<p>The Mormon Church was the prime mover behind the Yes on 8 campaign,
donating $19 million, nearly 80% of the total raised.
A backlash is brewing.
