<p>I got myself a <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/03/16/OfBagsBugattisAndBirthdays.html">R.E.Load bag</a> for my birthday.
My previous bag, a so-called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/300/TB0203">Large Cafe bag</a> from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tombihn.com/">Tom Bihn</a>,
wasn't large enough to ac&shy;com&shy;mo&shy;date a 17&quot; MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>The R.E.Load bag turned out to be less than ideal.
It is, if anything, too big, and it lacks dividers and smaller pockets.
My laptop and other stuff was swimming around inside it.
It's a messenger bag aimed at <em>real</em> bike messengers,
not laptop-toting nerds.</p>
<p>Last weekend, I went down to Tom Bihn's showroom again
and picked up a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/300/TB0825">Super Ego bag</a>, like the one pictured here.
This bag is designed to tote laptops, and it's working out a lot better.</p>

<p>10/29. In mid-October, I shaved off the goatee that I had sported since March,
leaving me clean-shaven for the first time in a decade.
I quickly got over that urge and let the beard start growing back.</p>
<p>This is me at the two-week stage: a self-portrait taken while
ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ment&shy;ing with the new camera. It looks a little odd to me.
I'm using this as the startup photo on the camera.</p>

<p>I noted at the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/07/01/MichellesWedding.html">beginning of July</a>
that my sister Michelle was to be married to David Bowles
in Dublin in early November.</p>
<p>The wedding took place on Friday, November 10th. Emma and I arrived the
afternoon before, half stumbling with tiredness.
My brother, Mark, and his wife, Lizzy, had arrived
from New York only hours earlier.</p>
<p>The ceremony took place at 1pm at St. Brigid's,
a small, old Anglican church, on the outskirts of Stillorgan village,
long since absorbed into the Dublin met&shy;ro&shy;pol&shy;i&shy;tan area.
It was very <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Ascendancy">Ascendancy</a>, with 19th century plaques about

<p>As I mentioned last month,
I par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pat&shy;ed in this year's AIDS Walk on Saturday.</p>
<p>I raised over <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lifelongevents.org/site/TR?px=1013411&amp;pg=personal&amp;fr_id=1080">$1300 online</a>,
handily exceeding my goal of $1,000.
I also raised another $300 in cash and checks at the fundrais&shy;ing barbecue
that we threw on September 1st.</p>
<p>I've lost count, but I believe that in the last 15 years, I've raised about
$10,000 for charity. Most of it has been for the Northwest AIDS Walk.
The last few years that I was at Microsoft,
I raised $2,000-$3,000 each year, thanks to the power of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/citizenship/giving/programs/employee.asp">Microsoft matching</a>,
which doubled the amount of money that I raised.
I've also raised money two years running for

<p>In mid-July, most of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.WorkForAtlas.com">Atlas Solutions</a>
developer teams moved from
our old offices at Fifth and Jackson in the In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al District
four blocks west to swanky offices in Pioneer Square.
The new offices are at the State building on the corner of
Occidental and Main, the pedes&shy;tri&shy;an&shy;ized block
with the antique stores and art galleries.
Occidental Park across the street has been re&shy;fur&shy;bished.
There are three coffee shops within two blocks,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/">Elliott Bay Books</a>
is one block west of us.
It's all very pleasant, with the exception of the large
number of homeless people.</p>

    <p>My brother David sent me this photo earlier today, of
me, him, and Michelle. I'm guessing that Michelle is less than a year old,
so it was taken sometime in 1971, which would make David four and me six.
(Our youngest brother, Mark, wasn't born until 1973.)</p>

<p>Emma thinks we're adorable and has already made this picture her desktop
background on her work computer.</p>
<p>Mark has another photo of the four of us, taken in 1978

Emma and I had been given a bottle of <em>Dom Perignon '92</em> for our wedding
that we had never quite found a suitable occasion for until now,

<p>I hadn't really planned to visit Ireland this year, but then my sister
Michelle phoned the other day to say that her boyfriend, David Bowles, had
just proposed to her. Not a big surprise. They had moved in together
earlier this year, and we were all assuming that it was a question of when,
not if.</p>
<p>They plan to get married quite soon, as his father has been given
six-to-nine months to live, and they want him to be at the wedding. I don't
know if the date is firm yet, but the latest that I'm hearing is November-11th.</p>
