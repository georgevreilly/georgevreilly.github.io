<p>10/29. In mid-October, I shaved off the goatee that I had sported since March,
leaving me clean-shaven for the first time in a decade.
I quickly got over that urge and let the beard start growing back.</p>
<p>This is me at the two-week stage: a self-portrait taken while
ex­per­i­ment­ing with the new camera. It looks a little odd to me.
I'm using this as the startup photo on the camera.</p>

<p>I noted at the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/07/01/MichellesWedding.html">beginning of July</a>
that my sister Michelle was to be married to David Bowles
in Dublin in early November.</p>
<p>The wedding took place on Friday, November 10th. Emma and I arrived the
afternoon before, half stumbling with tiredness.
My brother, Mark, and his wife, Lizzy, had arrived
from New York only hours earlier.</p>
<p>The ceremony took place at 1pm at St. Brigid's,
a small, old Anglican church, on the outskirts of Stillorgan village,
long since absorbed into the Dublin met­ro­pol­i­tan area.
It was very <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Ascendancy">Ascendancy</a>, with 19th century plaques about

<p>As I mentioned last month,
I par­tic­i­pat­ed in this year's AIDS Walk on Saturday.</p>
<p>I raised over <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lifelongevents.org/site/TR?px=1013411&amp;pg=personal&amp;fr_id=1080">$1300 online</a>,
handily exceeding my goal of $1,000.
I also raised another $300 in cash and checks at the fundrais­ing barbecue
that we threw on September 1st.</p>
<p>I've lost count, but I believe that in the last 15 years, I've raised about
$10,000 for charity. Most of it has been for the Northwest AIDS Walk.
The last few years that I was at Microsoft,
I raised $2,000-$3,000 each year, thanks to the power of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/citizenship/giving/programs/employee.asp">Microsoft matching</a>,
which doubled the amount of money that I raised.
I've also raised money two years running for

<p>In mid-July, most of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.WorkForAtlas.com">Atlas Solutions</a>
developer teams moved from
our old offices at Fifth and Jackson in the In­ter­na­tion­al District
four blocks west to swanky offices in Pioneer Square.
The new offices are at the State building on the corner of
Occidental and Main, the pedes­tri­an­ized block
with the antique stores and art galleries.
Occidental Park across the street has been re­fur­bished.
There are three coffee shops within two blocks,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/">Elliott Bay Books</a>
is one block west of us.
It's all very pleasant, with the exception of the large
number of homeless people.</p>

    <p>My brother David sent me this photo earlier today, of
me, him, and Michelle. I'm guessing that Michelle is less than a year old,
so it was taken sometime in 1971, which would make David four and me six.
(Our youngest brother, Mark, wasn't born until 1973.)</p>

<p>Emma thinks we're adorable and has already made this picture her desktop
background on her work computer.</p>
<p>Mark has another photo of the four of us, taken in 1978

Emma and I had been given a bottle of <em>Dom Perignon '92</em> for our wedding
that we had never quite found a suitable occasion for until now,
so we chilled that in an­tic­i­pa­tion of tonight's cel­e­bra­tion.

<p>I hadn't really planned to visit Ireland this year, but then my sister
Michelle phoned the other day to say that her boyfriend, David Bowles, had
just proposed to her. Not a big surprise. They had moved in together
earlier this year, and we were all assuming that it was a question of when,
not if.</p>
<p>They plan to get married quite soon, as his father has been given
six-to-nine months to live, and they want him to be at the wedding. I don't
know if the date is firm yet, but the latest that I'm hearing is November-11th.</p>

<p>I've been sporting a goatee for the last two months, instead of my usual
full beard. This has ne­ces­si­tat­ed shaving, and I've been using those
disposable Bic razors. I haven't been very happy with them. They left my
face feeling like I had been making out with a cheese grater.</p>
<p>I bought one of those new five-bladed <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gillettefusion.com/us/">Fusion razors</a> yesterday and shaved with it this
morning. Oh my! Very smooth!</p>
<p>I'm convinced that five blades is marketing hokum and that five blades is
probably not really better than four blades. Or three blades. But five
blades is certainly better than one.</p>
