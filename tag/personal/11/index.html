<p>Last night, I un&shy;wit&shy;ting&shy;ly bought some habenero peppers when I was shopping
for in&shy;gre&shy;di&shy;ents for <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/04/19/BarbecueUniversity.html">Afghan Chicken</a>.
They tasted hot, but not too hot, when I nibbled a couple of small pieces.
I cut them up with my bare hands.
By the time that I was finished, my fingers felt as if they had been burned!
As if I had burned them with steam or something.
It took several hours for the pain to go away.
For&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, I didn't rub my eyes or more delicate mucous membranes,
while I still had the habenero oils on my skin.</p>
<p>The chicken itself was fine: not too spicy.
The cooked-up onion marinade had <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2007/08/05/HabenerosHurt.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I worked at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/">Atlas Solutions</a>, a subsidiary of aQuantive, from October 2005
to July 2007.</p>
<p>Google bought our largest competitor, Dou&shy;bleClick, for $3 Billion
in April 2007.
In the following five weeks, all the other major web ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ing companies
were bought up,
cul&shy;mi&shy;nat&shy;ing in Microsoft paying the stupendous sum of $6.3 billion for aQuantive.
The Microsoft-aQuantive deal closes in mid-August.</p>
<p>To put it mildly, I was not excited at the thought of becoming
a Microsoft employee yet again.
Cu&shy;mu&shy;la&shy;tive&shy;ly, between 1992 and 2005, I spent 10 years at Microsoft
as an employee or contractor,
including a year and a half on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_%28operating_system%29">Cairo</a>,

<p>I got myself a <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/03/16/OfBagsBugattisAndBirthdays.html">R.E.Load bag</a> for my birthday.
My previous bag, a so-called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/300/TB0203">Large Cafe bag</a> from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tombihn.com/">Tom Bihn</a>,
wasn't large enough to ac&shy;com&shy;mo&shy;date a 17&quot; MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>The R.E.Load bag turned out to be less than ideal.
It is, if anything, too big, and it lacks dividers and smaller pockets.
My laptop and other stuff was swimming around inside it.
It's a messenger bag aimed at <em>real</em> bike messengers,
not laptop-toting nerds.</p>
<p>Last weekend, I went down to Tom Bihn's showroom again
and picked up a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/300/TB0825">Super Ego bag</a>, like the one pictured here.
This bag is designed to tote laptops, and it's working out a lot better.</p>

<p>10/29. In mid-October, I shaved off the goatee that I had sported since March,
leaving me clean-shaven for the first time in a decade.
I quickly got over that urge and let the beard start growing back.</p>
<p>This is me at the two-week stage: a self-portrait taken while
ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ment&shy;ing with the new camera. It looks a little odd to me.
I'm using this as the startup photo on the camera.</p>

that my sister Michelle was to be married to David Bowles
in Dublin in early November.</p>
<p>The wedding took place on Friday, November 10th. Emma and I arrived the
afternoon before, half stumbling with tiredness.
My brother, Mark, and his wife, Lizzy, had arrived
from New York only hours earlier.</p>
<p>The ceremony took place at 1pm at St. Brigid's,
a small, old Anglican church, on the outskirts of Stillorgan village,
long since absorbed into the Dublin met&shy;ro&shy;pol&shy;i&shy;tan area.

<p>As I mentioned last month,
I par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pat&shy;ed in this year's AIDS Walk on Saturday.</p>
<p>I raised over <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lifelongevents.org/site/TR?px=1013411&amp;pg=personal&amp;fr_id=1080">$1300 online</a>,
handily exceeding my goal of $1,000.
I also raised another $300 in cash and checks at the fundrais&shy;ing barbecue
that we threw on September 1st.</p>
<p>I've lost count, but I believe that in the last 15 years, I've raised about
$10,000 for charity. Most of it has been for the Northwest AIDS Walk.
The last few years that I was at Microsoft,
I raised $2,000-$3,000 each year, thanks to the power of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/citizenship/giving/programs/employee.asp">Microsoft matching</a>,
which doubled the amount of money that I raised.
I've also raised money two years running for

developer teams moved from
our old offices at Fifth and Jackson in the In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al District
four blocks west to swanky offices in Pioneer Square.
The new offices are at the State building on the corner of
Occidental and Main, the pedes&shy;tri&shy;an&shy;ized block
with the antique stores and art galleries.
Occidental Park across the street has been re&shy;fur&shy;bished.
There are three coffee shops within two blocks,

is one block west of us.
It's all very pleasant, with the exception of the large

<p>This year is the 20th an&shy;niver&shy;sary of the Northwest AIDS Walk.
A whole generation has passed.
Twenty years ago, AIDS was considered a gay man's disease and a death sentence.
The U.S. government was just beginning to ac&shy;knowl&shy;edge the existence of AIDS,
half a decade after it had first been recognized by health au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ties,
and thousands had died.</p>
<p>AIDS is still a serious problem,
but the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of an&shy;ti&shy;retro&shy;vi&shy;ral drugs a decade ago
means that people with HIV are living longer,
healthier lives than before.
More than 1 million Americans are now living with HIV/AIDS:
9,000 of them in King County.
40,000 people are infected every year in the U.S.,

    <p>My brother David sent me this photo earlier today, of
me, him, and Michelle. I'm guessing that Michelle is less than a year old,
so it was taken sometime in 1971, which would make David four and me six.
(Our youngest brother, Mark, wasn't born until 1973.)</p>

<p>Emma thinks we're adorable and has already made this picture her desktop
background on her work computer.</p>
<p>Mark has another photo of the four of us, taken in 1978
