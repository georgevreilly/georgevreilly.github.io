<p>Perhaps the most ir&shy;refutable sign of middle age for me
was getting <a class="reference external" href="http://www.allaboutvision.com/over40/progressive.htm">pro&shy;gres&shy;sive lenses</a> six months ago.</p>
<p>I had noticed for several months that I was having a little difficulty with smaller print,
and a visit to the op&shy;tometrist confirmed that I needed reading glasses.
Now I'm near-sighted and far-sighted, all at the same time.</p>
<p>The new glasses took some getting used to.
I had been accustomed to looking through any part of the lens.
Now I had to tilt my head downwards rather than simply turn my eyes down,
if I wanted to look at the floor,
or I'd be looking through the short-distance reading portion.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.motss/browse_thread/thread/473f39ddc893391e#">soc.motss</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.movies.past-films/browse_thread/thread/a95e8d889321afc4#">rec.arts.movies.past-films</a>.</p>

<p>Frank Maloney was a longtime regular in this newsgroup.
After a long illness, he died on January 6th, 2009 at his home.</p>
<p>Some of Frank's friends are helping Lyndol,
his partner of more than 30 years,
to put together a memorial for Frank.
It'll be held near Seattle on the afternoon of July 5th.</p>
<p>Frank was a published poet and we'll be reading some of his poems.
But he also spent more than 20 years par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pat&shy;ing in newsgroups,
posted thousands of articles, and made many online friends.
It seems fitting for us to read some of his voluminous output.</p>

<p>Other people must think I'm a grown up or something.
I've been invited to a couple of dinner auctions in the last year.
We were invited to one for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.choral-arts.org/">Choral Arts</a> tonight
by one of the primary organizers.
Emma was feeling unwell, so I went by myself.</p>
<p>I flat out made a donation and bought some raffle tickets.
I also won two modest items in the auction,
tickets for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.artswest.org/">Arts West</a> and five voice lessons.</p>
<p>I have little natural aptitude for music.
I found it difficult to keep time on a triangle
in the class “orches&shy;tra” when I was a kid.
Songs and music don't stick in my head.

<p>I initially learned to drive on the left in Ireland,
but have spent the last 20 years driving on the right in the States.
I personally never had any difficulty switching from one side to the oth&shy;er—ex&shy;cept when extremely jet&shy;lagged—but I know several people who find it enormously stressful.
I find it easy enough to orient myself so that the lane divider is at the correct position.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, my father often brought his Irish car
over to mainland Europe on the car ferries.
A right-hand drive car driving on the right is doubly tricky.
It didn't seem to bother him too much, but <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/05/21/DrivingOnTheOtherSideOfTheRoad.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Emma turned 50 today.
She was a mere (late) thirty-something when I met her.</p>
<p>We had dinner at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-georgian-seattle">The Georgian</a> in the classic Fairmont Olympic hotel.
Until a few years ago, it was the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairmont_Olympic_Hotel_(Seattle)">Four Seasons</a>.
The Georgian is in an old-fashioned dining room with soaring ceilings
that mutes the con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion.
The waiters were attentive and made us feel welcome.</p>
<p>The food is not out&shy;ra&shy;geous&shy;ly ex&shy;pen&shy;sive—we both chose to have the <em>prix fixe</em> dinner at $49.
I had the wine for an additional $20.
The pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion was superb and we both enjoyed the food.
An asparagus salad, followed by chicken wrapped in apple-smoked bacon,
and the black-and-white soufflé.

<p>I gave a poetry reading tonight, of <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/07/FrankRAJMaloney19452009.html">Frank Maloney</a>'s poems.
I'm working through a book of In&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;tive Reading projects
at Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters.
I had to read some poetry for tonight's project
and Frank's work was an obvious choice.
(Had I remembered, I would have recorded the reading and made a podcast.)</p>
<p>Frank was most active as a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Richard_Maloney_(poet)">poet</a> in the 1970s when he published
his collection, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Eat-Slug-Frank-Maloney/dp/0914742140/">How to Eat a Slug</a>.</p>
<p>Six poems follow that give a taste of his work.
The material in [square brackets] I omitted from the reading.</p>

<p>I fear going into my home office.
It's a huge mess of clutter,
books piled everywhere, boxes of unsorted papers,
crap all over my desk.
(No, it's not as bad as the ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;ny&shy;ing photo.)</p>
<p>My office overwhelms me.
As a result, I don't go in there,
except to drop more stuff off and make it worse.
I rarely use the desktop system there.</p>
<p>The living room couch has become my sub-office.
I sit there of an evening and surf the web from my laptop.
I pull out the bills every couple of weeks
and take care of them from the couch.
Then I dump them in the office.</p>
<p>I know what the solution is.

<p>In Seattle, it is said that moss grows on the north side of the rain.
To be sure, moss thrives in the shadier parts of our yard.</p>
<p>On a cold, dry February day,
I rented a pressure washer with the intention
of scouring the moss from the ground
and the flaking paint from the garage walls.
Although it was quite effective at removing moss,
it made a godawful mess.
There were muddy flecks of moss everywhere.
Against the flaking paint, it made little impression
and I still have to deal with that.
I had dealt with perhaps a third of the moss
when the pressure washer died.
I got a partial refund, but <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/04/06/RemovingMoss.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>It's been a long, dreary winter in Seattle.
After a horrible, wet Saturday,
last Sunday was glorious, the first nice day in weeks.
Then the cold and rain came back.
It snowed on April 1st, for Pete's sake.</p>
<p>And now we have another lovely weekend,
with promised highs in the high Sixties tomorrow.
I did some yard work today
and cleaned the grill and outdoor furniture.
We've invited a handful of friends over for dinner tomorrow night.</p>
