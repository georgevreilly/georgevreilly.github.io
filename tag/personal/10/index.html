<p>Perusing Eric S. Raymond's blog recently,
I noticed his <a class="reference external" href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=578">claim</a> that as a one-time maintainer of GIFLIB,
just about <em>every</em> cellphone and browser has some of his software
running in it.</p>
<p>That got me thinking about my own reach and
where software that I've con&shy;tributed to can be found.</p>

<p>I spent seven years on the IIS (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services">Internet In&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion Services</a>)
de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment team at Microsoft.
By any measure, that's a successful product,
running one-third of all websites.
There are over 100 million registered websites.
Many of them are parked and many others see negligible volume,
but that's millions, perhaps tens <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/11/29/Reach.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Emma and I moved in together in August 1998,
and promptly started a tradition that we've maintained ever since:
Games Night.
On the second and fourth Thursday evening of every month,
we invite our friends over to play board games.</p>
<p>For us, it's a low-effort way to stay in touch with our friends,
and for our friends to see each other.
Some people are regulars and make it almost every time.
Others we see once or twice a year at Games Night, if that.
Games are the excuse,
but many people come by to chat.</p>
<p>We provide a space and a pre&shy;dictable time.
We have drinks on hand and often a snack.

I also raised another $115 in cash and checks at the fundrais&shy;ing barbecue

<p>This year is the 22nd an&shy;niver&shy;sary of the Northwest AIDS Walk.
A whole generation has passed.
Twenty years ago, AIDS was a gay man's disease and a death sentence.
The Reagan ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion was just beginning to
ac&shy;knowl&shy;edge the existence of AIDS,
half a decade after it had first been recognized and
thousands had died.</p>
<p>AIDS is still a serious problem, but the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of an&shy;ti&shy;retro&shy;vi&shy;ral
drugs a decade ago means that people with HIV
are living longer, healthier lives than before.
More than 1.5 million Americans are now living with HIV/AIDS:
9,000 of them in King County.
40,000 people are infected every year,
and most new infections are among African-Americans.
The U.S. is getting <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/09/22/AIDSWalk2008.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly defended his doctoral dis&shy;ser&shy;ta&shy;tion on Tuesday

<p>He studied part-time at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.egs.edu/">European Graduate School</a>
in New York City, while juggling several jobs.
His doctorate is in Media and Com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tions

which he picked <em>before</em> 9/11.</p>
<p>He is only the second PhD in the family.

<p>Last night, I un&shy;wit&shy;ting&shy;ly bought some habenero peppers when I was shopping
for in&shy;gre&shy;di&shy;ents for <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/04/19/BarbecueUniversity.html">Afghan Chicken</a>.
They tasted hot, but not too hot, when I nibbled a couple of small pieces.
I cut them up with my bare hands.
By the time that I was finished, my fingers felt as if they had been burned!
As if I had burned them with steam or something.
It took several hours for the pain to go away.
For&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, I didn't rub my eyes or more delicate mucous membranes,
while I still had the habenero oils on my skin.</p>
<p>The chicken itself was fine: not too spicy.
The cooked-up onion marinade had <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2007/08/05/HabenerosHurt.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I worked at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/">Atlas Solutions</a>, a subsidiary of aQuantive, from October 2005
to July 2007.</p>
<p>Google bought our largest competitor, Dou&shy;bleClick, for $3 Billion
in April 2007.
In the following five weeks, all the other major web ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ing companies
were bought up,
cul&shy;mi&shy;nat&shy;ing in Microsoft paying the stupendous sum of $6 billion for aQuantive.
The Microsoft-aQuantive deal closes in mid-August.</p>
<p>To put it mildly, I was not excited at the thought of becoming
a Microsoft employee yet again.
Cu&shy;mu&shy;la&shy;tive&shy;ly, between 1992 and 2005, I spent 10 years at Microsoft
as an employee or contractor,
including a year and a half on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_%28operating_system%29">Cairo</a>,
