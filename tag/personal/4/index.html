<p>I've oc­ca­sion­al­ly had little blisters
appear on my fingers and palms in hot weather in the past.
These vesicles are filled with clear liquid, annoying and a little bit sore,
and they sting when my hands are soaked in water.</p>
<p>In August, they came back and they were larger and more swollen than ever before.
My doctor diagnosed a case of dyshidrot­ic eczema
and prescribed <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobetasol_propionate">clobetasol propionate</a> ointment.

<p>My mother's mother's sister, known to all of us as Auntie Pat,
was born on January 2nd, 1915, in London.
My mother and a few other family members will join her today for her 100th birthday party.
I understand that the Queen has been notified
and will be sending a telegram of con­grat­u­la­tions,
but can't attend in person.</p>
<p>Pat is frail but her mind is still good,
and she continues to live by herself in her own home in Bournemouth, England.
In the last decade, Pat has <em>twice</em> emigrated to New Zealand,
but it didn't work out either time.</p>
<p>Pat married only once, in her sixties,
to a Polish émigré who <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2015/01/02/GreatAuntPatAt100.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>In most of the world, as I write this, it's already 2015.
We in Seattle will enter the New Year in 4½ hours.</p>
<p>For me personally, it was a reasonably good year.
My health remained good,
I had a new <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2013/12/17/JoiningCookbrite.html">job</a>,
we had a good summer vacation,
and generally enjoyed ourselves.
Emma's health was not so great,
but she's set up an <a class="reference external" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/emmasimonesworkshop">Etsy shop for her knitting</a>
and started modeling for artists.</p>
<p>I look forward to 2015.</p>

<p>30 years ago today, I sat down at a computer for the first time,
and I wrote my first program.</p>
<p>I was in Fifth Year of secondary school in Ire­land—the equivalent of eleventh grade.
Personal computers were just coming into Ireland;
few people had them.
I had been taking an ex­tracur­ric­u­lar course in computer pro­gram­ming,
in the school's physics lab.
We wrote code on paper at our desks, as there were no computers in the room.
Somehow, I hadn't realized that there was another room with computers,
in a normally off-limits part of the school, until late January.</p>
<p>Once I sat down at a computer, I was hooked.

    <p>It's the 100th an­niver­sary of the 1911 census of the United Kingdom,
which was taken on the night of Sunday, April 2nd.
Ireland was still part of the UK and hence was included in the census.</p>
<p>The census results are online.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_of_Ireland,_1911">Irish results</a> are freely browsable.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.1911census.co.uk/">UK results</a> cost money.</p>

<p>My maternal grand­fa­ther, George Victor Clery, was born on March 30th, 1900.

<p>This year is the 24th an­niver­sary of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattleaidswalk.org/">Seattle AIDS Walk</a>.
A whole generation has passed since the Northwest AIDS Walk began.
AIDS used to be the un­stop­pable disease that killed much of
a generation of gay men.</p>
<p>AIDS is still a serious problem, but the de­vel­op­ment of an­ti­retro­vi­ral
drugs in the Nineties means that people with HIV
are living longer, healthier lives than before.
More than 1.5 million Americans are now living with HIV/AIDS:
9,000 of them in King County.
40,000 people are infected every year,
and most new infections are among African-Americans.
The U.S. is getting off relatively lightly:
about one-quarter of the adults in southern Africa have HIV!</p>

<p>Twelve years ago today, Emma and I met face-to-face for the first time.
We had been talking on the phone for about three weeks
after I had answered her personals ad in <em>The Stranger</em>.
We might have met a little sooner,
but she was busy meeting the other guys who had responded,
and I was undergoing the IIS 4 deathmarch at Microsoft.</p>
<p>We were both nervous and we each responded char­ac­ter­is­ti­cal­ly.
Emma babbled; I said very little.
She told me later that she thought that she had scared me off.
She hadn't, though.
We had already talked several times on the phone and she had been less nervous.
I liked her and <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/11/07/12thAnniversary.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Two months after our <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/07/06/FranksMemorial.html">memorial</a> for Frank Maloney,
we took the ferry over to Vashon Island to scatter his ashes.
It was a beautiful September day, sunny but not too hot,
and a 20-minute ferry ride was most pleasant.</p>
<p>Kim and Holly fed us lunch at their place
and we all fell in love with their six rescue kittens.
We drove to a secluded beach
and each of us scattered a teaspoon of Frank's ashes upon the waters.
We sat there for a while and talked and wandered.
Then, back to Holly and Kim's for cake and coffee.</p>
<p>I know that Frank would have thoroughly enjoyed the day:

<p>Paying bills always makes me grumpy.
More than just the drain on my wallet,
it's also the sheer hassle and tedium.</p>
<p>I think it was last year that I finally switched over to using electronic billpay.
(I'm not always an early adopter.)
The hassle is less and I seldom write checks now.</p>
<p>I'd like to know why electronic payments take days, not mil­lisec­onds, to clear.
More predatory bank practices, no doubt.</p>
<p>I wrote several checks tonight.
For months I had been putting off renewing my membership
in various do-gooder or­ga­ni­za­tions like the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a>, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.glaad.org/">GLAAD</a>.

Actually, the weather was so wet this morning that we cooked and ate inside.</p>
<p>I am happy to report that thanks to the generosity of my sponsors,
I have raised $982 of my original goal of $1000.
With three weeks left until the walk,
I am predicting success in reaching my goal.</p>
