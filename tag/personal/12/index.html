    <p>In May, I pounded out a record 31 blog posts. June draws to a close and
this is only my third post.</p>
<p>In brief, here's some of the highlights of June.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2006.html"></a>
<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2006.html">read the Cyclops chapter of Ulysses</a> on June 16th.
I read a part and I was also the script wrangler and webmaster.</p>
<p>My profile on my Windows XP laptop got corrupted. I decided that I would
make flatten it and turn it into a dual-boot system. I'm now on my third
week of running Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake). Quite easy to get going. Not so

<p>I've been sporting a goatee for the last two months, instead of my usual
full beard. This has ne­ces­si­tat­ed shaving, and I've been using those
disposable Bic razors. I haven't been very happy with them. They left my
face feeling like I had been making out with a cheese grater.</p>
<p>I bought one of those new five-bladed <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gillettefusion.com/us/">Fusion razors</a> yesterday and shaved with it this
morning. Oh my! Very smooth!</p>
<p>I'm convinced that five blades is marketing hokum and that five blades is
probably not really better than four blades. Or three blades. But five
blades is certainly better than one.</p>

    <p>Today (May 6th) was our sixth wedding an­niver­sary.
In some ways, it feels like only yesterday.
In others, it feels like we've been together forever.</p>
<p>Six pretty good years. Lots of good memories. Quiet times. Happy times.
Travel together. Staying home together. Going out together.
Mixing with our friends.</p>
<p>Not perfect years. I'd change a few things if I could, like Emma's health
and her two long periods of un­em­ploy­ment. I should have quit Microsoft
months before I did in 2004.</p>
<p>We celebrated by having some friends over for dinner.
<a class="reference external" href="http://ravensara.blogspot.com/">Raven</a> came with <a class="reference external" href="http://ravensara.blogspot.com/2006/04/worthy-cause-supporting-community.html">Mr. Raven</a>.
Muhsin and Banu, newly back from a long trip to Turkey, came too.

    <p>I often complain about being busy, no doubt because I have a talent for
com­pli­cat­ing my life. Things were relatively quiet for a while, but that's
not true anymore.</p>
<p>At work, we're close to releasing the first version of our product.
Happily, crunch time at Atlas isn't nearly as bad as it was at Microsoft.
Instead of working eight-ish hours a day, it's more like nine or maybe ten.
The pressure level has risen, of course, but it's far from in­tol­er­a­ble.</p>
<p>The real busyness is in my ex­tracur­ric­u­lar life. I'm the president of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.BiNetSeattle.org">BiNet Seattle</a>, a bisexual community group,
and have been for the last three years. I also <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/03/21/BusyBusyBusy.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>I was born 41 years ago today.
(Tech­ni­cal­ly, yesterday, as it's now the early hours of March 16th.)
I was to have been called Vincent after my father,
but my mother's father, George Victor Clery,
had died just 12 days before.
I was baptised George Vincent Reilly on March 17th, St. Patrick's Day.</p>
<p>Beware the Ides of March, I tell people:
You might have to buy George a present.
Better a birthday present than the reception
that Julius Caesar received on
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_Of_March">March 15th, 44BC</a>.</p>
<p>I've never liked the name George all that much,
but I've never disliked it enough to do anything about it.

    <p>This ap­pli­ca­tion to join the Republican National Committee
arrived in the mail the other day.
Hell hasn't frozen over yet,
so I won't be joining the Republican party.</p>

<p>I don't know how the RNC came up with my name,
though I got another so­lic­i­ta­tion from them a few years ago.
Usually, I get so­lic­i­ta­tions from the Dems
and from a variety of pro­gres­sive causes,
but then I have a track record of supporting them.</p>
<p>The previous owner of our house, Harry Korrell, is a Republican lawyer.
He was a member of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.preemptivekarma.com/archives/2005/02/wa_gov_rossis_l.html">Dino Rossi's team</a>
when Rossi was trying to overturn the last gu­ber­na­to­r­i­al election
in Washington state. Feh!</p>

    <p>On Tuesday night, I felt like Imelda Marcos.
I conducted a long-overdue purge of my closet,
leaving me with two large boxes of clothes, mostly shirts and t-shirts.
I probably got rid of 80% of my collection of Microsoft shirts.
All in all, I had 63 empty hangars in the closet when I was done.
Yikes!</p>
<p>Lately, I've been dressing a little better.
More button-down shirts, fewer t-shirts.
Not that there's been any pressure to do so at work --
the geeks at Atlas are just as badly, er, informally dressed
as at any other software company that I've worked at.</p>

    <p>I was looking up the credits of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332658/fullcredits">In­ter­mis­sion</a> on IMDB,
then decided to look up my brother, David Reilly,
the actor of the family.
I found <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1911562/">him</a>.</p>
<p>I couldn't find any IMDB listing for my other brother, Mark Reilly, the <a class="reference external" href="http://alienresident.net/films/films.html">filmmaker</a>.</p>
<p>Then I looked up my own name.
I wasn't there, of course, but I did find
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0404451/">Der Spleen des George Riley</a>,
a German TV production of a Tom Stoppard play,

    <p>Last Wednesday night, Emma emailed a dozen of our friends,
inviting them to join us for Thanks­giv­ing dinner.
One reply arrived the next morning. Then nothing.</p>
<p>By Sunday evening, I had grown ex­as­per­at­ed enough
to send out a snarky followup:</p>
<blockquote>
The courtesy of a belated reply would be ap­pre­ci­at­ed.
So far, we've got exactly one RSVP.</blockquote>
<p>It served its purpose. Replies cascaded in. Most, alas, said "no";
they had other plans.</p>
<p>Would that this were an isolated incident.
Time and again, I've issued in­vi­ta­tions that were not responded to.
A simple "yes" or "no" is ideal.
A "maybe" is acceptable too,
especially if you follow up with a "yes" or a "no".</p>
