<p>We married on May 6th, 2000.
We went to Vancouver for the weekend to celebrate our sixteenth an­niver­sary.
It was our first trip out of town since August,
when we returned from two months in Europe.
We drove up on Friday,
stopping in Marysville to have lunch with a friend
and to buy some clothes at the Outlet Mall.</p>
<p>On Saturday, we went up Grouse Mountain for the first time ever,
to enjoy the views on a clear day.
After that, we drove along the coast in West Vancouver
as far as the scenic village at Horseshoe Bay
and the Whytecliff Park.
We concluded the day with a fine dinner at Adesso.</p>

<p>Damn my <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supraorbital_ridge">supra­or­bital ridge</a> anyway!
I spent at least half an hour tonight scouring the entire house for a small suitcase,
only to find it within 3 feet of the back door—but above my eyeline.
Someone (probably me) had placed the suitcase on a high shelf a couple of weeks ago.
I simply didn't think to look up.
Most humans don't.
Our ancestors must not have worried too much about predators dropping from above.</p>

<p>My most recent trip to Montréal was a year ago this week for PyCon 2015,
following another trip there two years ago this week for PyCon 2014.</p>
<p>My first trip to Montréal was a very long business trip in 1995.
Four colleagues and I spent five or six weeks in Montréal,
just before the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_referendum,_1995">Quebec in­de­pen­dence referendum</a>,
working onsite for our client,
in­te­grat­ing the UI we had written into the rest of their software.</p>
<p>We had to bring our own computers, as they declined to provide us with any equipment.
In 1995, this meant shipping our desktop systems <em>and</em> our heavy CRT monitors.
Through Canadian Customs.
And back through US <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/04/04/LuggingCRTMonitorsToMontreal.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>Ad­ver­tis­ing would make you think that acne is a problem only for teenagers.
Not true.
It's never entirely gone away for me.
I often find spots on my nose.
Less often, on my chin or forehead.
I've even had a few spots inside my ears.</p>
<p>For some reason, I woke up with three spots this morning:
on the side of my nose;
under my jawline, hidden by my beard;
and on the back of my neck, near the hairline.
Go figure.</p>

    <p>I had a mole excised today.</p>
<p>I have a few moles on my body, mostly on my legs.
My doctor has disliked the look of some of my moles for years.
After my most recent annual physical,
I went to see a der­ma­tol­o­gist a month ago.
There was only one mole that she wanted to treat,
low on my left calf.
She took a biopsy,
using a tiny little saw to peel the top layer off
after the area had been numbed with a local anesthetic.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Before Biopsy</p>

<p>The results came back a week later.
The mole was “abnormal” but not cancerous.
It was rec­om­mend­ed that the rest be removed.
The skin is tight <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/03/23/MoleRemoval.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>It's better to stay calm when things aren't going well.
Stress and panic are contagious.
When you're broad­cast­ing stress or panic on all channels,
other people start picking it up.
If you can keep your cool, others are more likely to remain calm too.
Often that's for the best,
but sometimes it backfires
because others in­cor­rect­ly believe that everything is still okay.</p>
<p>Knowing when to ask for help is an art.
You learn a lot when you persevere and try different things,
many of which may fail.
The failures will likely show you where your un­der­stand­ing is deficient;
you learn some of the many ways in which things can go wrong.

It's a convention of knitters, crocheters,
and prac­ti­tion­ers of other fiber arts,
and Emma goes every year.
She takes classes and hangs out with her fellow knitters.
It's always held over Valen­tine's Day Weekend,
so I tease her about preferring knitting to romantic dinners with me.</p>

    <p>Emma and I have a bargain.
If one of us cooks a nice dinner, the other cleans up.
While I can and do cook, Emma does most of the cooking.
Therefore, I do most of the cleaning.</p>
<p>I always thank Emma during dinner for the meal,
and Emma invariably thanks me for cleaning when I'm washing pots and pans.
I—a lifelong smar­tass—usu­al­ly respond,
"Thank you for making a mess."</p>
<p>So far, she's taken this with good grace—prob­a­bly better than I deserve.
In truth, the cleanup is usually far quicker than the cooking.</p>

We're hosting two couch­surf­ing young women from Kazakhstan.
They and Raven and Iain were our dinner guests.
We roasted a leg of lamb and an assortment of root vegetables.

    <p>Aside from a few hours spent at two parties,
we've worked from when we got up until midnight
getting the bar room back in shape.
I spent a couple of hours just washing all the greasy crystal glasses this morning
(not to be confused with last night's <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2015/12/18/BarRoomBooze.html">cleaning the booze bottles</a>).
We sorted through all the cookbooks and set aside about a third of them.
The room is now ready to use again.
Alas, we've moved a pile of stuff tem­porar­i­ly into the spare room,
which will have to be dealt with soon.</p>
