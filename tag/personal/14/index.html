    <p>My good friend Frank Maloney turned 60 the other day.
A few months ago, he invited Emma and me to join him
and his partner, Lyndol,
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theherbfarm.com">The Herbfarm</a>.
The Herbfarm is one of the very best restau&shy;rants in the Seattle area.
Certainly one of the most expensive.</p>

<p>Frank brought us to The Herbfarm, but not at his own expense.
One of Frank's college roommates was Ron Zimmerman,
the owner of The Herbfarm,
and Ron had invited Frank to bring Lyndol and two guests
over for his 60th birthday.
Ron semi-seriously credits Frank with in&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;ing him to good wine,
when Frank was a sommelier in the Seventies.</p>

<p>We had a marvelous time.

<p>I have gout. It's an unpleasant form of arthritis. Once or twice a year,
one of my lower joints will swell up overnight. Usually, it's struck one of
my knees, though the last few attacks have all been in my feet. The knee
attacks have all been extremely painful initially and I've required
pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion painkillers to get to sleep at night. Just bending my knee a
few degrees is enough to make me break out in a cold sweat. For&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly,
after a few days, the pain decreases to the point where it's annoying but
tolerable.</p>
<p>Oddly, the feet <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/10/11/Gout.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>As I mentioned in <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2003/05/16/Naturalization.html">my Toast&shy;mas&shy;ter&shy;s' speech about nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;iza&shy;tion</a>, I decided
on September 11th, 2002 to become a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>This morning, I had my interview with the Bureau of Cit&shy;i&shy;zen&shy;ship and
Im&shy;mi&shy;gra&shy;tion Services (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bcis.gov/">BCIS</a>, formerly known as the INS).</p>
<p>This afternoon, I was sworn in as a U.S. citizen at the Seattle INS Office.
Eighty-three other new citizens were sworn in at the same time. Many were
Filipino, Vietnamese, Mexican, or Eastern European. Only three others, all
Brits, were from Western Europe. We were gathered into a stuffy room with
an overflow crowd of relatives and friends. <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/07/25/USCitizen.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>NAT&shy;U&shy;RAL&shy;IZA&shy;TION</p>
<p>Fellow Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters and Guests, last September, on the first
an&shy;niver&shy;sary of 9/11, I made one of the biggest decisions of my life: I
decided to apply for American cit&shy;i&shy;zen&shy;ship, to become nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;ized.</p>
<p>Like many of you, I am an immigrant. I have spent most of my adult life
in this country. Fourteen years ago, I came to the US from Ireland to
earn a Masters degree. I moved to Seattle in 1992, the same year that I
became a permanent resident. I <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/05/16/Naturalization.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>I gave the following speech to Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters on March 5th, 2003, as Speech
#3, &quot;Organize Your Speech&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SLEEP APNEA</p>
<p>My wife is a cyborg.</p>
<p>That's not to say that she's the Terminator. Nor even that she's the
six-million dollar woman, although I do value her greatly. She calls
herself a cyborg because she sleeps with a breathing machine. At night,
she wears a mask over her nose to force air into her lungs.</p>
<p>When I first met her, she complained of being tired all the time, of
not getting a good night's sleep, of feeling stupid. When she drove <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/04/24/SleepApnea.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>I've been too busy in the last few weeks to post anything here. Mostly
because I've been busy with work. Partially because I'm too disgusted with
Iraq to say anything useful: Win the war and lose the peace. Feh!</p>
<p>In the last few days, I've been at home taking care of Emma. On Friday
morning, she had a Morton's neuroma removed from her left foot. A nerve
running through the space between a couple of her toes had become enlarged
to about a centimeter in diameter, and it had been causing her a lot of
pain. She <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/04/22/HerLeftFoot.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
