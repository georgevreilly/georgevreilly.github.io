<p>This year is the 23rd an&shy;niver&shy;sary of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattleaidswalk.org/">Seattle AIDS Walk</a>.
A whole generation has passed since the Northwest AIDS Walk began.
AIDS used to be the un&shy;stop&shy;pable disease that killed much of
a generation of gay men.</p>
<p>AIDS is still a serious problem, but the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of an&shy;ti&shy;retro&shy;vi&shy;ral
drugs in the Nineties means that people with HIV
are living longer, healthier lives than before.
More than 1.5 million Americans are now living with HIV/AIDS:
9,000 of them in King County.
40,000 people are infected every year,
and most new infections are among African-Americans.
The U.S. is getting off relatively lightly:
about one-quarter of the adults in southern Africa have HIV!</p>

<p>My eight-month experiment in daily blogging will go on hiatus for a few days.
We fly out tonight and I will have only in&shy;ter&shy;mit&shy;tent Internet access
for the next three weeks in Spain and Ireland.</p>
<p>It's possible that I'll write a daily post,
but I often won't be able to post im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly.</p>

<p>We're off to Spain and Ireland tomorrow evening,
so lots of last-minute prepa&shy;ra&shy;tions tonight.
I laid out my clothes on the spare bed on Sunday;
Emma picked out hers this evening.
I've just paid some bills and I'm trans&shy;fer&shy;ring files onto the netbook that I'm bringing.</p>
<p>I still have to whittle down the large pile of books that are under con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion.
I don't want to run out before we get to Ireland,
but I don't want to take too many.
Depending on what else is going on,
I'll get through a book in a day or two when I'm on vacation.
Maybe two books on those long plane flights.</p>

<p>Two picnics this weekend.</p>
<p>Today we held the tenth annual <a class="reference external" href="http://www.binetseattle.org/">BiNet Seattle</a> picnic for the bisexual community,
which I once again organized, with some help from Emma.
Almost all of the preceding ones were held at Ravenna Park.
Even though I booked the picnic back in March,
Ravenna Park was un&shy;avail&shy;able this weekend,
which was the only weekend that really suited me.
We went to Golden Gardens Beach instead.
It's a nice park, but parking is atrocious on a busy weekend,
which may explain the poor turnout.
There were only 10 people, down from 20–30 for the last few years.
Three new faces; the rest were regulars.
As usual, Emma and I <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/07/12/Picnics.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>For weeks, Lyn has been telling us about the musical talk that
he was going to give today at his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rvuuc.org/">UU con&shy;gre&shy;ga&shy;tion</a>
about <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Strayhorn">Billy Strayhorn</a>, a little-known but talented composer,
who col&shy;lab&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ed for decades with Duke Ellington.
Strayhorn was openly gay in the homophobic decades before Stonewall.
That, coupled with his apparent liking for remaining in Elling&shy;ton's shadow,
probably con&shy;tributed to his obscurity.</p>
<p>Lyn talked about Billy Strayhorn and his life and music for half an hour.
He also ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;nied Shirley singing some Strayhorn songs on piano,
as Linda and Marion played the clarinet and cello.
He said that Stray&shy;horn's life gives rise to two questions,

<p>Lyn, Raven, and Iain came over on Friday night for dinner.
We did a little planning for Frank's memorial today
and selected some poems.</p>
<p>Emma and I packed up the car and got to Lyn's by noon,
which gave us plenty of time to set up.
I wore my com&shy;mem&shy;o&shy;ra&shy;tive <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/07/03/PortlandMotssconXXII.html">Portland motsscon</a> t-shirt,
which I know Frank would have gotten a kick out of.</p>
<p>A dozen or so of Frank's friends arrived around 2&nbsp;o'clock.
We chatted for a while waiting for Holly and Kim to arrive
after fighting through the crowded ferry system from Vashon Island.
Shirley sang <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039853/soundtrack">You're Not So Easy to Forget</a>,
while Lyn ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;nied her on the keyboard.

<p>Barely a month ago, while cleaning up Frank Maloney's Facebook account,
I became aware of <a class="reference external" href="http://motsscon.hostica.com/">Portland Motsscon XXII</a>.</p>
<p>I discovered the <a class="reference external" href="http://soc-motss.org/">soc.motss</a> newsgroup back in 1989,
when I arrived in America as a grad student at Brown and had steady access to Usenet.
MOTSS = members of the same sex, an opaque euphemism for gay attraction,
which helped the group be created with a minimum of fuss in 1983.</p>
<p>I lurked on soc.motss for two years.
I knew that I was bisexual, but I wasn't ready to admit it to anyone.
Then my friend Éamonn came out as gay and I promptly came out to him.

<p>I can't believe that I've never taken the train down to Portland before.
It's easy, it's in&shy;ex&shy;pen&shy;sive, and it's about as quick as driving without the hassle.</p>
<p>The photo is from the set of photos that I posted to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_v_reilly/sets/72157620523535885/">Flickr</a> for motsscon&nbsp;XXII,

<p>I rode on a Segway today, for the first time.
It was a lot of fun: a two-hour of Portland's waterfront
with nine other motsscon people.
I could have done without the 80°F heat though.</p>
<p>It took a few minutes for me to find my balance and to feel com&shy;fort&shy;able.
After that, it came pretty naturally.</p>
<p>Highly rec&shy;om&shy;mend&shy;ed.</p>

<p>I filled six densely packed barrels with yard waste today,
before and after the victory barbecue for the Wild Geese Players.
No wonder I'm tired.</p>
<p>Three barrels from the pile of clippings left over
from cir&shy;cum&shy;cis&shy;ing the camelia tree on Memorial Day weekend,
and another three from the big bush that Emma hates in the front rock garden.
The latter barely looks pruned at all.</p>
