    <p>I wrote this last night on Facebook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even 25 years after coming out as bisexual,
I still censor myself and still check myself about coming out yet again.
Even though Seattle is about as safe as it gets
and most people here are queer-friendly, it's reflexive.
And even in Seattle, queer bashings happen.
We came very close to an even bigger tragedy in a gay nightclub in Seattle
on New Year's Eve 2013,
when an arsonist lit a fire in Neighbours while 750 people were present.
The fire was promptly detected and put out,
no-one was injured, and the per&shy;pe&shy;tra&shy;tor is in prison.</p>

    <p>I spent the last 90 minutes reading Facebook,
and my feed has been absolutely over&shy;whelmed with Orlando-related posts,
be they grieving, discussing homophobia, calling for gun control,
or reacting to reactions.
I've never seen such a skewed set of posts.
Some of it is surely Facebook catering to what it knows are my interests,
but it seems like the vast majority of my friends
and the pages that I follow can talk of nothing else.
Even Trump/Clinton/Sanders articles, except as they pertain to this,
have tem&shy;porar&shy;i&shy;ly dis&shy;ap&shy;peared.</p>
<p>So far, I have seen nothing useful from Republican politi&shy;cians
regarding gun control or homophobia.</p>

    <p>I woke up this morning to news of another American massacre:
a lone gunman had murdered 50 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando,
and injured another 53 people.
It was the worst mass shooting in US history and also the worst hate crime.</p>
<p>I put it out of my head for the afternoon while I attended an old friend's wedding,
but it's been at the forefront of my mind ever since.</p>
<p>Only in America could we put up with massacre after massacre,
yet not find the political will to do anything meaningful about gun violence.

Barney Frank Confronts Woman at Town Hall
</div><p>Those town halls are getting uglier.</p>
<p>A dozen gun-toting paranoid guys walking around at Obama's town hall in Arizona yesterday,
some of them with ties to the violent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2009/08/az_gun-toters_tied_to_violent_90s_era_militia.php">Viper Militia</a>.</p>
<p>In the video above,
Barney Frank takes a question from some woman who's comparing Obama to a Nazi
and tells her she's talking “vile, con&shy;temptible nonsense”.</p>
<p>I hope it's not going to escalate into outright violence.</p>
