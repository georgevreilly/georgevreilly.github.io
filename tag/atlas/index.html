<p>I worked at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/">Atlas Solutions</a>, a subsidiary of aQuantive, from October 2005
to July 2007.</p>
<p>Google bought our largest competitor, Dou&shy;bleClick, for $3 Billion
in April 2007.
In the following five weeks, all the other major web ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ing companies
were bought up,
cul&shy;mi&shy;nat&shy;ing in Microsoft paying the stupendous sum of $6 billion for aQuantive.
The Microsoft-aQuantive deal closes in mid-August.</p>
<p>To put it mildly, I was not excited at the thought of becoming
a Microsoft employee yet again.
Cu&shy;mu&shy;la&shy;tive&shy;ly, between 1992 and 2005, I spent 10 years at Microsoft
as an employee or contractor,
including a year and a half on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_%28operating_system%29">Cairo</a>,
seven years on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIS">IIS</a>,

<p>Microsoft announced today that it was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSWEN823720070518">buying aQuantive</a> for $6.1 billion.
I work for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/">Atlas Solutions</a>, a division of aQuantive, so I will once
again be an employee of Microsoft when the deal closes.</p>
<blockquote>
I, for one, welcome our new corporate <a class="reference external" href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000399.html">overlords</a>.</blockquote>
<p>More truthfully, I can't honestly say that I'm overjoyed
to be part of the Borg again.
Anyone who's ever read <a class="reference external" href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/">MiniMsft</a> realizes that many MS employees
find Microsoft to be deeply dys&shy;func&shy;tion&shy;al.</p>
<p>Atlas has a pretty good corporate culture and a sane work-life balance.
I've heard plenty today about our people are our greatest asset
and that Microsoft will be mostly leaving things alone.</p>

the movie will be inserted into Comedy Central On Demand programs at
the moment that viewers request the free on-demand shows.</p>

developer teams moved from
our old offices at Fifth and Jackson in the In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al District
four blocks west to swanky offices in Pioneer Square.
The new offices are at the State building on the corner of
Occidental and Main, the pedes&shy;tri&shy;an&shy;ized block
with the antique stores and art galleries.
Occidental Park across the street has been re&shy;fur&shy;bished.
There are three coffee shops within two blocks,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/">Elliott Bay Books</a>
is one block west of us.
It's all very pleasant, with the exception of the large

<blockquote>
<p>Ever since the advent of commercial television, ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ers have
wondered exactly what they get for the megabucks they spend on
30-second spots. After all, the networks and cable companies offer only
a crude ap&shy;prox&shy;i&shy;ma&shy;tion of who is watching what. With such thin
in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion, ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ers can't target specific neigh&shy;bor&shy;hoods or
consumer tastes. As for converting ads directly to sales, well, that's
virtually impossible. Yet the Web, with its so&shy;phis&shy;ti&shy;cat&shy;ed per-click
metrics, does all of that billions of times a day. &quot;The problem,&quot; says

    <p>Back in October, I joined Atlas Solutions as a senior software engineer.
The company just held its first &quot;partner summit&quot;,
to educate some of our key partners
on the kind of work we're doing and new de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ments.
An attendee <a class="reference external" href="http://lindaburlison.blogspot.com/2006/02/atlas-partner-summit.html">blogged</a> it.
I'm working on video on demand, the stuff that Scott Ferris talked about.</p>
<p>I saw some of the pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tions being rehearsed last week,
but a lot of this is stuff that I've never seen before.
I come from a software background, after all, not an ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ing background.</p>

    <p>Two weeks ago, I completed a year as a contractor at Microsoft.
After the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permatemp">permatemps lawsuits</a>,
no contractor may work more than 12 months at Microsoft without taking a 100-day break.
(Con&shy;trac&shy;tors are free to work elsewhere, of course, during the break.)</p>
<p>Emma quit her job at washington Mutual the same week
in order to set up <a class="reference external" href="http://www.TheWheel.biz">her own business</a>.
It will be months before she starts making money,
so it seemed prudent for me to find a full-time job.</p>
<p>Last week, I in&shy;ter&shy;viewed with Amazon.
This week, I in&shy;ter&shy;viewed with
the group at Microsoft that I just left, Atlas DMT, and Google.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Atlas both made very attractive offers.
