<blockquote>
<p>Ever since the advent of commercial television, ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ers have
wondered exactly what they get for the megabucks they spend on
30-second spots. After all, the networks and cable companies offer only
a crude ap&shy;prox&shy;i&shy;ma&shy;tion of who is watching what. With such thin
in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion, ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ers can't target specific neigh&shy;bor&shy;hoods or
consumer tastes. As for converting ads directly to sales, well, that's
virtually impossible. Yet the Web, with its so&shy;phis&shy;ti&shy;cat&shy;ed per-click
metrics, does all of that billions of times a day. &quot;The problem,&quot; says

can blog during the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yarnharlot.ca/blog/olympics2006.html">2006 Knitting Olympics</a>.
What an ordeal that was!
But that's a post for another time.

<p>I decided today to create a favicon for The Wheel,

<p>A favicon is a 16x16 icon which shows up in the tab in a tabbed browser,

    <p>Back in October, I joined Atlas Solutions as a senior software engineer.
The company just held its first &quot;partner summit&quot;,
to educate some of our key partners
on the kind of work we're doing and new de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ments.
An attendee <a class="reference external" href="http://lindaburlison.blogspot.com/2006/02/atlas-partner-summit.html">blogged</a> it.
I'm working on video on demand, the stuff that Scott Ferris talked about.</p>
<p>I saw some of the pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tions being rehearsed last week,
but a lot of this is stuff that I've never seen before.
I come from a software background, after all, not an ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ing background.</p>

<p>I re-read Scott Hansel&shy;man's blog post on
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/UsingConsolasAsTheWindowsConsoleFont.aspx">using Consolas as the Windows Console Font</a>,
and I decided to put together a
<a class="reference external" href="/content/binary/console-font.reg.txt">registry file</a>
to make it a little simpler.
(You'll have to rename the file to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">console-font.reg</span></tt> after down&shy;load&shy;ing.)</p>
<p>The registry file includes entries for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/">Andale Mono</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/">DejaVu Sans Mono</a>
(an extended version of <a class="reference external" href="http://gnome.org/fonts/">Bitstream Vera</a>)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=47&amp;aid=78683">Consolas</a></li>
</ul>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>As Scott says:</dt>
<dd><em>(I'm afraid I can't distribute Consolas online
or provide a download out of abject fear.
That said, you can find it in any version of the Longhorn bits.)</em></dd>
</dl>
<p>Or Office 12, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>Update, 2008/01/15</strong>.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=22e69ae4-7e40-4807-8a86-b3d36fab68d3&amp;displaylang=en">Consolas Font Pack</a> is the easiest way to get Consolas,

    <p>Via the <a class="reference external" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/">Win Tech Off Topic</a> mailing list, I learned about <a class="reference external" href="http://pandora.com/">Pandora</a> earlier today.
It's an outgrowth of the Music Genome Project.</p>
<p>You create stations in Pandora by telling it an artist or song that you like.
It starts playing music that it thinks you will like,
based on its reasonably extensive database of carefully char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;ized music.
You can tell it if you par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly like or dislike its selections,
to guide its future offerings on that station.
You can have up to 100 per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ized stations.</p>
<p>So far, it's doing a good job.</p>

    <p>A year ago, I ran into a problem with <a class="reference external" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/george_v_reilly/archive/2004/09/15/230281.aspx">Skype squatting on port 80</a>,
which I had long forgotten about.
Today, I ran into one with Skype squatting on port 443.</p>
<p>I was trying to set up SSL on my Windows Server 2003 dev box.
My ultimate goal is to experiment with client certs and server certs for SOAP,
but that's a story for another time.
I was running into all kinds of strange problems,
ex&shy;ac&shy;er&shy;bat&shy;ed by the relatively strange IIS con&shy;fig&shy;u&shy;ra&shy;tion on my machine.</p>
<p>I tried <a class="reference external" href="https://www.iis.net/downloads/community/2009/09/ssl-diagnostics-tool-for-iis-7">SslDiag</a>.
In hindsight, it pointed me towards the underlying problem,
but I couldn't see it at the time.

    <p>Two weeks ago, I completed a year as a contractor at Microsoft.
After the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permatemp">permatemps lawsuits</a>,
no contractor may work more than 12 months at Microsoft without taking a 100-day break.
(Con&shy;trac&shy;tors are free to work elsewhere, of course, during the break.)</p>
<p>Emma quit her job at washington Mutual the same week
in order to set up <a class="reference external" href="http://www.TheWheel.biz">her own business</a>.
It will be months before she starts making money,
so it seemed prudent for me to find a full-time job.</p>
<p>Last week, I in&shy;ter&shy;viewed with Amazon.
This week, I in&shy;ter&shy;viewed with
the group at Microsoft that I just left, Atlas DMT, and Google.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Atlas both made very attractive offers.

<p>Emma bought herself a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tivo.com/1.0.asp">TiVo Digital Video Recorder</a>
a few weeks ago. I had heard it said
that TiVo changes the way you watch TV. It's true. Emma is fond of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hgtv.com/">Home and Garden Television (HGTV)</a>,
which has a lot of shows about re&shy;dec&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ing and re&shy;mod&shy;el&shy;ling. They're padded
un&shy;mer&shy;ci&shy;ful&shy;ly, constantly recapping what they showed you before the most
recent break. She can work through an ostensible 30-minute show in under 10
minutes by skipping from highlight to highlight.</p>
<p>Our TiVo also has a DirecTV satellite receiver built in, giving us access
to far more stations than we had on <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/02/10/TiVo.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
