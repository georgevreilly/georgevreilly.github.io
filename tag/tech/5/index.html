<p>I mentioned CrossLoop <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/24/CrossLoop.html">before</a>, as a tool for remotely helping someone out.
It uses VNC to share desktops.</p>
<p>The last time I looked, it was Windows only.
Now there's a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.crossloop.com/ipage.htm?id=predownload">Mac client</a> too.</p>
<p>I had to use it to help my father out in Dublin.
Somehow he had managed to delete both Adobe Reader and Adobe Flash—I haven't figured out how.</p>
<p>It was painful, painful, painful.
The connection was dropped repeatedly
and the link couldn't begin to keep up with the amount of graphical data being trans&shy;ferred.
Even though CrossLoop reduces the color depth,
actions like switching tabs in Firefox cause huge amounts of data to be sent.

<p>I serve as tech support to my parents, Frank and Lyndol,
and a handful of others.
I was at Lyn's tonight to find out why he no longer had an Internet connection.
I told him when I arrived,
&quot;This will take a minute or an hour.&quot;
Either it was going to be something that I'd spot in a moment
or I'd be fighting with it for a while.</p>
<p>I im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly noticed that the network hub was un&shy;plugged—and dared to hope that it might be just that simple.
It wasn't, of course:
the hub had been unplugged during Lyn's own fruitless trou&shy;bleshoot&shy;ing.
I quickly pinpointed that the DSL modem was not <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/05/13/AMinuteOrAnHour.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I blogged before that I had used <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2008/11/18/HardwareLazarus.html">Exact Audio Copy</a>
to rip most of my CD collection to the lossless <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Lossless_Audio_Codec">FLAC</a> format.
I haven't ripped any more CDs since then,
as the old Windows laptop that I was using had severe problems.</p>
<p>We went to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.columbiacitybeatwalk.org/">Columbia City Beatwalk</a> on Friday night.
I liked the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.correoaereo.com/">Correo Aereo</a> duo so much that I bought their CD.</p>
<p>It was time to figure out how to rip a CD to FLAC on the Mac.
I found some hints that it was possible to run Exact Audio Copy
in a virtual machine or under Wine,
but neither choice appealed to me.</p>

<p>In the late 90s when I worked on the classic Active Server Pages dev team,
I tried to convince one of the Program Managers that
we should make regular updates to <a class="reference external" href="http://classicasp.aspfaq.com/components/where-can-i-get-an-updated-version-of-browscap-ini.html">browscap.ini</a>,
the file that described browser ca&shy;pa&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ties.
He wanted no part of it.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to learn via <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=172">Hanselmin&shy;utes</a>
that Microsoft has stepped up to its re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ties and

<p>One app that I really want for my iPhone is <a class="reference external" href="http://ikeepass.de/">iKeePass</a>,
an port of the <a class="reference external" href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> password safe.
I've mentioned it <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/02/06/200KeePassEntries.html">before</a>.
I'm up to about 400 entries now.
It's completely in&shy;dis&shy;pens&shy;able to me for keeping track
of not just passwords, but identities,
and which websites I've registered on.</p>
<p>Apple is holding up approval of iKeePass, apparently in&shy;def&shy;i&shy;nite&shy;ly.
It seems to be some com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion of not wanting
to approve strong encryption for export
and hangups about open source.
Or something.
Whatever it is, it's damned annoying.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a> works on Mac and Linux and means that I can move
my password database back and forth to Windows without problem.

<p>About three weeks ago, I answered a question on Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow
about generating the <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/646068/find-most-readable-colour-of-text-that-is-drawn-on-a-coloured-surface/646328#646328">most readable color</a> of text
on a colored background.</p>
<p>I suggested flipping the top bit of each component,
<tt class="docutils literal">(r ^ 0x80, g ^ 0x80, b ^ 0x80)</tt>.
This has the same effect as adding 128 if the component is less than 128,
and sub&shy;tract&shy;ing 128 otherwise.</p>
<p>Another way to think about it is to imagine the 256x256x256 color cube.
Inside that cube, erect another cube half as wide.
One corner is at your original color
and the diagonally opposite corner is the one computed above.</p>
<p>The questioner liked my answer the best,
but I decided to experiment further.

    <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.betterthangrep.com/"></a>
<p>On a Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow question about <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21725/favorite-gvim-plugins-scripts">favorite Vim plugins</a>, I learned about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.betterthangrep.com/">Ack</a>,
a re&shy;place&shy;ment for grep that's smarter about searching source trees.</p>
<p>Ack is written in Perl.
The built-in <tt class="docutils literal">:vimgrep</tt> is rather slow.
It seems to have some Vim-specific overhead,
such as creating swap files and executing <tt class="docutils literal">BufRead</tt> autocmds.
Ack is noticeably faster,
though somewhat slower than GNU grep.</p>
<p>Which would you rather type to search a tree,
ignoring the <tt class="docutils literal">.svn</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">.git</tt> subtrees?</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
$ ack -i -l foobar
$ grep --exclude<span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'*.svn*'</span> --exclude<span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'*.git*'</span> -i -l -r foobar .
</pre>
<p>The ack takes 6 seconds to search 4500 files, while the grep completes in 2.
This does not count the time that I spent trying <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/25/AckBetterThanGrep.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I use or par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pate in a handful of wikis hosted at <a class="reference external" href="http://pbwiki.com/">PBwiki</a>.
A year ago, I wrote a <a class="reference external" href="/vim/pbwiki/">PBwiki syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing plugin for Vim</a>,
modeled after the ones that I put together for the <a class="reference external" href="/vim/flexwiki/">FlexWiki</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="/vim/stwiki/">SocialText</a> wikis.
Es&shy;sen&shy;tial&shy;ly, paste the wikitext into Vim,
get syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing, edit the text,
then paste it back into the multiline textbox.
I find the WYSIWYG editors annoying.</p>
<p>PBwiki is forcing all wikis to switch over to v2.0 by March 9th.
The good news is that the upgrade is painless and reliable.
They offer <a class="reference external" href="http://pbwiki.com/content/pbwiki-2-user-guide">new features</a>, such as an improved editor,
better access control, and a new look.</p>
