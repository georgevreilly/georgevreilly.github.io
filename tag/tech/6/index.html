<p>I'm about halfway through the 60,000-word <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/02/06/Ulysses2009Circe.html">Circe</a> chapter of Ulysses,
converting it to LaTeX.</p>
<p>For several years,
I took the plaintext from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4300">Project Gutenberg etext</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/06/16/XMLScriptsForTheTheatre.html">prepared the script in XML</a>,
used XSLT to transform it into HTML,
tarted it up with CSS,
and then saved it as a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pdfforge.org/products/pdfcreator">PDF</a>.
You can see a screenshot above.</p>
<p>I'll write up tomorrow why I switched to LaTeX last year.</p>

<p>I mentioned in my post on <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2008/11/24/reStructuredText.html">re­Struc­tured­Text</a> that I use a little command-line tool,
<a class="reference external" href="http://sigpipe.macromates.com/2005/10/11/clipboard-access-from-shell-utf-8/">pbcopy</a>, to pipe the output into the clipboard.
I finally found a similar tool for Linux, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/">xsel</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Mac: <a class="reference external" href="http://sigpipe.macromates.com/2005/10/11/clipboard-access-from-shell-utf-8/">pbcopy</a> (UTF-8 aware, unlike the built-in version of pbcopy)
copies its input to the pasteboard (Mac name for the clipboard);
pbpaste writes the pasteboard to stdout.</li>
<li>Linux: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/">xsel</a> gets and sets the X selection.</li>
<li>Windows: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/sw/outwit/winclip.html">winclip</a> reads and writes the clipboard in a variety of formats.
Use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-m</span></tt> for UTF-8 text.
The winclip binary is available as part of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/sw/outwit/">outwit</a> package.</li>

<p>For a long time, I disliked Facebook.
It seemed to consist entirely of annoying ac­quain­tances
attacking me with vampires or sending me pointless “gifts”.</p>
<p>I've used Facebook more in the last month
and it's been less annoying than I remembered it.
I check it once or twice a day and see updates
from people I know.
More en­ter­tain­ing than ex­as­per­at­ing.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/georgevreilly">Twitter</a>, though, has not clicked for me.
Brevity is good, but Twitter is too minimalist.
Stream-of-con­scious­ness ejac­u­la­tions.
Opaque URLs disdaining ex­pla­na­tion.
Feh.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToTwitterFirstStepsAndATwitterGlossary.aspx">Scott Hanselman</a> has a different take on Twitter.</p>
<p>Maybe I need to “follow” a better class of people.</p>

<p>I mentioned <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/05/20/FogIsMyCopilot.html">Copilot</a> a while back as a way of helping someone
by connecting remotely to their desktop.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.crossloop.com/">CrossLoop</a> is another such service.
If you want to charge someone for helping them out,
CrossLoop will take a cut.
Otherwise, unlike Copilot, it's completely free.
Un­for­tu­nate­ly, it's Windows only:
there's no Mac or Linux clients.</p>
<p>I've used it a couple of times to connect to my parents' computers
in Dublin and Cape Town.
It works well, though it's still painfully slow.</p>
<p>This morning's problem:
My father was no longer seeing images in his Yahoo mail.
Somehow, he had managed in Firefox to block images
on his Yahoo mail server,
and only on his Yahoo mail server.</p>

<p>For several years, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> has been my default browser.
Firefox's <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">extensions</a> have always been its paramount feature for me,
but its per­for­mance and developer tools came close.
I'm very happy with it, for the most part.</p>
<p>The one thing that makes me unhappy is Firefox 3's CPU con­sump­tion.
Time and again, I find it running at close to full uti­liza­tion of one CPU core
on my MacBook Pro.
The tipoff is usually the warmth of the metal case.
Killing the Gmail tab tends to help, but not enough.
In Firefox 2, the worst problem was the memory leaks.
Within hours, it would have chewed up several hundred megabytes.
Memory usage is <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/01/22/UsingOpera.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>We had a dry run for this in October, after he'd been in hospital for a month.

Lyndol is not tech­ni­cal­ly savvy and was unable to handle it.
I had to work out how to get into his eBay, PayPal, and email accounts.

<p>When my parents visited me in September,
I bought them a second laptop and an external drive for backup.
One laptop stays in Dublin, the other in Cape Town where they spend much of their year.
Both laptops are in Dublin with me at present,
so that I can clean them up and get them in sync.
(I had to remove some very obscure registry settings to
get one DVD drive working again. <sigh />)</p>
<p>Their backup needs are simple.
Both of them have web-based email at Yahoo!.
The only personal data on either computer is photos.
Inevitably the photos are out of sync between the two machines.</p>

while I looked on.</p>
<p>The electronic paper screen is one of the big selling points.
We found the text to be very readable, albeit black-and-white.
It works very well for its primary use case—dis­play­ing
book pages with minimal battery drain—but it's sluggish when updating menus.</p>
<p>I'm not impressed by the design of the case.
The buttons on the side are far too big;
the keyboard at the bottom is ridiculous.
It would be in­ter­est­ing to see what Apple could do.</p>

<p>We've gone high-def over the last month.
First, Emma bought a <a class="reference external" href="http://www2.panasonic.com/consumer-electronics/support/Televisions/VIERA-Plasma-HDTVs/model.TH-42PZ80U.S">42" 1080p plasma Panasonic HDTV</a>
to replace the 32" CRT TV in our living room.
Although it's wider, it's not over­whelm­ing,
as the slender box sits further back.
The picture's pretty good—at least when you give it a good signal.</p>
<p>To take advantage of it required a cascade of upgrades.
Our old TiVo served us well for eight years;
ap­point­ment TV has long been alien to us.
It's dis­con­nect­ed now, replaced the other day
by a DirecTV Plus DVR and a new satellite dish.
I had heard bad things about the older DirecTV DVRs,
but I have no complaints about this <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/10/HDTV.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
