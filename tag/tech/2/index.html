    <p>Our poster designer sent me a PDF of this year's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2016.html">Bloomsday poster</a>.
I thought the file was too large at 7.2MB and I wanted to reduce the file size
without sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant loss of image quality.
I was unable to achieve this in Preview or Acrobat Reader,
but Ghost&shy;script did the trick,
thanks to an answer on <a class="reference external" href="http://askubuntu.com/a/256449/956">AskUbuntu</a>:</p>

Many electrical devices are sold in Britain and Ireland with two-pin plugs.
Unlike US two-pin plugs,
the British two-pin plugs will <em>not</em> fit into a three-pin outlet
unless you use an adapter.
Many people would cut off the two-pin plug and wire up a three-pin plug instead.</p>

condemning DST.</p>
<p>My own dislike of DST was boosted when I worked on calendar software at Cozi.
We learned the hard way that we needed to test our latest software
ahead of both the start and end of DST each year.
That's trickier than you might think.
Setting the computer's clock forward a couple of weeks,
past the change of DST, is one thing;
getting the changed time to last for more than a few minutes is another.

    <p>It's better to stay calm when things aren't going well.
Stress and panic are contagious.
When you're broad&shy;cast&shy;ing stress or panic on all channels,
other people start picking it up.
If you can keep your cool, others are more likely to remain calm too.
Often that's for the best,
but sometimes it backfires
because others in&shy;cor&shy;rect&shy;ly believe that everything is still okay.</p>
<p>Knowing when to ask for help is an art.
You learn a lot when you persevere and try different things,
many of which may fail.
The failures will likely show you where your un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing is deficient;
you learn some of the many ways in which things can go wrong.

<blockquote>
<p>From a cryp&shy;to&shy;graph&shy;ic standpoint, PGP is rock solid.
In practice, using it is very messy.
Its complexity has deterred the vast majority of people
who might otherwise benefit from using encryption.</p>
<p>The first problem is es&shy;tab&shy;lish&shy;ing a valid identity,
especially with other people located oceans away.
The second is dis&shy;trib&shy;ut&shy;ing public keys
without nefarious types posting al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tive keys
that appear to be registered to the same person.
...
The third issue is getting people to install and use PGP software.</p>

<p>I've driven Car2go a couple of times this week.
On both occasions, while driving through downtown Seattle,
the car announced that I was outside its home area.
Presumably it tem&shy;porar&shy;i&shy;ly lost a signal
and thereby assumed that it was no longer in the home area.
Given the car knew my position and direction just moments before,
and that I was well inside the home area,
any half-way decent algorithm would have concluded
that it was physically impossible for me to be now outside the home area,
and kept its mouth shut.</p>

I assumed that Canada used the annoying US-style convention of MM/DD/YYYY.
I didn't realize that the British-style DD/MM/YYYY is also widespread.
How ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ing!</p>
<p>Personally, I always write YYYY-MM-DD whenever I can get away with it,
as God and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> intended.
