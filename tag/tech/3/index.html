<p>Apparently, there's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/proposed-legislation-aims-to-settle-date-debate-1.3407640">no standard for writing dates</a> in Canada.
I assumed that Canada used the annoying US-style convention of MM/DD/YYYY.
I didn't realize that the British-style DD/MM/YYYY is also widespread.
How ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ing!</p>
<p>Personally, I always write YYYY-MM-DD whenever I can get away with it,
as God and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> intended.
A bill is before the Canadian parliament aiming at stan&shy;dard&shy;iz&shy;ing on year-month-day formats.</p>

    <a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface"></a>
<p>We got a new monitor today for one of our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.metabrite.com/devblog/posts/pairing-git/">pairing work&shy;sta&shy;tions</a>.
At 2560x1600, it was higher resolution than its pre&shy;de&shy;ces&shy;sor.
I dis&shy;con&shy;nect&shy;ed the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface">DVI</a> cable from the old monitor,
leaving it connected to one of the video ports on the computer,
and connected it to the new monitor.
All I could see was static and noise on the screen.
After trying a variety of other things,
I eventually thought to use the DVI cable that came with the new monitor.
It worked!</p>
<p>I had assumed that all DVI cables were in&shy;ter&shy;change&shy;able.
Reading the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface">Wikipedia article</a>, I see that at higher res&shy;o&shy;lu&shy;tions,

<p>My <a class="reference external" href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> browser plugin just upgraded itself to v4.0.
For several years, I've been using LastPass to manage all of my passwords.
I have literally hundreds of passwords.
I can't even remember half the sites, much less the usernames.
With LastPass, I can maintain a strong, distinct password for each site,
which is robustly encrypted and backed up in the cloud,
and I get good browser in&shy;te&shy;gra&shy;tion and adequate Android in&shy;te&shy;gra&shy;tion.
We also use LastPass at work for our individual use
and to share cre&shy;den&shy;tials.</p>
<p>There are still a handful of passwords that I have to remember and type,
including the master password for my LastPass account,
laptop passwords,

    </header>
    <p>When I buy a book, I want to be able to read it how and where I like,
not where the bookseller dictates.
With printed books, the very idea of the bookseller having any say is ridiculous.
The book is now my property, to read where and how I like,
to give away or to lend or even to sell.
I've bought thousands of new books and thousands more secondhand books from bookstores.</p>
<p>Most electronic books are crippled with DRM.
DRM stands for <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">Digital Rights Management</a>,
although <a class="reference external" href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/">Defective By Design</a> prefers to expand DRM
as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management">Digital Re&shy;stric&shy;tions Management</a>.
DRM is technology that controls digital content <em>after</em> it has been sold.

    <p>I've always been an avid—nay, avari&shy;cious—read&shy;er of books.
But I have not been a listener of audiobooks.</p>
<p>I read quickly, much more quickly than anyone can speak,
and I enjoy burying my head in a book.
I've seen little reason, therefore, to listen to audiobooks.
Lately, however, we've listened to some audiobooks on long car trips,
as Emma, unlike me, has an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.audible.com/">Audible</a> sub&shy;scrip&shy;tion.
We enjoyed <a class="reference external" href="https://mobile.audible.com/pd/Mysteries-Thrillers/The-Hot-Rock-Audiobook/B003N9T8SA">The Hot Rock</a>, the first of the comic crime-caper <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dortmunder">Dortmunder</a> books.
Before that, I had read another Dortmunder novel, <em>Bank Shot</em>, aloud to Emma,
while she drove us back from Portland,
which both of us had enjoyed.</p>

<p>I've spent time over the last three weeks
working on a new website for the <a class="reference external" href="http://nwcpp.org/">Northwest C++ Users' Group</a>.
I blogged about the <a class="reference external" href="http://nwcpp.org/2013-website-refresh.html">NWCPP website refresh</a> over there.
In brief, I moved the website
from an instance of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a> Content Management System at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.justhost.com/">Just Host</a>
to a static website generated by <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> and hosted at <a class="reference external" href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>,
and I'm happy with the results.</p>
<p>Not only am I the Webmaster (and Secretary) of NWCPP,
I am also the webmaster for several other or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/">Wild Geese Players of Seattle</a>,

<p>I'm breaking radio silence to explain the un&shy;char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;tic drought of blog posts.
In my <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/09/16/TwibboningApprove71org.html">last post</a>, I mentioned that I had created a <a class="reference external" href="http://twibbon.com/join/Approve-Referendum-71">Twibbon overlay for Approve71.org</a>,
allowing you to overlay <a class="reference external" href="http://approve71.org/">Approve71</a>'s badge over your Twitter icon.</p>
<p>The next day I went over to Ap&shy;prove71's head&shy;quar&shy;ters and introduced
myself to the tech team, Josh, Joe, and Adam.
One thing led to another, and I spent that weekend writing my first-ever PHP code,
which allowed you to upload a photo to Ap&shy;prove71's website,
stamp a banner on it, and then save it so that you could sub&shy;se&shy;quent&shy;ly
upload it to Facebook for your profile picture.</p>

<p>The results look great on Twitter and Twibbon.</p>
<p>Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, if I save the image and upload it to Facebook as my profile picture,
it doesn't look so good.
Even if I use the FB UI to pan around in the image, the cropping ruins it.</p>
<p>I just mailed <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stormideas.com/">stormideas</a>, the people behind Twibbon,
asking if they could do something similar for Facebook profiles.</p>

The Journal is the feature that we've been working on at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cozi.com/">Cozi</a> for several months.
It's a light&shy;weight blog that's really easy to set up and post to,
with straight&shy;for&shy;ward privacy controls.</p>
<p>More im&shy;por&shy;tant&shy;ly, though, I invited those people to use Cozi for themselves.</p>

<p>I'm inviting you to read the Family Journal that Emma and I set up at Cozi.
It's a way of letting our friends and relatives keep up with us.
If you see a story you like, add a smile.
We hope you enjoy it!</p>
