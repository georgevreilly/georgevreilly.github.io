<p>My laptop scared the crap out of me last night.
I came home to find it in a completely un­re­spon­sive state:
it would not wake up. The hard disk LED was a solid green.
I power cycled it and it refused to boot.</p>
<p>It did, however, boot from a Kubuntu Edgy CD,
but it did not recognize the hard disk.
In des­per­a­tion, I booted into the BIOS and played with the disk-related menus.
That fixed the problem, but I don't know what went wrong,
and my faith is shaken in the re­li­a­bil­i­ty of this system.</p>
<p>I bought the laptop just over three years ago,
shortly before I quit Microsoft,

<p>For the last few months, every blog post that I've made has been
ac­com­pa­nied by at least one image. Sometimes I already have an ap­pro­pri­ate

<p>This means the mechanisms by which behaviour is shaped by its

The most effective training regime is one where you give the animal a
reward only sometimes, and then only at random intervals. Animals
trained like this, with what's called a 'variable interval
re­in­force­ment schedule', work harder for their rewards, and take longer
to give up once all rewards for the behaviour is removed. There's a
logic to this. Although we might know that we've stopped rewarding the

<p>I like my Americano made with 175F water to the top of the "2" oval, with
our standard ten-second stir, and press with no steep time.  Then diluted
1:1 after pressing.</p>
<p>Mark likes his brewed with much hotter water, with a 40 second steep time
and he likes to push all of the water through the press, rather than
diluting aftewards.   His recipe has much more edge (which I might call
bitterness).</p>

<p>My father emailed me with a list of computer woes; notably, he was getting
messages about no firewall. There was no way I was going to get to the
bottom of the issue just by email or talking to him on the phone. It's
5,000 miles from Seattle to Dublin, so I can't drop by to take a look at
the computer in person--much as my parents would like to have me visit.</p>

<p>I remember about two years ago, before a trip across the Atlantic, trying
to find websites that had street maps for London and Dublin -- and coming
up nearly empty.</p>
<p>Now, a year after it became available, I notice that Google Maps
covers <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.co.uk">Ireland and the UK</a>.
Un­for­tu­nate­ly, it does a piss-poor job of finding locations:
try typing anything more specific than <em>Dublin</em> into the search box.</p>
<p>Google Maps now provides a basic ability to get directions
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.spatialireland.com/archives/20060425-google-maps-adds-basic-directions-for-the-republic/">between cities</a>.</p>

your test method with an attribute, you have to declare the test method
in a header file, place it inside a macro, and then have the test

I'm using a post-build step to run the tests, which makes it
