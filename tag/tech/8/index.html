<p>For the last few months, every blog post that I've made has been
ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;nied by at least one image. Sometimes I already have an ap&shy;pro&shy;pri&shy;ate
image. The rest of the time, I use whatever I could find after searching
<a class="reference external" href="http://images.google.com/">Google Images</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today, I came across <a class="reference external" href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2006/10/10-tips-for-google-image-search.html">10 Tips for Google Image Search</a>.
I par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly like the <a class="reference external" href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2006/05/google-images-way-it-should-be.html">Grease&shy;mon&shy;key script</a> which allows you to

The most effective training regime is one where you give the animal a

trained like this, with what's called a 'variable interval

<p>I like my Americano made with 175F water to the top of the &quot;2&quot; oval, with
our standard ten-second stir, and press with no steep time.  Then diluted
1:1 after pressing.</p>
<p>Mark likes his brewed with much hotter water, with a 40 second steep time
and he likes to push all of the water through the press, rather than
diluting aftewards.   His recipe has much more edge (which I might call
bitterness).</p>

5,000 miles from Seattle to Dublin, so I can't drop by to take a look at
the computer in person--much as my parents would like to have me visit.</p>

<p>I remember about two years ago, before a trip across the Atlantic, trying
to find websites that had street maps for London and Dublin -- and coming
up nearly empty.</p>
<p>Now, a year after it became available, I notice that Google Maps
covers <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.co.uk">Ireland and the UK</a>.
Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, it does a piss-poor job of finding locations:
try typing anything more specific than <em>Dublin</em> into the search box.</p>
<p>Google Maps now provides a basic ability to get directions

your test method with an attribute, you have to declare the test method
in a header file, place it inside a macro, and then have the test

I'm using a post-build step to run the tests, which makes it

<p>Ever since the advent of commercial television, ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ers have
wondered exactly what they get for the megabucks they spend on
30-second spots. After all, the networks and cable companies offer only
a crude ap&shy;prox&shy;i&shy;ma&shy;tion of who is watching what. With such thin
in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion, ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ers can't target specific neigh&shy;bor&shy;hoods or
consumer tastes. As for converting ads directly to sales, well, that's
virtually impossible. Yet the Web, with its so&shy;phis&shy;ti&shy;cat&shy;ed per-click
metrics, does all of that billions of times a day. &quot;The problem,&quot; says
