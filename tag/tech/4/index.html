This is es­sen­tial­ly what I'm doing when I sit down
at your computer and dig you out of your latest hole.</p>
<p>If only you'd make some more in­tel­li­gent guesses for yourself,
you might be able to solve more of your problems.</p>
<p>But it's not quite that simple.</p>
<p>You probably don't understand very much about what you're doing.
I have enormous depth and breadth of experience which informs my in­ves­ti­ga­tion.
I am—no false modesty here—a master of debugging.
The extra context helps me hone in on a solution more often than not.</p>

<p>Before we left on our trip, I picked up a pair of 4GB SD cards
for my point-and-shoot Canon Elph.
I brought my <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/04/25/UbuntuNetbookRemix904.html">Linux netbook</a> along, which has a built-in SD card reader,
and the cards worked fine with that.</p>
<p>But they didn't work at all in any of the external card readers that I have,
and I had to resort to a USB cable to transfer photos from
the camera to my other computers.</p>
<p>Wikipedia discusses <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital_card#Compatibility_issues_with_2_GB_and_larger_cards">com­pat­i­bil­i­ty issues with 2GB and larger SD cards</a>,
which is initially what I thought the problem was.
On looking more closely at the cards, I see that they're the newer SDHC cards.

<p>When using Lightroom before, I was never able to figure out how
to move photos from one folder to another.
You'd think that you could just click on a photo and drag it.
I just spent twenty minutes figuring out what I've been doing wrong.
After you've selected multiple photos,
click on the <em>photo thumbnail</em> and <em>not</em> the sur­round­ing gray frame,
and then you can drag the photos to the target folder.</p>
<p>I had become accustomed to clicking on the frames to multi-select photos,
so naturally I assumed that was also how you dragged a set of photos.
But clicking on a frame of a selected photo merely deselects <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/08/16/MovingPhotosInLightroom.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>We're traveling to Spain and Ireland for three weeks.
I'm bringing the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/04/25/UbuntuNetbookRemix904.html">netbook</a>, not the 17" MacBook Pro, because it's small and light.
It doesn't have a DVD player and I'd like to bring some DVDs to watch.
I could either spend about $80 on an external DVD player,
or I could rip the DVDs beforehand.</p>
<p>I've ripped a few DVDs with <a class="reference external" href="http://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a>,
an open source, cross-platform video transcoder,
which seems to do a good job.
I'm playing them in the cross-platform <a class="reference external" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> player,
which released version 1.0.0 yesterday, after almost 8 years of de­vel­op­ment.</p>

<p>It seems no-one thought to set up a map of the events and restau­rants,

Google Maps crashed Safari 4 while trying to print the map.</p>

<p>I complained a week ago about my <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/06/12/DisplayDriverNvlddmkmStoppedRespondingAndHasSuccessfullyRecovered.html">display driver going berserk</a>.
I blamed Windows Update, since it happened within hours of a pile of updates being installed.
I upgraded to the latest beta NVidia drivers on Monday
and it helped for a while, but by Wednesday,
it was almost as bad again as it had been last Friday.
It was in­fu­ri­at­ing and I was both en­ter­tain­ing and alarming my neighbors
with my cursing.</p>
<p>Today was the last day of a very busy <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/04/25/Sprints.html">sprint</a> for me
and at last I had the time to dig into it.

for Mac and Linux yesterday.
I've tried it on my OS 10.5 MacBook and my Ubuntu Jaunty Netbook Remix netbook.</p>
<p>Chrome works fairly well, so far.
It seems slow at resolving hostnames,
but otherwise downloads pages quickly.
Rendering speed is good.
Gmail comes up in an amazingly short time, as in Windows Chrome.
It uses less CPU than Safari or Camino.</p>
<p>Favicons are not showing up in tabs on Mac.
Fonts are not an­tialiased on Linux.</p>
<p>As a user, I'm happy to see that there is real com­pe­ti­tion between the browsers
after the stagnation in the first half of this decade, when IE6 ruled.

I had to paste them in one-by-one, clicking Add for each one.

<p>I mentioned CrossLoop <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/24/CrossLoop.html">before</a>, as a tool for remotely helping someone out.
It uses VNC to share desktops.</p>
<p>The last time I looked, it was Windows only.
Now there's a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.crossloop.com/ipage.htm?id=predownload">Mac client</a> too.</p>
<p>I had to use it to help my father out in Dublin.
Somehow he had managed to delete both Adobe Reader and Adobe Flash—I haven't figured out how.</p>
<p>It was painful, painful, painful.
The connection was dropped repeatedly
and the link couldn't begin to keep up with the amount of graphical data being trans­ferred.
Even though CrossLoop reduces the color depth,
actions like switching tabs in Firefox cause huge amounts of data to be sent.

<p>I serve as tech support to my parents, Frank and Lyndol,
and a handful of others.
I was at Lyn's tonight to find out why he no longer had an Internet connection.
I told him when I arrived,
"This will take a minute or an hour."
Either it was going to be something that I'd spot in a moment
or I'd be fighting with it for a while.</p>
<p>I im­me­di­ate­ly noticed that the network hub was un­plugged—and dared to hope that it might be just that simple.
It wasn't, of course:
the hub had been unplugged during Lyn's own fruitless trou­bleshoot­ing.
