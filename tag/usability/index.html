<p>When I was a boy, anytime we said ‘Dundrum’ (a suburb of Dublin),
it was with a snigger, because it was synonymous in our minds
with the <a class="reference external" href="http://wikimapia.org/72462/Central-Mental-Hospital-Dundrum">mental asylum</a> located there.
Nowadays, Dundrum is much better known as the home of a large
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dundrum.ie/">shopping centre</a>.
I'm so out of touch with Dublin that I hadn't realized
that there was a major new shopping centre there.
I assumed that people were talking about the unim&shy;pres&shy;sive
little centre that I remembered there from my childhood.
Until today, when we went there to return the
mobile phone that we had given my mother for Christmas.</p>
<p>Dundrum was, indeed, a madhouse.
There's much talk of a <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/27/Dundrum.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>I've been hanging out on the dasBlog de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;er&shy;s' mailing list for the last
couple of months, and I've made some minor con&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tions to the code.</p>
<p>I sent the following email to the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;er&shy;s' list last night.</p>

<p>My wife has decided to start a blog for
<a class="reference external" href="http://thewheel.biz/TeamIreland">Team Ireland</a> in the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.yarnharlot.ca/blog/olympics2006.html">2006 Knitting Olympics</a>,
and she asked me to install <a class="reference external" href="http://dasblog.info">dasBlog</a> on her site.
I decided that this was an excellent op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ty to do some usability testing
on the in&shy;stal&shy;la&shy;tion in&shy;struc&shy;tions for dasBlog. I asked her to try installing
dasBlog, while I watched. I promised that I would bail her out if she got
mired too deeply.</p>

    <p>I cannot look at a 16-digit credit card number
and tell whether I've mistyped it or not.
And neither can anyone else.
I can, however, easily examine four separate four-digit numbers and spot typos.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">1341329913245890</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">1341 3299 1324 5890</tt>?
The choice is obvious.
Yet most websites will not accept anything but the 16-digit string.
It's a trivial matter to strip the spaces and normalize the credit card number,
and it speaks to the in&shy;com&shy;pe&shy;tence of many website developers that they don't do this.
The cognitive burden should be pushed onto the programmer, not the user.</p>
<p>On a related note, Irish people write phone numbers as a seven-digit string.
