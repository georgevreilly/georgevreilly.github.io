    <p>I was trying to get some structured in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion from <tt class="docutils literal">docker images</tt>,
hoping to replace some ugly Sed and AWK trickery.
I could have used the <a class="reference external" href="https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">docker-py</a> library.
Instead I chose to use the poorly documented <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--format</span></tt> option to <tt class="docutils literal">docker images</tt>
(and some other Docker CLI commands).
Adrian Mouat gives some useful starting points at <a class="reference external" href="http://container-solutions.com/docker-inspect-template-magic/">Docker Inspect Template Magic</a>
and notes that formatting is built around <a class="reference external" href="https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/">Go templates</a>.</p>
<p>I quickly figured out that this format would meet my immediate need.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo docker images --format <span class="s1">&#39;{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}&#39;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="p">|</span> grep <span class="nv">$IMAGE_NAME</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="p">|</span> grep -v latest <span class="se">\</span>

<p>I attended <a class="reference external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161121204237/http://2016.dockercon.com/">DockerCon 2016</a> in Seattle
over the last two days and I learned a lot.
It was a well-run conference with an en&shy;thu&shy;si&shy;as&shy;tic audience.</p>
<p>I'm astounded at the growth of Docker.
Three-and-a-quarter years ago,
Docker was revealed to the public for the first time,
in a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW9CAH9nSLs">five-minute lightning talk</a> at PyCon 2013.
In January 2016, Docker Hub had received <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.docker.com/2016/02/docker-hub-two-billion-pulls/">1.6 billion image pulls</a>;
by this month, that number had jumped to over 4 billion pulls!
DockerCon had over 4,000 attendees and nearly 100 exhibitors,
who clearly believe there's a multi-billion dollar market for containers.

    <p>I complained <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/06/18/17/DeployingDockerContainersOnAWSPart2.html">yesterday</a> about my dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ties in deploying Docker containers on AWS.
I have since succeeded in getting my app to deploy on Elas&shy;ticBeanstalk,
though I have not quite ironed out all the problems.</p>
<p>I found several problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I had to revert from a Multi-Container Docker en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment
to a Single-Container Docker en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment
because ECS wasn't starting in the multi-container en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment.
That meant I had to revert to a v1 <tt class="docutils literal">Dockerrun.aws.json</tt>.</li>
<li>I had to ensure that the Instance Profile had the
Ama&shy;zonEC2&shy;Con&shy;tain&shy;erReg&shy;istryRead&shy;On&shy;ly policy attached,
so that I could pull from the EC2 Container Repository.</li>

    <p>I complained <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/05/24/DeployingADockerContainerOnAWS.html">a few weeks ago</a> about how hard it was to deploy Docker containers on AWS.</p>
<p>This week has been nothing but container-related frus&shy;tra&shy;tion.
We have two apps running in Kubernetes clusters on top of AWS.
This is not a well-supported scenario and we have a fragile script
that spends a lot of time sitting in polling loops,
waiting for various things to happen like DNS updates taking effect,
the new cluster being available, and so on.
One of the apps has decided to stop deploying.
I do not know why.</p>
<p>I've been trying to get a new app deployed on ECS, the EC2 Container Service.

<p>I spent a couple of frus&shy;trat&shy;ing hours this evening
trying to figure out an easy way to deploy a Docker container on AWS.
I tried out the <a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">EC2 Container Service</a> and got lost
in a sea of Clusters, Tasks, and Services.
I couldn't connect to the EC2 instance where my container supposedly lived.</p>
<p>I tried <a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Elastic Beanstalk</a> and gave up in ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;a&shy;tion.
When you create a new Docker en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment,
there's no way to pull an existing image from an external repo
that I could see.
We have some tools for deploying a Docker image to Elastic Beanstalk,
but they were so cryptic that I didn't want to pursue that.</p>
