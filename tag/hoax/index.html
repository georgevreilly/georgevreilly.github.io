<p>Some days on Facebook,
it seems like I spend half my time being <em>that guy</em>,
the killjoy who debunks the false memes.
One that I've debunked many times in the last few weeks
is the one that claims Sandra Day O'Connor
called the GOP a group of &quot;vile, petulant, hateful&quot; ob&shy;struc&shy;tion&shy;ists.
Although I (and many of my friends) agree with that sentiment,
O'Connor never said it.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.snopes.com/">Snopes</a>—as usual— is on the job
and points out that the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.snopes.com/sandra-day-oconnor-quote/">GOP Ob&shy;struc&shy;tion&shy;ists</a> meme
is due to sloppy punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion that then went viral.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://usvsth3m.com/post/no-this-isnt-a-real-1970s-anti-drink-driving-ad"></a>
<p>In the last week, I've seen what purports to be a poster
from a 1970s anti-drink driving campaign,
often supposedly in Ireland,
which says,
“Driving? Don't <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/04/11/DebunkingMemes.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I got an email earlier today from one of my relatives who has ties to South
Africa, which read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week a 3 year old girl (in South Africa ) was beaten and raped. She is
still alive. The man re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;ble was released on bail yesterday. He is
walking the streets. If you are too busy to read this then just sign your
name and forward this on. The Government is planning to close the child
protection unit and this is a petition against it. This is a very important
petition. It is an essential part of the justice system for children. You
may have already heard that <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/07/28/ChainMailHoaxes.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>
