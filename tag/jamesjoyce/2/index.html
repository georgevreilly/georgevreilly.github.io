<p>As promised <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/05/14/CirceRehearsal.html">yesterday</a>, I'm posting the poster for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2009.html">Circe reading</a>.
It's a fine painting by Ellen Coyle.
The shrunken image here doesn't do it justice.

<p>We're rehearsing most Wednesdays for our reading of the
first half of the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/04/30/Bloomsday2009PressRelease.html">Circe chapter of Ulysses</a> next month.
It's going well.
We need some more rehearsal, but it now sounds like we know what we're doing.
Tonight we read the entire piece through from beginning to end,
for the first time.
Now we know that it takes two-and-a-quarter hours.</p>
<p>We also got the poster tonight.
It looks great!
I'd post it, but I need to get the painting scanned first.</p>

<p>I just sent out the following press release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will perform a staged reading of <em>Circe</em>,
chapter 15 of James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>,
on Saturday, June 13th, 2009, 1:30-4pm
at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bookstore.washington.edu/">University Bookstore</a>, 4326 University Way NE, Seattle, WA 98105.
Donations towards costs of posters and props are welcome.</p>
<p>It is late on the night of June 16th, 1904,
and Leopold Bloom has followed Stephen Dedalus
into Dublin's red-light district.
Bloom has a paternal concern for Stephen's welfare
and knows that Stephen is now very drunk.
In the <em>Circe</em> chapter of Homer's <em>Odyssey</em>,
the witch-goddess Circe transforms Odysseus' crew into swine.
In Joyce's version, Bloom will have hal&shy;lu&shy;ci&shy;na&shy;to&shy;ry encounters
with <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/04/30/Bloomsday2009PressRelease.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>As I mentioned the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/04/06/CirceSecondDraft.html">other night</a>,
I introduced two narrators into the chapter of Ulysses
that we're reading in June.</p>
<p>I'd say from the rehearsal tonight that the additions are successful,
that they clarify the text for the listener,
without being intrusive.
I expect that I'll have to produce a third draft of the script in a few weeks,
but I think the next round of changes will be minor.
The second draft required hundreds of small changes.</p>
<p>We gained three new readers tonight.
There are plenty of parts to go around, so it's all to the good.
We had great difficulty initially last year in
getting enough readers from the old <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/04/08/NarratorsInCirce.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Moments ago, I completed the second draft of the Circe Part I script
for this year's Ulysses reading.</p>
<p>The chapter is couched in the form of a play,
making it relatively straight&shy;for&shy;ward to convert to a staged reading.
There are, however, huge numbers of “stage di&shy;rec&shy;tion&shy;s”,
often ironic, generally unactable:
A vast, detailed procession in Bloom's honor;
Bloom burning at the stake;
camels offering mangoes to Molly;
and much, much more.</p>
<p>In addition, there are over one hundred characters,
most of whom have a line or two, then disappear.
They need to be introduced somehow.</p>
<p>So I added two narrators to handle all of this.
They steer the reading along,
adding much-needed context to aid <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/04/06/CirceSecondDraft.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I am co-directing this year's reading of <em>Ulysses</em> with Helen.
We have decided to do the first half of the chapter with some light cuts.
The Circe character, Bella Cohen, will not be seen until next year,
as we'll be stopping shortly before she makes her entrance.</p>
<p>We had a readthrough-cum-planning meeting ten days ago at Helen's
and a rehearsal tonight at my house.
We'll need several more rehearsals, but it's starting to come together.</p>
<p>We'll be reading at the University Bookstore on Saturday, June 13th.</p>

<p>I have a long-standing fas&shy;ci&shy;na&shy;tion with typography.
In the late '80s and early '90s, I became quite <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=gvr@cs.brown.edu+LaTeX">adept with TeX and LaTeX</a>,
the well-known <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">scientific type&shy;set&shy;ting system</a>.
When I was at <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/02/02/LeavingIrelandPart1.html">ICPC</a>, I think I read the <a class="reference external" href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/abcde.html">TeXbook</a> cover to cov&shy;er—twice.
I became the TeX ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tor for the CS department while I was at Brown.</p>
<p>And then I moved to Seattle to work for Microsoft
and entered the world of Windows,
and I left TeX behind for more than 15 years.</p>
<p>I wrote the other day that I prepared the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/">Bloomsday</a> scripts in <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/02/16/DramaturgyXML.html">XML</a>

<p>It's time to start thinking about this year's reading of <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2008/06/10/Bloomsday2008.html">Ulysses</a>
for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/index.html">Wild Geese Players of Seattle</a>.
The next chapter to be tackled is <a class="reference external" href="http://ksumail.kennesaw.edu/~mglosup/ulysses/circe.html">Circe</a>,
the nightmare scene in the brothel.</p>
<p>Most chapters require a lot of work to tease apart into a staged reading,
to make sense of the different threads of Bloom's inner monologue,
or to attribute fragments of con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion to different characters, for example.
This chapter is written in the form of a play;
at&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tion is easy.</p>
<p>But <em>Circe</em> is also <em>enormously</em> long: some 60,000 words.
For comparison, many novels are in the range 80–100,000 words.
<a class="reference external" href="/blog/2008/06/10/Bloomsday2008.html">Last year's chapter</a> was 20,000 words and I cut 5,000 words <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/02/06/Ulysses2009Circe.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

Leopold Bloom visits the Holles Street Maternity Hospital
and falls in with Stephen Dedalus
and a crowd of drunken medical students,
in a chapter that not only
re&shy;ca&shy;pit&shy;u&shy;lates the forty weeks of pregnancy,
it also con&shy;sti&shy;tutes a tour through
the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of the English language.</p>
<p>I play Stephen Dedalus, the second most important character of the book.
In this chapter, it is neither a large nor a small role.</p>
