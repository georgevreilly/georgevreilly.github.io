<p>I bought a 2TB external hard disk today.
It's about the size of a deck of cards, but thinner,
and it cost me $95.
Disk Utility says it has 2,000,397,884,928 bytes.</p>
<p>In 1998, I got to see more than three terabytes of disks in one system.
At the time, a server with a 25GB disk was considered high capacity.
The 3TB system occupied con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;ably more volume than a pack of cards.
I don't know what it cost
but clearly it was tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>At that time, I was a developer on the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services">IIS</a> team at Microsoft.
I was the lead per&shy;for&shy;mance engineer for Mi&shy;crosoft&shy;'s <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2015/01/30/TerraServer.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Microsoft announced today that it was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSWEN823720070518">buying aQuantive</a> for $6.1 billion.
I work for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/">Atlas Solutions</a>, a division of aQuantive, so I will once
again be an employee of Microsoft when the deal closes.</p>
<blockquote>
I, for one, welcome our new corporate <a class="reference external" href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000399.html">overlords</a>.</blockquote>
<p>More truthfully, I can't honestly say that I'm overjoyed
to be part of the Borg again.
Anyone who's ever read <a class="reference external" href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/">MiniMsft</a> realizes that many MS employees
find Microsoft to be deeply dys&shy;func&shy;tion&shy;al.</p>
<p>Atlas has a pretty good corporate culture and a sane work-life balance.
I've heard plenty today about our people are our greatest asset
and that Microsoft will be mostly leaving things alone.</p>

<p>I've seen a number of references to a Microsoft demo of speech recog&shy;ni&shy;tion
that went famously wrong, but it wasn't until this evening that I finally
watched the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/11/03/VistaSpeechRecognitionSnafuInContext.html/originalvideo_">CNBC Video</a> that started the meme.</p>
<p>A TV reporter makes a snarky in&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;tion then cuts to video of a Microsoft
PM demoing the new speech recog&shy;ni&shy;tion technology in Windows Vista.
<tt class="docutils literal">Dear Mom comma</tt>, he says. <tt class="docutils literal">Dear aunt,</tt> appears in Word. It gets worse
from there. Funny stuff. Go watch the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y_Jp6PxsSQ">original video</a>.</p>
<p>But it's not the whole story. There's <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/11/03/VistaSpeechRecognitionSnafuInContext.html/contextvideo_">another video</a> which sets the demo
in context. Overall, the demo was reasonably successful and the speech
commands worked fairly well.</p>

A year later, I said that I was moving on, because my <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/09/18/JobHunting.html">12 months were up</a>.
In both cases, I said that I was doing some really in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing work and
that I hoped to be able to talk about it some day.</p>
<p>Now the truth can be told: I was working on
