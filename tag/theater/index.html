<p>I'm familiar with most of Shake&shy;speare's plays,
but not only had I never seen <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymbeline">Cymbeline</a> before today,
I knew nothing about it.
While the per&shy;for&shy;mance we saw was enjoyable,
I began to see why it's one of the lesser-known plays.
It's one of Shake&shy;speare's later, minor comedies,
with such familiar elements as
a cross&shy;dress&shy;ing heroine,
confused and separated lovers,
false ac&shy;cu&shy;sa&shy;tions of infidelity,
stolen princes,
a knavish villain who gets his come&shy;up&shy;pance,
and a loyal servant.
It's easy to see a tired Shake&shy;speare
trotting out yet another comedy to amuse the groundlings.</p>

<p>I mentioned three weeks ago that I was putting together a group of people
to see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.greenstage.org/2009/comedyoferrors">Greenstage</a>'s production of Shake&shy;speare's <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/06/24/ShakespeareInTheParkComedyOfErrors.html">Comedy of Errors</a>
at the Seward Park Am&shy;phithe&shy;ater.
Six of us braved the rain last night,
ate our picnic, and enjoyed an hour and a half of ribald slapstick.</p>
<p>Almost all of the cast cross-dressed.
The main male parts, the two sets of identical twin brothers, were played by women,
The wife, her sister, and the courtesan were played by ugly men
in the best <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantomime_dame">panto dame</a> tradition.</p>
<p>The play, like so many of Shake&shy;speare's comedies,
requires an endless series of confused identities,
which could be cleared up in moments
if only <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/07/14/ComedyOfErrors.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>We saw <em>The Seafarer</em> at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattlereptickets.org/Plays/0809/SF/">Seattle Rep</a> this afternoon.
Two brothers, Richard and Sharkey, share a house in north Dublin.
There's little love lost between them.
Richard, recently blinded, is con&shy;trol&shy;ling and wheedling.
Sharkey is trying to stay off the gargle
and it's not easy when Richard and his crony Ivan drink like fishes.</p>
<p>Sharkey's old rival, Nicky, arrives on Christmas Eve,
bringing a stranger with him, Mr. Lockhart.
They settle down to a game of poker
and Sharkey privately learns that he's met the stranger once before.
For Mr. Lockhart is the devil and he wants to collect the old <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/09/ReviewTheSeafarer.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I gave the following speech to Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters on October 1st, 2003, as Speech
#5, &quot;Vocal Variety&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SPOLIN GAMES</p>
<p>Spolin Games. That sounds like it could be a new set of titles for the
Xbox.</p>
<p>Far from it.</p>
<p>The Spolin Games are a set of improv theater games invented by Viola
Spolin in the nineteen-thirties, and refined by her for the next six
decades. These games are used in im&shy;pro&shy;vi&shy;sa&shy;tion&shy;al work, to help bring
out creativity and spon&shy;tane&shy;ity. Viola's son, Paul Sills, founded the
Second City improv theater company in Chicago back in the
nineteen-fifties.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to the Spolin Games <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/10/07/SpolinGames.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>
