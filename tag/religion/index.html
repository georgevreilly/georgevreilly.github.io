<p>We received an un­so­licit­ed copy of this ridiculous book in the mail.
It drones on and on about Satan and his plans,
bashing both Catholics and Protes­tants.
Apparently, ‘Sunday worship is “the mark of the beast!”’.
Who knew? Who cares.</p>
<p>I assumed that it's from the Seventh Day Adventists,
though I couldn't confirm that from skimming it.
However, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.catholic.com/tracts/seventh-day-adventism">Catholic Answers</a> confirms my guess.</p>
<p>Best avoided, especially on Sundays.</p>

<p>Nine years ago, the Ryan Commission was set up to produce
a report on physical, emotional, and sexual abuse of children
in Catholic Church–run re­for­ma­to­ries in Ireland.
This week, they released a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/europe/21ireland.html">2600-page report</a>
detailing abuse to tens of thousands of children from the 1930s to the 1990s.
The abuse and violence were systemic and in­sti­tu­tion­al­ized, if not universal,
and they were hushed up and overlooked for decades.
The stories of the abused, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0523/1224247210382.html">in their own words</a>, make for horrifying reading.
It's a national disgrace.</p>

<p>The Pope has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/world/europe/25pope.html">reinstated</a> four ex­com­mu­ni­cat­ed bishops:</p>

Pope Benedict XVI, reaching out to the far-right of the Roman Catholic Church,
revoked the ex­com­mu­ni­ca­tions of four schismatic bishops on Saturday,
including one whose comments denying the Holocaust have provoked outrage.</blockquote>

<p>I'm traveling in Europe at present
(Ireland last week, Italy this week and next),
so I have little op­por­tu­ni­ty to keep up with U.S. news,
but the Larry Craig case leapt out at me.
Craig is the second U.S. Senator
to be exposed in the last few months
as a major sexual hypocrite who espouses 'family values'
but can't keep his pecker in his pants.

<p>Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority, died today.

Falwell was a liar, a hate-monger, a parasite, and a crook.</p>
