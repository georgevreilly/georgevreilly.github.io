<p>We received an un&shy;so&shy;licit&shy;ed copy of this ridiculous book in the mail.
It drones on and on about Satan and his plans,
bashing both Catholics and Protes&shy;tants.
Apparently, ‘Sunday worship is “the mark of the beast!”’.
Who knew? Who cares.</p>
<p>I assumed that it's from the Seventh Day Adventists,
though I couldn't confirm that from skimming it.
However, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.catholic.com/tracts/seventh-day-adventism">Catholic Answers</a> confirms my guess.</p>
<p>Best avoided, especially on Sundays.</p>

<p>Nine years ago, the Ryan Commission was set up to produce
a report on physical, emotional, and sexual abuse of children
in Catholic Church–run re&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;to&shy;ries in Ireland.
This week, they released a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/europe/21ireland.html">2600-page report</a>
detailing abuse to tens of thousands of children from the 1930s to the 1990s.
The abuse and violence were systemic and in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ized, if not universal,
and they were hushed up and overlooked for decades.
The stories of the abused, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0523/1224247210382.html">in their own words</a>, make for horrifying reading.
It's a national disgrace.</p>

Pope Benedict XVI, reaching out to the far-right of the Roman Catholic Church,
revoked the ex&shy;com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tions of four schismatic bishops on Saturday,
including one whose comments denying the Holocaust have provoked outrage.</blockquote>

was just as important as saving the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/22/europe/23pope.php">rainforest</a> from de&shy;struc&shy;tion.</blockquote>

Craig is the second U.S. Senator
to be exposed in the last few months
as a major sexual hypocrite who espouses 'family values'
but can't keep his pecker in his pants.

<p>Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority, died today.

Falwell was a liar, a hate-monger, a parasite, and a crook.</p>
