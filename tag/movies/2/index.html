<p>Millenia ago, the Dark Elves almost destroyed the Nine Realms
with their ultimate weapon known as the Aether.
Now the Con&shy;ver&shy;gence, when the Nine Realms briefly align, is imminent
and the surviving Dark Elves have returned to reclaim the Aether.
Meanwhile on Midgard (Earth),
as&shy;tro&shy;physi&shy;cist Jane Foster discovers portals linking the realms,
whereupon she in&shy;ad&shy;ver&shy;tent&shy;ly becomes the host of the Aether.
Thor rescues his lover and brings her to Asgard.
Many battles ensue across the Nine Realms
as Thor prevents the Elves from invoking the Aether at the Con&shy;ver&shy;gence.</p>

<p>By 2154, the rich have moved off-planet to a utopic habitat,
while the teeming billions languish in slums below.
Elysium has Med-Bays which can cure anything; Earth scrapes by.
Max (Matt Damon), an ex-con des&shy;per&shy;ate&shy;ly in need of a cure,
agrees to shoot down the shuttle of an Elysian CEO and hijack his brain.
This lethal variety of industrial espionage leaves him holding the keys of the kingdom
and makes him Los Angeles' most wanted.</p>
<p>Blomkamp has taken the ever-growing gap that exists between rich and poor today,

<p>Andy Osnard (Pierce Brosnan) is a disgraced MI6 officer, packed off to Panama,
where he recruits Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush), the eponymous tailor.
Osnard is an un&shy;scrupu&shy;lous dirtbag;
Pendel is a fabulist in need of money;
they're made for each other.
Panama is “Casablan&shy;ca without the heroes”
and Pendel spins tall tales that make their way back to London.
Eventually, he outdoes himself, claiming that the Canal is to be sold to the Chinese.
Osnard manages to procure $15 million to fund a revolution,
which he plans to abscond with.</p>

became the only Irishman ever deported from Ireland.
Gralton returns to rural Ireland from the US in 1932,
after being run out ten years' earlier
during the Irish Civil War for Communist activity.
He revives the dance hall he had built previously,
as it is a much-needed outlet for the young to dance, study, and talk,
and im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly runs afoul of the local powers,

<p>As I watched <em>In&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dence Day 2</em>,
I disliked it more and more,
to the point where I was seething with anger
at the stupidity of the plot and the characters.</p>
<p>The original 1996 <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(1996_film)">In&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dence Day</a> was at least a watchable B-movie.
The sequel is leaden and plodding and makes no sense.
The characters are per&shy;func&shy;to&shy;ry and un&shy;in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing,
while the comic reliefs are teeth-grindingly irritating.
You might assume that the young pilot who is the son of Will Smith's character
would be the lead in this film,
but he's sidelined here by Liam Hemsworth as the Top Gun jock.</p>
