<p>Two years ago, just after the death of Richard Adams,
I reread the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2017/01/01/ReviewWatershipDown.html">book</a> of <em>Watership Down</em>
for the first time in many years,
having originally discovered it when it was new
in the mid-1970s.
There's a beautiful new adaptation,
an animated <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down_(miniseries)">miniseries</a> made by the BBC and Netflix.</p>
<p>This adaptation is largely faithful to the original book:
The brave young rabbits striking out on their own
before their home warren is destroyed;
creating a new warren on Watership Down;
the war with the to­tal­i­tar­i­an warren of Efrafa;
the peaceful aftermath.
One short­com­ing is that

<p>A jealous husband engages
a private detective-cum-killer for hire (Simon Pegg) to follow his wife.
Upon proof of her infidelity, he orders a hit,
which triggers a comedy of errors and double crosses,
which ultimately leaves most of the cast dead at each other's hands.</p>
<p>There's not much to like about this Australian noirish comedy.
It's bloody but not that funny.
The characters are thinly drawn and unengaging.
They're a far cry from Taran­ti­no's gonzo mo­tor­mouths
or the Coen Brother's quirky killers.</p>

His hands are ruined by a car crash, leaving him desperate to regain their use.
In Nepal, he finds a temple of sorcerers led by the Ancient One,

Eventually he takes on the renegade sorcerer Kaecilius,
who wants to summon Dormammu from the Dark Dimension to change the world.</p>

the eponym is back in action, running around the planet
in a personal vendetta with the director of the CIA.
Bourne's old ally Nicky Parsons is killed trying to pass him some in­for­ma­tion
that she's unearthed about the Treadstone program
that turned David Webb into the amnesiac assassin known as Jason Bourne.
The CIA director sends a killer known only as the Asset after Bourne,
while the fresh-faced head of the Cyber Ops division does her best to keep Bourne alive.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters_(2016_film)">Ghost­busters</a> remake is a light­weight but enjoyable summer comedy and a lot of fun.
Four women, mostly dis­cred­it­ed scientists, fight an increasing number of paranormal incursions
and kick some as­s—with­out wearing skintight clothing or being adjuncts to male leads.
Internet trolls may be outraged but the non-tra­di­tion­al casting works.
Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones are funny and jell together.
And Chris Hemsworth as the hunky but dim re­cep­tion­ist is an amusing bit of reverse casting,
while Kate McKinnon seems to have become a <a class="reference external" href="http://the-orbit.net/teacosy/2016/07/21/jillian-holtzmann-is-queer-as-a-salty-parabola-and-not-here-for-the-straight-people/">queer icon</a> overnight.</p>
