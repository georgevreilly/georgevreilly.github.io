<p>The Coen Brothers' latest movie, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail,_Caesar!">Hail, Caesar!</a>, is a lot of fun.
I've been looking forward to it since the trailers showed up a few months ago.
It's a homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood,
an age where quirky talents like the Coens
could not have made Coen Brothers' movies.
We see song and dance numbers, syn­chro­nized swimming,
singing cowboys, and ballroom dramas.
Most of all, we see a big-budget swords-and-sandals epic,
whose star, Baird Whitlock, has been kidnapped by The Future,
a group of Communist screen­writ­ers,
and is being held for $100,000 ransom.
Eddie Mannix is the studio fixer who has to wrangle
the studio's stars and keep them out <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/02/25/ReviewHailCaesar.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

as part of its <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cinerama.com/News/January-2015/Eight-Days-of-Oscar.aspx">Eight Days of Oscar</a>—<em>Fury Road</em> having being nominated for ten Oscars,
including Best Picture and Best Director.
I have no idea if it will win any awards from the Academy,
but it's no ordinary action movie.</p>
<p>Action there is aplenty,
a kinetic feast of racing cars and roaring maniacs
that rarely lets up.
Imperator Furiosa and Max flee across the desert,
taking Immortan Joe's five nubile wives to a better place.
They seek hope, Furiosa seeks redemption, and Max seeks mostly to survive.
Furiosa sets the plot in motion;

<p>We saw <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film)">The Big Short</a> tonight,
which does a creditable job
of explaining the basics of the 2008 financial collapse.
It's written as a comedy-drama,
which makes it far more watchable and en­ter­tain­ing than a more sober doc­u­men­tary.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infodump">infodumps</a> are cleverly handled,
often breaking the fourth wall with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/2015/12/big-short-understanding-economics/">celebrity explainers</a>.
The characters let their anger and outrage at Wall Street fraud­u­lence
bleed through oc­ca­sion­al­ly, as well they should.
I'm appalled that not only did no one go to jail,
but that the too-big-to-fail banks are bigger now than they ever were.</p>

<p>We attended the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sherlock-seattle.org/">Sherlock Seattle Mini-Convention</a>
at the Broadway Per­for­mance Hall.
It was much more lightly attended than previous

<p>The final event of the evening was

<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_(2010_film)">Sherlock Holmes (2010 film)</a>
given by some of the con's organizers.
We had seen <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Sherlock_Holmes">Young Sherlock Holmes</a> get the MST3K treatment at last year's con
and the show was quite funny.
This show was also funny,
but I was appalled at just how bad <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> was.
(I suppose that's the point of getting the MST3K treat­men­t—the movie stinks and deserves to be heckled.)
It was totally incoherent and anachro­nis­tic and ineptly made.</p>

<p><em>Legend</em> loving recreates London in the Swinging Sixties
when the Kray twins were not only notorious gangsters but also celebri­ties,
mingling with the rich and famous in their nightclubs.
Reggie is portrayed as the smarter, charming, and stable brother;
Ronnie as erratic and psy­cho­pathic;
both are capable of great violence.
The film is narrated from beyond the grave by Reggie's wife, Frances,
and con­cen­trates mostly on Reggie.
Hardy is excellent as Reggie, but hard to understand as Ronnie,

<p>We have three non-tra­di­tion­al Christmas movies
that we watch almost every December,

and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ref">The Ref</a>.</p>
<p>Die Hards 1 and 2 are the best in the series.
Although they seemed wildly over the top when they were made (1988 and 1990),
they seem un­der­stat­ed compared to the thrillers that Hollywood pumps out now.</p>
<p>We saw Die Hard again tonight.
Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman shine in their breakout roles.
Willis exhibits the trademark cockiness that was already familiar
from <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlighting_(TV_series)">Moon­light­ing</a>,
but he's not as obnoxious as he often was in later roles.
Rickman gently nibbles the scenery as a terrorist turned master criminal.</p>

<p>After reading <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/08/15/ReviewLayerCakeBook.html">Layer Cake</a> earlier this week, I decided to rewatch the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_Cake_(film)">movie</a>.
The screenplay was written by J.J. Connolly, adapting his own novel.
Although the convoluted plot has been much simplified and somewhat rearranged,
it's still complex and tricky to follow.
Most of the humor is gone, as director Matthew Vaughn didn't want to make <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock,_Stock_and_Two_Smoking_Barrels">Lock Stock</a> III.
It's more of a straight thriller.
The Cockney is toned down, making it easier for a non-UK audience.
And Daniel Craig is somewhat older and calmer than the narrator of the book.</p>
