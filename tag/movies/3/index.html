<p>Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy),
a self-effacing, overweight, desk-bound CIA mission controller,
spends her days in a verminous CIA basement
talking into the earpiece of her glamorous field agent coun&shy;ter&shy;part.
When he's killed before her remote eyes and other field agents are com&shy;pro&shy;mised,
she goes into the field for the first time
and soon blossoms into a deadly agent.</p>
<p>I had never seen McCarthy in anything before and
I assumed that <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_(2015_film)">Spy</a> would be a dumb, gross-out comedy.
It was better than I feared
and genuinely funny at times.

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World">Jurassic World</a> is an un&shy;nec&shy;es&shy;sary retread of the Jurassic Park franchise.
New, scarier, smarter monster Imperator Furiosa¹
breaks out of its enclosure and wreaks havoc,
killing humans and dinosaurs for pleasure.
Plucky kids—or are they darn, meddling kids?—aided by unlikely romantic couple—<em>and</em> by ve&shy;loci&shy;rap&shy;tors and a T. Rex—manage to save the day.
Meanwhile, greedy human villains plan to profit off the mess
but get eaten before the end to audience applause.
Chris Pratt delivers scruffy heroics
while Bryce Dallas Howard runs around the entire movie
in ridiculous heels without breaking either an ankle or a heel.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Man_(film)">Ant-Man</a> is a light&shy;weight but appealing entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Decades ago, Hank Pym discovered the Pym Particle and invented the Ant-Man suit,
which allowed him to shrink to the size of an ant.
He buries the technology, believing it's too dangerous.
Now his former protégé Darren Cross is close
to perfecting the Yel&shy;low&shy;jack&shy;et shrinking suit and selling it to Hydra.
Pym and his daughter Hope recruit Scott Lang,
a former burglar, to don the Ant-Man suit to stop Cross.</p>
<p>Much of the movie is played for laughs.
Unlike <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/03/05/ReviewDeadpool.html">Deadpool</a>, these are PG-13 laughs.

notably in <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/05/20/ReviewAvengersAgeOfUltron.html">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a>.
Tony Stark (Iron Man) is feeling guilty about the deaths they've caused

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_from_U.N.C.L.E._(film)">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</a> is a moderately en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing action comedy
set in the cold war,
pos&shy;tu&shy;lat&shy;ing a somewhat unlikely alliance
between CIA agent Napoleon Solo and KGB operative Ilya Kuryakin,
who team up to prevent a nuclear weapon falling into ex-Nazi hands.
It's also the wholly un&shy;nec&shy;es&shy;sary remake of the classic 1960s TV show.</p>
<p>There's decent chemistry between the three stars,
Henry Cavill (Solo), Armie Hammer (Kuryakin), and Alicia Vikander (sci&shy;en&shy;tist's daughter),
and the glamorous early 1960s are lovingly recreated.
The plot, alas, is uninspired and unoriginal and falls rather flat.</p>
<p>Watchable.</p>

<p>We saw the “roadshow” edition of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hateful_Eight">The Hateful Eight</a> at the Cinerama,
projected in 70mm as Tarantino and God intended.
The eight pro&shy;tag&shy;o&shy;nists are all as hateful and violent
as you would expect given the title and the director.
Tarantino is incapable of making a film
without gratuitous violence and gore,
but neither can he make a film
without memorable characters who eviscerate with dialog.
He continues to deliver both.</p>
<p>During one long day, some years after the Civil War,
eight characters find themselves trapped by a blizzard in a remote inn.

it reminded me that I've been meaning to write
about the hit-or-miss nature of adapting books for the screen.</p>
<p>Books and video/film are different media,
with different con&shy;ven&shy;tions and needs.
Often the most-loved elements of a book are lost
when it's adapted for television or film,
upsetting fans.</p>
<p>As J.K. Rowling wrote about one of the Harry Potter movies:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;It is simply impossible to in&shy;cor&shy;po&shy;rate every one of my storylines
into a film that has to be kept under four hours long.
Obviously films have re&shy;stric&shy;tions
– novels do not have con&shy;straints of time and budget;

Whit (Hank Azaria) is well off, handsome, and very fit.
