    <p>I sat in a deserted coffee shop this afternoon with Emma,
as much of Seattle was watching the playoff game
of the Seattle Seahawks against the Green Bay Packers.
Idly curious, I checked the score early in the fourth quarter
and found that the Packers were leading 19–7.
I was quite surprised later to find that the Seahawks had won 28–22,
sending themselves to the Super Bowl in Arizona in two weeks' time.
Apparently, it was a thrilling comeback late in the game.</p>
<p>I suppose that I'm happy for my football-loving friends,
though I'm inclined to “love the sinner but hate the sin”,
as I can't stand football.

<p>This year is the 24th an&shy;niver&shy;sary of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattleaidswalk.org/">Seattle AIDS Walk</a>.
A whole generation has passed since the Northwest AIDS Walk began.
AIDS used to be the un&shy;stop&shy;pable disease that killed much of
a generation of gay men.</p>
<p>AIDS is still a serious problem, but the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of an&shy;ti&shy;retro&shy;vi&shy;ral
drugs in the Nineties means that people with HIV
are living longer, healthier lives than before.
More than 1.5 million Americans are now living with HIV/AIDS:
9,000 of them in King County.
40,000 people are infected every year,
and most new infections are among African-Americans.
The U.S. is getting off relatively lightly:
about one-quarter of the adults in southern Africa have HIV!</p>

<p>It's shocking how few times I've crossed the Cascades into Eastern Washington
in the seventeen years that I've lived in Seattle.
We go up or down the I-5 corridor, usually heading for Portland or Vancouver,
or we cross Puget Sound to the Olympic Peninsula.
But we never go more than about 30 miles inland.</p>
<p>We needed a break and we wanted to celebrate our <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/11/07/12thAnniversary.html">12th an&shy;niver&shy;sary</a>.
For once, we decided to head over to Wash&shy;ing&shy;ton's wine country.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tricitieswinefestival.com/">Tri-Cities Wine Festival</a> was being held in Kennewick today,
so that was our des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion.</p>

Actually, the weather was so wet this morning that we cooked and ate inside.</p>
<p>I am happy to report that thanks to the generosity of my sponsors,
I have raised $982 of my original goal of $1000.
With three weeks left until the walk,
I am predicting success in reaching my goal.</p>

<p>On the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.firstthursdayseattle.com/">First Thursday</a> of every month,
there's an Art Walk around Seattle's Pioneer Square.
All the art galleries stay open late
and thousands of people wander around looking at the art.</p>
<p>It's a shame then that in the four years that I've worked in Pioneer Square,
I've only Art Walked a handful of times.
Maura and Joseph joined us on Thursday
and we spent a pleasant couple of hours talking and wandering around,
mostly through the Tashiro-Kaplan building.
Muhsin was supposed to come too, but couldn't find parking
as the Seahawks played a pre-season game.</p>
<p>There are other First Thursday events:
many of the museums are free after 5pm.

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://chuckanutdrive.com/">Chuckanut Drive</a> is one of Washington State's best yet least-known scenic drives.
Take I-5 north from Seattle for 70 miles.
Just past Burlington, exit on to state route&nbsp;11.
The highway heads northwest towards the coast
across the fertile floodplain of the Skagit valley.
For nine miles, you drive past farms and fields.
Then the road rises at the coast, changing character instantly.</p>
<p>Now you're driving along the rocky, forested shoulder of the Chuckanut mountains.
One hundred feet below as you drive along the twisty, shady road,
you can catch glimpses of the waters of Samish Bay through the trees.
If you look closely, you may see the train tracks,

<p>I rode Seattle's new Light Rail system for the first time yesterday morning.
I walked to the new Beacon Hill station.
It took me just over 20&nbsp;minutes at a brisk pace,
so I'm not likely to walk there often.
I could have taken the 60&nbsp;bus to the station,
but it only runs every 30&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<p>When I got to the Beacon Hill station,
I couldn't figure out if my book of $2.00&nbsp;tickets
for Metro bus tickets were valid on the train or not.
The first three workers I asked didn't know either.
The cop I asked said “yes”, so I took the elevator 167&nbsp;feet down to the platform
and rode the train <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/08/14/LightRail.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

to see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.greenstage.org/2009/comedyoferrors">Greenstage</a>'s production of Shake&shy;speare's <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/06/24/ShakespeareInTheParkComedyOfErrors.html">Comedy of Errors</a>
at the Seward Park Am&shy;phithe&shy;ater.
Six of us braved the rain last night,
ate our picnic, and enjoyed an hour and a half of ribald slapstick.</p>
<p>Almost all of the cast cross-dressed.
The main male parts, the two sets of identical twin brothers, were played by women,
The wife, her sister, and the courtesan were played by ugly men
in the best <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantomime_dame">panto dame</a> tradition.</p>
<p>The play, like so many of Shake&shy;speare's comedies,
requires an endless series of confused identities,
which could be cleared up in moments
