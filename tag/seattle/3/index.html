Eric was intrigued too when I showed him a photo later,
and we went back to in­ves­ti­gate yesterday.</p>
<p>They only opened a few weeks ago.
As yet, the menu is limited.
The Maximus is a pulled pork sandwich with a hot sauce,
while the Minimus has a tangy sauce.
They have a vegetarian sandwich, chips made from potatoes and vegetables,
and hibiscus and ginger lemonades.</p>
<p>I don't much care for barbecue as a rule.
The Minimus with a sprinkling of Beecher's cheese was good, but not out­stand­ing.
The pork was flavorful and not over­whelmed by the <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/06/19/MaximusMinimus.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

Twenty acres of hills and valleys in a Japanese style.</p>
<p>Emma and I met Lyndol down there this morning
and rambled through the garden for two hours.
It was a fine, overcast day, with tem­per­a­tures in the low 60s and occasional driz­zle—and a pleasant relief from the record heat of earlier this week.
I had visited there before:
it's at the far end of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/transportation/chiefsealthtrail.htm">Chief Sealth bicycle trail</a>.
Lyn had too, but it was Emma's first visit.</p>

<p>For many years, I ignored the freeway sign for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rhodygarden.org/">Rhodo­den­dron Garden</a>
at exit 143 on I-5.
Five or six years ago, I visited the Rhody Garden
and I've gone back every spring since.</p>
<p>It's worth visiting at any time of year,
but from March to May or June, it's in bloom.
Twenty-two acres of rhodo­den­drons, azaleas, ferns, and other flowers,
near the Wey­er­hauser head­quar­ters in Federal Way, Washington.
There's a bonsai garden next door—un­for­tu­nate­ly now closed to the public.
As you stroll along the shaded hilly paths,
you can almost make believe that the constant traffic noise
from the nearby freeway is running water.</p>

<p>I took today off and headed north to the Skagit Valley with Emma and Lyndol
to see the tulips.
It was a glorious spring day,
sunny, not too warm, a light breeze.
The tulip fields were busy for a weekday;
they're completely overrun at the weekends.</p>
<p>We wandered around <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tuliptown.com/">Tulip Town</a> for an hour,
had lunch in La Conner,
and headed back to Seattle via Camano Island.</p>
<p>We had intended to take <a class="reference external" href="http://www.byways.org/explore/byways/2579/stories/67281">Chuckanut Drive</a> up to Fairhaven,
but Emma wasn't feeling well.
Some other time.
Chuckanut Drive is pretty year round;
the tulips are good only for another couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Our neigh­bor­hood was built in spurts.
The brick Tudors, like ours, were built in the 1930s.
The houses adjoining mine were built in the years after World War II.</p>
<p>There's a house for sale a few doors down that's very like ours.
We snooped around on Sunday during the open house.</p>
<p>Our house was built in 1931; the other, the year before.
Ours is slightly deeper, but the floor plans are very similar.
Theirs has no eye­catch­ing yellow brick trim.
Our kitchen was remodeled in the sixties, taking over part of the next room.
Theirs never was and it's tiny.
Our basement is half finished and

<p>I mentioned <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/17/Closing39Route.html">recently</a> that the #39 route is closing,
which would leave me without a direct connection to downtown Seattle.
The new #50 route would run along 15th Ave S, two blocks from my house,
to the Lander St Light Rail station in SoDo.</p>
<p>We attended the Metro Open House at the Jefferson Community Center this evening.</p>
<p>My concerns are slightly assuaged.
The new #50 should run every 15 minutes and run until about 11pm.
That's better than the #39 which runs every 30 minutes until 7pm,
then hourly until 9pm.</p>
<p>In addition, the #60, which also travels along 15th and
goes past the Beacon Hill Light Rail station,
would run <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/01/28/MetroOpenHouse.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
