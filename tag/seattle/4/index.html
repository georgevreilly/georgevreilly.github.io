<p>Seattle's Metro Transit is <a class="reference external" href="http://transit.metrokc.gov/up/sc/plans/2009/012009-sesea.html">changing</a> a number of routes in South Seattle.
They're proposing to close the #39.</p>

<p>I live two blocks from the busstop at 15th and S. Nevada,
served by routes #39, #60, and #36.
Metro is proposing to close the one really useful route,
the #39 which takes me to work in Pioneer Square.
The #60 gets me to 12th and S. Jackson,
nearly a mile from work.
The #36 only runs down 15th in the evenings;
otherwise it runs through Jefferson Park, half a mile away.</p>
<p>The new #50 route will be a poor re­place­ment,

<p>I tried to take the bus into work today, but no bus showed.
I later learned that the #39 had been “tem­porar­i­ly suspended”.
Emma drove into downtown Seattle, getting off at the James St. exit.
James is steep and it was closed to traffic.
She let me out at 7th and James and
I walked down to the Smith Tower.</p>
<p>Other people were <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/392969_bus20.html">not so lucky</a> on the steeper streets,
as you can see in the photo of a bus hanging over the interstate.</p>

<p>It snowed in Seattle yesterday.
We drove over to Sammamish last night to my CEO's house
for the Holiday Party.
The snow wasn't sticking to the roads,
so although visibility wasn't great,
getting there and back was not difficult.</p>
<p>It was cold today and colder tonight.
I saw only a light dusting of snow fall today,
but the snow that was melting earlier has refrozen.</p>
<p>We had to go out this evening,
over to Burien to see Frank.
The main roads were fine,
but we had a slightly alarming descent
on a hill near us as we headed over there.
Coming home, we had a couple of unpleasant minutes
trying to get up a hill <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/15/IcyRoads.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>This year is the 22nd an­niver­sary of the Northwest AIDS Walk.
A whole generation has passed.
Twenty years ago, AIDS was a gay man's disease and a death sentence.
The Reagan ad­min­is­tra­tion was just beginning to
ac­knowl­edge the existence of AIDS,
half a decade after it had first been recognized and
thousands had died.</p>
<p>AIDS is still a serious problem, but the de­vel­op­ment of an­ti­retro­vi­ral
drugs a decade ago means that people with HIV
are living longer, healthier lives than before.
More than 1.5 million Americans are now living with HIV/AIDS:
9,000 of them in King County.
40,000 people are infected every year,
and most new infections are among African-Americans.
