<p>In last week's newsletter from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishclub.org/">Irish Heritage Club</a>,
I read about a survey of Irish-born residents of Washington state.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/02/05/SurveyOfIrishbornImmigrantsInWashingtonAndBritishColumbia.html/mailto:SEATTLE-NEWS@IRISHCLUB.ORG">SEATTLE-NEWS@IRISH­CLUB.ORG</a>, FRIDAY, JANUARY 26, 2007, PART-1</p>
<p>IRISH SURVEY - Irish-born residents of Washington State are being asked to
complete a 32-question survey in connection with a PhD. research project
sponsored by Seattle's Irish Im­mi­gra­tion Support Group. The goal is to take
a snapshot of Irish-born people living in the Seattle area who left Ireland
in the 1900s, mostly those who left Ireland after WW-II. If you or someone
you know is willing to par­tic­i­pate, please contact Melissa at 206-229-8512

<p>As I mentioned last month,
I par­tic­i­pat­ed in this year's AIDS Walk on Saturday.</p>
<p>I raised over <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lifelongevents.org/site/TR?px=1013411&amp;pg=personal&amp;fr_id=1080">$1300 online</a>,
handily exceeding my goal of $1,000.
I also raised another $300 in cash and checks at the fundrais­ing barbecue
that we threw on September 1st.</p>
<p>I've lost count, but I believe that in the last 15 years, I've raised about
$10,000 for charity. Most of it has been for the Northwest AIDS Walk.
The last few years that I was at Microsoft,
I raised $2,000-$3,000 each year, thanks to the power of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/citizenship/giving/programs/employee.asp">Microsoft matching</a>,
which doubled the amount of money that I raised.
I've also raised money two years running for

    <p>I'm a lot happier in my U.S. con­gress­man, Jim McDermott, than I am in my
senators, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell. (Especially Cantwell.)</p>
<p>Jim has been a strong pro­gres­sive voice in Congress for years.
His early opposition to the Iraq War led to him being dubbed 'Baghdad Jim'
by infuriated Re­pub­li­cans. He was one of the first national politi­cians
to support Howard Dean's bid for the presidency. He had a big role in
Fahrenheit 9/11. And he reads the role of Leopold Bloom for the

    <p>I <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/08/26/AIDSWalk2005.html">mentioned recently</a> that I would be walking in this year's AIDS Walk.
And so I did.</p>
<p>After months of dry, sunny weather in Seattle, I have grown un­ac­cus­tomed to rain.
It was an unpleasant morning and an unpleasant shock.
The skies opened and I stood in an endless line waiting to register.
I raised $1180, which entitled me to huddle in the VIP tent, as the rain continued.
The rain finally let up about halfway along the route, as we debouched onto Broadway.</p>
<p>Thanks to my fellow Team BiNet Seattle fundrais­ers, Emily and Meghan,
who raised a few hundred more between them.
Double thanks to Emily for giving <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/14/AIDSWalkRainHappens.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>My good friend Frank Maloney turned 60 the other day.
A few months ago, he invited Emma and me to join him
and his partner, Lyndol,
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theherbfarm.com">The Herbfarm</a>.
The Herbfarm is one of the very best restau­rants in the Seattle area.
Certainly one of the most expensive.</p>

<p>Frank brought us to The Herbfarm, but not at his own expense.
One of Frank's college roommates was Ron Zimmerman,
the owner of The Herbfarm,
and Ron had invited Frank to bring Lyndol and two guests
over for his 60th birthday.
Ron semi-seriously credits Frank with in­tro­duc­ing him to good wine,
when Frank was a sommelier in the Seventies.</p>

<p>We had a marvelous time.
