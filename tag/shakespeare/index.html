<p>I'm familiar with most of Shake­speare's plays,
but not only had I never seen <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymbeline">Cymbeline</a> before today,
I knew nothing about it.
While the per­for­mance we saw was enjoyable,
I began to see why it's one of the lesser-known plays.
It's one of Shake­speare's later, minor comedies,
with such familiar elements as
a cross­dress­ing heroine,
confused and separated lovers,
false ac­cu­sa­tions of infidelity,
stolen princes,
a knavish villain who gets his come­up­pance,
and a loyal servant.
It's easy to see a tired Shake­speare
trotting out yet another comedy to amuse the groundlings.</p>

<p>Quick, readable intro to Shake­speare's life and plays,
setting him in the context of the religious and political turmoils
of the late Eliz­a­bethan and early Jacobean eras.
You can't do justice to Shake­speare in an hour, of course,
Most useful if you didn't already know anything about him or his work.</p>

<p>I saw Green­stage's production of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.greenstage.org/2009/titus">Titus Andronicus</a> on Sunday night.
Normally, this is Shake­speare's bloodiest tragedy,
but Greenstage chose to play it as a dark comedy.
It's still bloody, extremely bloody, blood everywhere,
spurting from severed wrists,
spraying from cut throats,
shooting over the stage
(and some of the audience).</p>
<p>The first twenty minutes were very confusing.
The actors spoke their lines very quickly and I had a hard time
tuning in to what they were saying and what was happening.
Then either they slowed down or I tuned in,
but it started making sense,
inasmuch as Titus Andronicus can ever make sense.</p>
<p>I've seen Greenstage do comedies and straight tragedies.
Here they hammed it <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/10/28/TitusAndronicus.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I mentioned three weeks ago that I was putting together a group of people
to see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.greenstage.org/2009/comedyoferrors">Greenstage</a>'s production of Shake­speare's <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/06/24/ShakespeareInTheParkComedyOfErrors.html">Comedy of Errors</a>
at the Seward Park Am­phithe­ater.
Six of us braved the rain last night,
ate our picnic, and enjoyed an hour and a half of ribald slapstick.</p>
<p>Almost all of the cast cross-dressed.
The main male parts, the two sets of identical twin brothers, were played by women,
The wife, her sister, and the courtesan were played by ugly men
in the best <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantomime_dame">panto dame</a> tradition.</p>
<p>The play, like so many of Shake­speare's comedies,
requires an endless series of confused identities,
which could be cleared up in moments
if only <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/07/14/ComedyOfErrors.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Greenstage continue their Shake­speare in the Park this year
with per­for­mances of King John and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.greenstage.org/2009/comedyoferrors">Comedy of Errors</a>
at a number of Seattle-area parks over the summer.
Emma and I enjoyed their Twelfth Night at Seward Park last year.
Best of all, it's free!</p>
<p>The play starts at 7:00pm.
Come at 5:00 and have a picnic with us near the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/trails_detail.asp?id=428">Am­phithe­ater</a>.
Bring food that's ready to eat—the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pccnaturalmarkets.com/locations/sp.html">Seward Park PCC</a> is less than a mile away.
There's some seating but you might want to bring your own chairs.</p>

<p>I've slowly been working my way through <a class="reference external" href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/product/info.jsp?isbn=0140249133">Shake­speare's Kings</a> (rec­om­mend­ed),
so when I realized that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattleshakespeare.org/2008-2009/henry/index.asp">Henry IV</a> was playing at the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattleshakespeare.org/">Seattle Shake­speare Company</a>, I decided to go.
It's an adaptation of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV,_Part_1">Henry IV, Part 1</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV,_Part_2">Part 2</a>.</p>
<p>Henry IV usurped the crown from his cousin <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_II_of_England">Richard II</a>.
The crown sits uneasily upon his head, rebellion is brewing,
and his heir, Prince Hal (the future <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_V_of_England">Henry V</a>),
is a wastrel who carouses with thieves like the fat rogue <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falstaff">Falstaff</a>.
Hal, Falstaff, Henry IV, and Harry Hotspur (the rebel leader)
are the central characters in this play.
Hal's dis­so­lu­tion is compared un­fa­vor­ably to Hotspur's chivalry.

<p>My opera education continues. Tonight, we saw
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattleopera.org/operas/2005-2006/macbeth/">Seattle Opera's production of Verdi's MacBeth</a>.</p>
<p>I used to be very familiar with
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth">Shake­speare's MacBeth</a>,
having studied it for two years in prepa­ra­tion for the
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_Certificate">Leaving Cer­tifi­cate</a>
(the major ex­am­i­na­tion at the end of Irish secondary school;
ef­fec­tive­ly the entrance exam for university).</p>
<p>Verdi's <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth_%28opera%29">opera of MacBeth</a>
truncates Shake­speare's plot, con­cen­trat­ing on the tragic flaw of the
MacBeths. Their shared ambition, feeding off each other, both impels them
to power, and leads to their ultimate downfall. The opera was written
during the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_unification">Risorg­i­men­to</a>,
when Italy was trying to break away from the Austrian empire, and doubles
as a thinly veiled appeal to Italian patriotism.</p>
