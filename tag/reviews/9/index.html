Martin Beck, recovering from being shot,
in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gates the death of a man,
who has been found shot in a locked room with no gun.
Meanwhile, some of his former colleagues,
now serving on a special task force,
are trying to deal with an epidemic of bank robberies.
The latter is a comedy of errors, with the police con&shy;sis&shy;tent&shy;ly messing up.</p>
<p>The authors are severely critical of the growth of Swedish police powers
in the decade before this book was written.

<p>A student is found murdered on the grounds of Trinity College Dublin.
Sergeant Matt Minogue, newly back on duty after serious injuries,
in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gates and eventually finds links to the violence
then roiling Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>A slow-moving but thoughtful police procedural.
Minogue may be trau&shy;ma&shy;tized by earlier injuries,
but he is not the cynical, hard-drinking policeman so typical of fiction,
but rather a happily married father with a nose for the truth.</p>

<p>Six people arrange to meet in Venice for Carnival,
masked and costumed as their true selves.
Not knowing how the others are costumed,
each makes very dif&shy;fer&shy;en&shy;t—and wrong—as&shy;sump&shy;tions.
Brian, husband of Sally and lover of Jean-Pierre, is found dead.
Surely one of the group is the killer.
An effete local, Count Michele Zanon, takes an interest in the affair.</p>
<p>A strange novel whose plot hinges on
mis&shy;com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion, mistaken identities, and incorrect as&shy;sump&shy;tions,
as the seven pro&shy;tag&shy;o&shy;nists rush around Venice,
seeking or hiding from each other.</p>

<p>We received an un&shy;so&shy;licit&shy;ed copy of this ridiculous book in the mail.
It drones on and on about Satan and his plans,
bashing both Catholics and Protes&shy;tants.
Apparently, ‘Sunday worship is “the mark of the beast!”’.
Who knew? Who cares.</p>
<p>I assumed that it's from the Seventh Day Adventists,
though I couldn't confirm that from skimming it.
However, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.catholic.com/tracts/seventh-day-adventism">Catholic Answers</a> confirms my guess.</p>
<p>Best avoided, especially on Sundays.</p>

<p>Peter and Pauli Winter are brothers,
born to a wealthy German in&shy;dus&shy;tri&shy;al&shy;ist and his American wife
at the end of the nineteenth century.
They proudly serve as young officers in the German military in the Great War,
live through the tumultuous 1920s in Berlin,
but go in very different directions,
and end up on opposite sides in World War II.
Peter, the elder, is a brilliant lawyer and talented pianist.
Pauli, loyal but less talented,
bonds with other embittered veterans of the First War,
serves in the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freikorps">Freikorps</a>,

Now she's the prime witness to a murder.
Phelan Tierney, a former lawyer, has taken her under his wing,

<p>Three people are nearly all that's left of the elite “Meshed” caste.
They stay one step aside of the hunters
and live off the proceeds from making and selling the highly addictive “Staze”.
They flee to a long-abandoned planet and discover a new lifeform,
which takes over in both meatspace and the shared virtual reality,
infecting the dreams of the Staze-addicted.</p>
<p>While there were some in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing ideas in this book,
I didn't enjoy it very much.</p>
