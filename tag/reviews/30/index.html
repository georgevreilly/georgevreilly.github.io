<p>Kvothe—the infamous, legendary Kvothe—has been living under an assumed name
when the Chronicler tracks him down and asks him for his life story.
Kvothe relates the story of his early years:
his precocious talents for music and arcanism (magic);
the happy childhood that ends
when his parents and their troupe are murdered by an ancient evil;
his years as a feral street child;
and his early entrance into the University to study the Arcanum,
where his brilliance makes him a star and his reck­less­ness brings him much <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/07/24/ReviewTheNameOfTheWind.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Le Carré's very first novel,
<em>Call for the Dead</em> introduces his most famous character, George Smiley.
After a harmonious meeting with Smiley to review his security clearance,
Samuel Fennan goes home, writes a letter com­plain­ing of har­rass­ment,
and commits suicide.
But little things don't add up and Smiley starts in­ves­ti­gat­ing,
only to be nearly murdered himself.</p>
<p>A strong debut, and amazingly short at 160 pages.
<em>Call</em> provides some background about Smiley's very bad war,
undercover in Nazi ter­ri­to­ries, and his rocky marriage.</p>

<p>For 13 months in 1933–34, John Dillinger robbed banks all over the Midwest,
leaving behind a legend and con­tribut­ing to the growth of the FBI.
Johnny Depp gives a charis­mat­ic per­for­mance of a ruthless and audacious killer,
who endeared himself to the public as
he liked to give money back to the customers of the banks he was robbing.
Christian Bale is the cold, efficient lead FBI agent,
in charge of a brutal and not very competent team,
little better than the men they chased.
Marion Cotillard is Dillinger's girlfriend
who he's willing to brave all to be with after <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/07/02/ReviewPublicEnemies.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

A shy little boy Carl Fredrick­sen meets the exuberant Ellie,
who also hero worships Charles Muntz, noted explorer of Paradise Falls.
They grow old together and Ellie dies
before they can achieve their lifelong dream of an adventure.
With nothing left to lose, Carl attaches 10,000 helium balloons to his house
and floats off to South America in search of Paradise Falls,
in­ad­ver­tent­ly taking Russell, a Wilderness Explorer, with him.</p>
