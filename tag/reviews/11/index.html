<p>The Coen Brothers' latest movie, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail,_Caesar!">Hail, Caesar!</a>, is a lot of fun.
I've been looking forward to it since the trailers showed up a few months ago.
It's a homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood,
an age where quirky talents like the Coens
could not have made Coen Brothers' movies.
We see song and dance numbers, syn&shy;chro&shy;nized swimming,
singing cowboys, and ballroom dramas.
Most of all, we see a big-budget swords-and-sandals epic,
whose star, Baird Whitlock, has been kidnapped by The Future,
a group of Communist screen&shy;writ&shy;ers,
and is being held for $100,000 ransom.
Eddie Mannix is the studio fixer who has to wrangle
the studio's stars and keep them out <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/02/25/ReviewHailCaesar.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>New Orleans, 1834.
Benjamin January is a free man of color
and a Paris-trained surgeon who must support himself as a musician.
His sister Olympe, a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Voodoo">voodooi&shy;enne</a>, and another woman, Célie,
are accused of murdering Célie's husband,
and Ben must save them from hanging.
As a pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al musician and a colored man,
Ben moves between the high society of the old French in&shy;hab&shy;i&shy;tants
and the new American merchants,
the poor white areas of town,
the many slaves,
and the small free black middle class.
Hambly adeptly explores slavery,

<p>A body has washed up in the canals of Venice,
that of an American soldier from the nearby US base at Vicenza.
Com&shy;mis&shy;sario Guido Brunetti doesn't believe that it's a mugging gone wrong,
especially when he sees the fear in the eyes
of the female army doctor who's sent to identify the body.
He digs and finds corruption among the rich and powerful, in a toxic coverup.</p>
<p>Brunetti is a decent and honorable family man,
whose sense of justice is undi&shy;min&shy;ished by working for

They disowned his Catholic mother decades ago when she married his Jewish father.
It turns out that her siblings are still un&shy;re&shy;pen&shy;tant bigots,
but he finds himself drawn to two of his cousins,
pretty young Catherine Callahan
and Brendan O'Malley, a poet whose brother Sean has just been murdered.
Cousin Benny finds himself drawn into in&shy;ternecine feuding between the IRA and the INLA,

as part of its <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cinerama.com/News/January-2015/Eight-Days-of-Oscar.aspx">Eight Days of Oscar</a>—<em>Fury Road</em> having being nominated for ten Oscars,
including Best Picture and Best Director.
I have no idea if it will win any awards from the Academy,
but it's no ordinary action movie.</p>
<p>Action there is aplenty,
a kinetic feast of racing cars and roaring maniacs
that rarely lets up.
Imperator Furiosa and Max flee across the desert,
taking Immortan Joe's five nubile wives to a better place.
They seek hope, Furiosa seeks redemption, and Max seeks mostly to survive.
Furiosa sets the plot in motion;
Max is a loner battered by fate,

<p>London, January 1381.
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Gaunt">John of Gaunt</a>'s regency is in trouble,
unrest abounds throughout the land,
and uprisings are being plotted.
Brother Athelstan and his friend the Coroner
are invited to a per&shy;for&shy;mance by Gaunt's players, the Straw Men,
at the Tower of London.
When a murder occurs during the play, Athelstan is required to in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gate.
Several more murders happen before he finds the culprit.</p>
<p>Doherty pulls off both an intricate plot and a satisfying historical novel.</p>

<p>The wife of a rich politician has been kidnapped by terrorists
who want to exchange her in nine days' time
for one of their number who's in prison.
Actor Bob Farran thinks he can im&shy;per&shy;son&shy;ate Tom Lacey well enough
that Sally Morland will be freed and he can earn the £250,000 reward.</p>
<p>We spend three quarters of the book preparing for the im&shy;per&shy;son&shy;ation,
which gives Farran time to do it well.
While the nine-day delay enabled the im&shy;per&shy;son&shy;ation,
it makes little sense for the terrorists to have asked for such a delay.
