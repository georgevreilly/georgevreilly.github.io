<p>An NSA analyst spots a suspicious cor&shy;re&shy;la&shy;tion between the NSA station chief in Ankara
and a crusading journalist, and she reports it to the director of the NSA.
The station chief promptly dies in a car crash
and the journalist is abducted by Syrian terrorists,
and she starts to worry.
As the ever-more au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;tar&shy;i&shy;an director goes further off the deep end,
her worry grows—with good reason.
And the director's hatchet man who is assigned to monitor her
un&shy;ex&shy;pect&shy;ed&shy;ly turns out to have human feelings.</p>

<p>Pinkerton agent Frederick Chase arrives at Re&shy;ichen&shy;bach Falls
just after Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty have plunged to their deaths.
With Inspector Athelney Jones of Scotland Yard—&shy;sure&shy;ly one of Holmes's most ardent stu&shy;dents—he travels to London on the trail of an American master criminal, Clarence Devereaux.
De&shy;v&shy;ereaux's gang is moving quickly and ruthlessly
to seize control of the vacuum left by Moriarty.
But not all is it appears and the American gang receive bloody setbacks.
Could Moriarty be alive after all?</p>

<p>A disparate group of necro&shy;mancer hunters and artists are trekking through the desert.
They're out of food and the artists must compete not to be eaten by the strongmen
by telling stories by the campfire.
It's the Canterbury Tales crossed with Scheherazade.
The narrator shows how he skillfully and shame&shy;less&shy;ly ma&shy;nip&shy;u&shy;lat&shy;ed the various parties.
His stories within stories sow doubt and dissension.
There's black humor and art criticism and enough suspense to keep you going,
once you get past the in&shy;ter&shy;minable beginning.</p>

Dennis left a pregnant Libby (Thandie Newton) at the altar five years ago.
Now he's an overweight security guard in a London lingerie shop
and she's found a new boyfriend who's everything that Dennis is not:
Whit (Hank Azaria) is well off, handsome, and very fit.
Somehow Dennis ends up promising to run in a marathon in three weeks' time
that Whit is also running in.
Much of the story revolves around his training,

<p>The Coen Brothers' latest movie, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail,_Caesar!">Hail, Caesar!</a>, is a lot of fun.
I've been looking forward to it since the trailers showed up a few months ago.
It's a homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood,
an age where quirky talents like the Coens
could not have made Coen Brothers' movies.
We see song and dance numbers, syn&shy;chro&shy;nized swimming,
singing cowboys, and ballroom dramas.
Most of all, we see a big-budget swords-and-sandals epic,
whose star, Baird Whitlock, has been kidnapped by The Future,
a group of Communist screen&shy;writ&shy;ers,
and is being held for $100,000 ransom.
Eddie Mannix is the studio fixer who has to wrangle
