<p>Bay Tanner is a young widow and aspiring private in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tor
from wealthy South Carolina stock.
When a hitherto unknown <a class="reference external" href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-shi5.htm">shirt-tail</a> cousin (fifth half cousin, specif&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly)
bursts into Bay's life, she brings havoc in her train.</p>
<p>As one of the characters says,
the plot sounds like a made-for-TV movie.
Still, Bay is a feisty heroine and
the background is not one that has been mined deeply.</p>

<p>We saw <em>The Seafarer</em> at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattlereptickets.org/Plays/0809/SF/">Seattle Rep</a> this afternoon.
Two brothers, Richard and Sharkey, share a house in north Dublin.
There's little love lost between them.
Richard, recently blinded, is con&shy;trol&shy;ling and wheedling.
Sharkey is trying to stay off the gargle
and it's not easy when Richard and his crony Ivan drink like fishes.</p>
<p>Sharkey's old rival, Nicky, arrives on Christmas Eve,
bringing a stranger with him, Mr. Lockhart.
They settle down to a game of poker
and Sharkey privately learns that he's met the stranger once before.
For Mr. Lockhart is the devil and he wants to collect the old <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/09/ReviewTheSeafarer.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>As promised <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/03/06/WhoWatchesTheWatchmen.html">yesterday</a>, we saw the initial midnight showing
of the <em>Watchmen</em> movie at the Pacific Science Center IMAX.
And, lo, the geeks came in their numbers
and they were greatly pleased.
Some were dressed as Rorschach,
one came as a smurf;
no, I lie, he was Dr. Manhattan.</p>
<p>I summarized the plot in my review of the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/02/22/ReviewWatchmenBook.html">book</a>.
That still holds: the movie was largely faithful to the book.
In many scenes, it was clear that the book had served as a storyboard.
Too faithful in some ways at 165 minutes long.
Some subplots were elim&shy;i&shy;nat&shy;ed;
no doubt they will resurface <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/06/ReviewWatchmenFilm.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I was Toast&shy;mas&shy;ter of the Day at this evening's meeting of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.FreelySpeaking.org/">Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters</a>.
My theme was software de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment and I wanted to give the non-developer audience
a taste for what it's like to write a program.
I talked about writing a simple Sudoku game.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read <em>Pro&shy;gram&shy;ming Sudoku</em> for background.
I bought this book for Emma after reading about it on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ProgrammingSudoku.aspx">Scott Hansel&shy;man's blog</a>.
It's targeted at beginning pro&shy;gram&shy;mers and
walks them through building a Sudoku game and solver.
I was hoping to get Emma more interested in pro&shy;gram&shy;ming—un&shy;suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly.

<p>In the 1850s, three anti-slavery families settled next to each other
in rural Kansas: the Grelliers, the Schapens, and the rich Fremantles.
Seven gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tions later, the last of the Fremantles is gone,
the Grelliers are pro&shy;gres&shy;sive farmers,
and the Schapens are bel&shy;liger&shy;ent fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal&shy;ists.
Gina Haring, a Wiccan lesbian from New York,
housesits the Fremantle mansion,
while she tries to pick up the pieces of her life.
In&shy;ad&shy;ver&shy;tent&shy;ly, she triggers a cascade of changes.
Most notably, the Grellier son, at odds with his anti-war mother,
enlists and is killed in Iraq,

Newly widowed, estranged from his sons,

Walt is a bitter, racist old bastard.</p>

The theft was to be the reluctant Thao's gang initiation.
The gang come by to punish Thao and Walt runs the “gooks” off his lawn at gunpoint.
The Hmong neighbors start bringing over food and flowers in gratitude.

<p>Liam Neeson is Bryan Mills, a former CIA “pre&shy;ven&shy;ter” who re&shy;luc&shy;tant&shy;ly
lets his teenaged daughter visit Paris.
Kim is abducted by an Albanian pros&shy;ti&shy;tu&shy;tion ring
and he sets out to rescue her.
Non-stop mayhem and action ensue.</p>
<p><em>Taken</em> works fairly ef&shy;fec&shy;tive&shy;ly as an action movie in the <em>Bourne</em> mode.
The plot moves fast enough that you don't have time to
reflect upon the gaping holes or
the improbable ef&shy;fec&shy;tive&shy;ness and in&shy;vin&shy;ci&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty of Mills.</p>
<p>Neeson carries the movie, convincing as the pissed-off hardass
who'll go to any lengths to find his daughter.</p>

<p>Another novel in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_universe">Dune</a> franchise.
<em>Paul of Dune</em> is an interquel,
largely taking place in the decade
between the events of <em>Dune</em> and of <em>Dune Messiah</em>.</p>
<p>Paul Atreides has become the Emperor of the known galaxy.
A vicious jihad has burst across the empire in his name.
His prescience tells him that it's absolutely necessary
so that mankind can break out of the course that leads to stagnation and de&shy;struc&shy;tion.
But billions have died and many more are yet to die.
He is feared and hated.
