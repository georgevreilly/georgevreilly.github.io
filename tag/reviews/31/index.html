<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)">Up</a> is another gem from Pixar.
A shy little boy Carl Fredrick&shy;sen meets the exuberant Ellie,
who also hero worships Charles Muntz, noted explorer of Paradise Falls.
They grow old together and Ellie dies
before they can achieve their lifelong dream of an adventure.
With nothing left to lose, Carl attaches 10,000 helium balloons to his house
and floats off to South America in search of Paradise Falls,
in&shy;ad&shy;ver&shy;tent&shy;ly taking Russell, a Wilderness Explorer, with him.</p>
<p>The movie appealed just as much to the kids at our showing as the adults.
The sto&shy;ry&shy;telling is first rate, combining humor, adventure, love, <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/06/21/ReviewUp.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Andy Boychuk has just become the leader of the opposition party in Saskatchewan
when he is murdered.
His advisor, Joanne Kilbourn, sees him drink the poison.
Her own husband was sense&shy;less&shy;ly murdered a few years earlier,
and Andy was not only her boss but an old friend, so it's difficult for her.
When she decides to write a biography of Andy
and learns unexpected things about him,
her health mys&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;ous&shy;ly begins to fail.</p>

His ashes are delivered to his cousin Horace, also a retired spy,

Then he learns that Paul is on the trail of Ibn Awad,

Southmarch is under siege by the fairy army

Briony is on the run, fleeing for her life.
Her twin, Barrick, is lost, mentally and physically, behind the fairy lines.

<p><em>Ob&shy;jec&shy;ti&shy;fied</em> is a doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary about industrial design
and the man&shy;u&shy;fac&shy;tured objects that litter our lives.
In interviews with some leading designers,
Hustwit brings forth such topics as
our emotional attachment to those objects;
the ephemer&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ty and planned ob&shy;soles&shy;ence of most of this “stuff”;
the approaches of different designers;
designing the man&shy;u&shy;fac&shy;tur&shy;ing process as well as the object;
how good design often almost dis&shy;ap&shy;pears;
sus&shy;tain&shy;abil&shy;i&shy;ty, when most objects end up in landfill;
in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tion and interface design;
etc.</p>
<p>The danger with such a broad survey
is that you can't do justice to anything.
I was left wanting to know more about many of the topics.

The CDF remake him and his peers into su&shy;per&shy;sol&shy;diers

It's an alien-eat-alien multiverse (sometimes literally)

<p>A paedophile chained up an eight-year-old boy's parents,
then took the boy and killed him.
DI Jack Caffery finds the case par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly stressful:
his brother was abducted and never found when they were boys.
His girlfriend is falling apart too.</p>
<p>Part thriller, part psy&shy;cho&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal study, part police procedural.
Hayder ratchets up the tension
as the internal and external pressures on Caffery grow.</p>
<p>Rec&shy;om&shy;mend&shy;ed.</p>
