<p>In the summer of 1939,
Richard and Frances Myles are approached at their Oxford college
to do a simple-sounding spy-related task during their upcoming European vacation.
One thing leads to another until eventually
these amateur spies are on the run in the Tyrol.
MacInnes had traveled in Europe in the 1930s
and brings a strong sense of place to the locations she describes,
as well as a strong dislike of the to&shy;tal&shy;i&shy;tar&shy;i&shy;an&shy;ism that the Germans had fallen into.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4179040/">De Reünie</a> is a Dutch film starring Thekla Reuten as Sabine,
a woman who is disturbed by her half memories
of her final year of secondary school some twenty years ago,
when her girlfriend Isabel dis&shy;ap&shy;peared without trace.
The arrival of Olaf—once a classmate, still a jerk—at her workplace triggers more memories
as they are drawn together.
Slowly, very slowly, through extended flashbacks,
we learn more about that fateful spring in a small coastal town
as Sabine and Isabel fell out of love.

<p>I'm familiar with most of Shake&shy;speare's plays,
but not only had I never seen <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymbeline">Cymbeline</a> before today,
I knew nothing about it.
While the per&shy;for&shy;mance we saw was enjoyable,
I began to see why it's one of the lesser-known plays.
It's one of Shake&shy;speare's later, minor comedies,
with such familiar elements as
a cross&shy;dress&shy;ing heroine,
confused and separated lovers,
false ac&shy;cu&shy;sa&shy;tions of infidelity,
stolen princes,
a knavish villain who gets his come&shy;up&shy;pance,
and a loyal servant.
It's easy to see a tired Shake&shy;speare
trotting out yet another comedy to amuse the groundlings.</p>

<p>Three bomb disposal techs in Iraq are the subject of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hurt_Locker">The Hurt Locker</a>:
Sgt James (Jeremy Renner), Sgt Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Spec Eldridge (Brian Geraghty).
James has grown addicted to war and he is reckless and cavalier about disarming bombs,
while Sanborn is in&shy;creas&shy;ing&shy;ly angry at James' en&shy;dan&shy;ger&shy;ment of them all
and Eldridge grows ever more terrified and fatalistic.
<em>The Hurt Locker</em> is a gritty and visceral war film.
We have no idea what's going to happen next
and anyone could be blown up or shot at any time.

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters_(2016_film)">Ghost&shy;busters</a> remake is a light&shy;weight but enjoyable summer comedy and a lot of fun.
Four women, mostly dis&shy;cred&shy;it&shy;ed scientists, fight an increasing number of paranormal incursions
and kick some as&shy;s—with&shy;out wearing skintight clothing or being adjuncts to male leads.
Internet trolls may be outraged but the non-tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al casting works.
Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones are funny and jell together.
And Chris Hemsworth as the hunky but dim re&shy;cep&shy;tion&shy;ist is an amusing bit of reverse casting,
while Kate McKinnon seems to have become a <a class="reference external" href="http://the-orbit.net/teacosy/2016/07/21/jillian-holtzmann-is-queer-as-a-salty-parabola-and-not-here-for-the-straight-people/">queer icon</a> overnight.</p>

<p>1018AD. King Cnut of Denmark (aka <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnut_the_Great">Canute</a>) has recently conquered England,
and now must broker peace between the Saxons and the Danes at Oxford.
Also in Oxford are Winston, a talented il&shy;lu&shy;mi&shy;na&shy;tor of man&shy;u&shy;scripts,
and Halfdan, a roguish half-Danish half-Saxon landless noble.
A prominent Saxon has been murdered and Cnut commands Winston and Halfdan to in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gate.</p>
<p>While the mystery was reasonably while done,
I found the anachro&shy;nis&shy;tic speech patterns quite jarring.
The book is translated from Danish;
I presume this is also true in the original.</p>

<p>Abigail has gone missing from creepy Blackwater Farm days before her tenth birthday.
Her twin Olivia has been mute ever since.
Their strange mother is not helping matters and the father is acting oddly too.
DC Jennifer Knight, who belongs to a secret psychic police task force,
is the family liaison officer.
She must convince Olivia to break her silence and reveal what she knows
before time runs out for Abigail.</p>
<p>This was a reasonably good thriller that I think would have been better
without the su&shy;per&shy;nat&shy;ur&shy;al elements.</p>

<p>Millenia ago, the Dark Elves almost destroyed the Nine Realms
with their ultimate weapon known as the Aether.
Now the Con&shy;ver&shy;gence, when the Nine Realms briefly align, is imminent
and the surviving Dark Elves have returned to reclaim the Aether.
Meanwhile on Midgard (Earth),
as&shy;tro&shy;physi&shy;cist Jane Foster discovers portals linking the realms,
whereupon she in&shy;ad&shy;ver&shy;tent&shy;ly becomes the host of the Aether.
Thor rescues his lover and brings her to Asgard.
Many battles ensue across the Nine Realms
as Thor prevents the Elves from invoking the Aether at the Con&shy;ver&shy;gence.</p>
