<p>I've been waiting longer than most for George R.R. Martin
to finish the <em>A Song of Fire and Ice</em> series:
I read the first book when it was <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/11/20/AFeastForCrows.html">newly published in paperback</a> in 1997.
<em>Fire and Blood</em> is a new addition to the series,
but it is a prequel and does not advance the plot at all.
This book is a history of the first half of the
three hun&shy;dred–year reign of the Targaryen dynasty,
the dragon riders who conquered Westeros
with their fire&shy;breath&shy;ing dragons.

<p>Two years ago, just after the death of Richard Adams,
I reread the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2017/01/01/ReviewWatershipDown.html">book</a> of <em>Watership Down</em>
for the first time in many years,
having originally discovered it when it was new
in the mid-1970s.
There's a beautiful new adaptation,
an animated <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down_(miniseries)">miniseries</a> made by the BBC and Netflix.</p>
<p>This adaptation is largely faithful to the original book:
The brave young rabbits striking out on their own
before their home warren is destroyed;
creating a new warren on Watership Down;
the war with the to&shy;tal&shy;i&shy;tar&shy;i&shy;an warren of Efrafa;
the peaceful aftermath.
One short&shy;com&shy;ing is that

<p>Before I begin to describe <em>The Heart's Invisible Furies</em>
with abundant spoilers, let me say two things.
Despite what I describe below, the book is very funny,
as Cyril recounts his frequent fuckups.
You would never know,
from reading the back cover or the excerpted reviews inside,
that Cyril is gay.
Yet Cyril's sexuality is the central theme of the book.
I can only assume that this is a marketing decision,
with which I strongly disagree.</p>

<p>A jealous husband engages
a private detective-cum-killer for hire (Simon Pegg) to follow his wife.
Upon proof of her infidelity, he orders a hit,
which triggers a comedy of errors and double crosses,
which ultimately leaves most of the cast dead at each other's hands.</p>
<p>There's not much to like about this Australian noirish comedy.
It's bloody but not that funny.
The characters are thinly drawn and unengaging.
They're a far cry from Taran&shy;ti&shy;no's gonzo mo&shy;tor&shy;mouths
or the Coen Brother's quirky killers.</p>

Kenzie and Gennaro don't want the case—the odds of finding Amanda alive and unharmed are low.
They'll go through hell before they succeed.</p>
