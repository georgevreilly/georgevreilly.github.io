<p>Tom Mus&shy;grave—&shy;Mas&shy;ter of Defence and Master of Logic, friend to Will Shake&shy;speare—is present at the very first per&shy;for&shy;mance of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>
when the actor playing Mercutio is somehow fatally stabbed
with an envenomed rapier during an on-stage duel.
He uncovers perfidy and poisonings
which stretches back for years and
rises into the highest halls of the land.</p>
<p>Tonkin has not only created a brilliant and dangerous pro&shy;tag&shy;o&shy;nist,
he has metic&shy;u&shy;lous&shy;ly recreated Eliz&shy;a&shy;bethan London,
a city that is a stew of ambition, peril, and intrigue.</p>

<p>Jet Butler lives on an isolated mesa in New Mexico.
One of her few friends is a suspect in a murder.
Cordelia Morgan, an outsider,
who turns out to be far more than she seems,
is also interested in the murder,
which seems to be somehow tied up in the sale of water rights.</p>
<p>This never quite gelled for me.
Despite the author's flair for de&shy;scrip&shy;tion,
I found the plot confusing and I was not engaged with the two pro&shy;tag&shy;o&shy;nists.</p>

<p>Conor Lalor's family life is falling apart.
His parents are breaking up and they're broke,
there not being much work in Dublin in 1985.

They are being filmed by a doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary crew in the months running up

<p>Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy),

spends her days in a verminous CIA basement
talking into the earpiece of her glamorous field agent coun&shy;ter&shy;part.
When he's killed before her remote eyes and other field agents are com&shy;pro&shy;mised,
she goes into the field for the first time
and soon blossoms into a deadly agent.</p>
<p>I had never seen McCarthy in anything before and
I assumed that <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_(2015_film)">Spy</a> would be a dumb, gross-out comedy.

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World">Jurassic World</a> is an un&shy;nec&shy;es&shy;sary retread of the Jurassic Park franchise.
New, scarier, smarter monster Imperator Furiosa¹
breaks out of its enclosure and wreaks havoc,
killing humans and dinosaurs for pleasure.
Plucky kids—or are they darn, meddling kids?—aided by unlikely romantic couple—<em>and</em> by ve&shy;loci&shy;rap&shy;tors and a T. Rex—manage to save the day.
Meanwhile, greedy human villains plan to profit off the mess
but get eaten before the end to audience applause.
Chris Pratt delivers scruffy heroics
while Bryce Dallas Howard runs around the entire movie
in ridiculous heels without breaking either an ankle or a heel.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Man_(film)">Ant-Man</a> is a light&shy;weight but appealing entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Decades ago, Hank Pym discovered the Pym Particle and invented the Ant-Man suit,
which allowed him to shrink to the size of an ant.
He buries the technology, believing it's too dangerous.
Now his former protégé Darren Cross is close
to perfecting the Yel&shy;low&shy;jack&shy;et shrinking suit and selling it to Hydra.
Pym and his daughter Hope recruit Scott Lang,
a former burglar, to don the Ant-Man suit to stop Cross.</p>
<p>Much of the movie is played for laughs.
Unlike <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/03/05/ReviewDeadpool.html">Deadpool</a>, these are PG-13 laughs.
