<p>I half-watched team sports <em>twice</em> today.
We got up early to go to an Irish friend's house,
to eat a full Irish breakfast and watch rugby.
I no longer detest rugby with the virulence that I had growing up,
when I attended a rugby-playing school in Dublin from ages 7 to 18,
but I'm still not interested in the game.</p>
<p>This afternoon, I went to a Chinese New Year's party,
which doubled as a Superbowl party.
I trans&shy;ferred my feelings about rugby to American football when I moved here.
I have many problems with football culture:
the worship of jocks, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steubenville_High_School_rape_case">rape culture</a>, homophobia, concussion.

Malcolm Gladwell writes of the rather startling findings
concerning brain damage that American foot&shy;ballers sustain over their careers.</p>
<p>The constant butting of heads leads to an
enormously high rate of chronic traumatic en&shy;cephalopa&shy;thy (C.T.E.),
which has symptoms like Alzheimer's.
It's not just the con&shy;cus&shy;sions that cause it,
but all the sub&shy;con&shy;cus&shy;sive contact.
It's almost as dangerous to one's long-term health as boxing.</p>
<p>I grew up <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/03/21/RugbyGrandSlam.html">hating rugby</a> and trans&shy;ferred that hatred to American football.

<p>I grew up hating rugby.
I spent <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/02/19/OlympicsRazorthinMargins.html">eleven years</a> at a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's_College,_Dublin">rugger-bugger school</a> in Dublin.
I couldn't stand the game.
I was a small, unathletic child with no interest in sports.
Rugby, even the modified rugby that they teach seven-year-olds,
was violent and unpleasant and involved running around cold, wet fields.
I had a big operation on my feet when I was 10
and I parlayed that into an excuse never to play rugby again.</p>
<p>I can't remember when I last watched a rugby match,
but it was surely back in the '80s,
as I doubt I've seen one over the 20 years that I've been in the States.</p>

    <p>Anyone who knows me, knows that I have no use for organized sports.
Watching baseball or basketball bores me. I seem to be con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly
incapable of being a sports fan. I'm too much of a watchful outsider to
want to throw myself into rooting for a team.</p>
<p>I actively despise American football. It reminds me far too much of the
rugby of my youth. I spent 11 years at an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stmaryscollegecssp.ie/">Irish rugger-bugger school</a>, so I come by it honestly.
The ugly jock culture that permeates football repels me. The veneration of
football in small-town America annoys me. The fans are obnoxious; the
players, thugs.</p>
<p>I exaggerate, of course. There <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/02/19/OlympicsRazorthinMargins.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
