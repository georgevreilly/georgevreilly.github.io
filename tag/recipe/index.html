    <p>The cen­ter­piece of our back yard is an aging Italian plum tree.
We moved in to our house in late August 2000,
right as the fruit was fully ripe.
We didn't have a ladder and the former owners didn't have time to deal with the tree either,
so most of the fruit that year ended up in the yard waste.
I dragged one enormously heavy yard waste can up the back steps into the alley that year.
I like to say that it weighed as much as I did,
but it probably didn't.</p>
<p>We bought ladders and we've picked the fruit thereafter.
The tree is old and no longer <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/08/28/Plums.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>For the CookBrite holiday party this evening,
we selected recipes from the CookBrite app
and cooked them for each other.</p>
<p>We had a lot of good food.
I par­tic­u­lar­ly enjoyed making and drinking these milkshakes.</p>

<p>Tra­di­tion­al Irish Christmas Pudding.</p>
<p>This recipe comes from my mother, who has used it for many years.
I added the soaking of the fruit in hot water.</p>
<p>This amount makes one large pudding and two smaller ones (4–5 quarts),
so scale down to your needs.</p>
<p>Stick a sprig of holly in the top before bringing to the dinner table.
When it's placed on the dinner table,
heat a tablespoon of brandy or whisky over a flame until it catches fire,
then pour over the pudding.
Turn down the lights to enjoy the blue-tinged flames.</p>
<p>Serve with <a class="reference external" href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/brandy-butter-hard-sauce/">Brandy Butter</a>.</p>

<p>The most common mistakes made by home bakers, pro­fes­sion­als say,

Creaming butter correctly, keeping butter doughs cold,

<p>There's little that I miss about Irish cooking.
One notable exception is Brown Bread aka Brown Soda Bread.
I don't know of any bakery that makes it in the States,
though I've found it at a couple of Irish pubs.
The main difficulty in making it is
finding the coarse-ground wholemeal flour.
The usual fine-ground stuff has the wrong texture.</p>
<p>I know of only one place in the Seattle area that carries
the right flour and that's
The Grainery, 13629 1st Ave S, Burien, WA 98168; (206) 244-5015.
I bought some flour there today,
made a loaf, and brought the loaf and a 10lb bag of flour
to an Irish friend's birthday <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/11/30/IrishBrownBread.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

How to Carve a Turkey
</div><p>Just in case you need some tips for tomorrow's feast.</p>
<p>We're hosting a dinner.
My Irish friends, Paul and Maggie,
who moved to San Jose at the end of last year,
have come up for a few days.
It will be their first Thanks­giv­ing together in the States.
We'll also be joined by Frank & Lyndol,
Raven & Iain, and Peter & Carol.</p>
<p>We're cooking the turkey at high heat,
using Barbara Kafka's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bkafka.com/Recipes/roastturkey.html">500F recipe</a>.
The others are bringing everything else.
Yum.</p>

<p>Last night, I un­wit­ting­ly bought some habenero peppers when I was shopping
for in­gre­di­ents for <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/04/19/BarbecueUniversity.html">Afghan Chicken</a>.
They tasted hot, but not too hot, when I nibbled a couple of small pieces.
I cut them up with my bare hands.
By the time that I was finished, my fingers felt as if they had been burned!
As if I had burned them with steam or something.
It took several hours for the pain to go away.
For­tu­nate­ly, I didn't rub my eyes or more delicate mucous membranes,
while I still had the habenero oils on my skin.</p>
<p>The chicken itself was fine: not too spicy.
