<blockquote>
<p>I like paying taxes. With them I buy civ­i­liza­tion.</p>
<p class="attribution">—Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accountant completed our return last night.
Usually we have something of a rebate,
so the amount that we owed came as an unwelcome surprise.
It's paid now.
Bah!</p>
<p>I pay taxes willing enough, but “like” is too strong.
We cannot run a complex society without taxes.
There are many functions that the vaunted free market performs poorly if at all:
roads, sewers, schools, police, health care, education, defense, emer­gen­cies.
The profit motive is at odds with providing good, dis­pas­sion­ate service.
Government doesn't nec­es­sar­i­ly do it well either,
especially when it's run by people who are ide­o­log­i­cal­ly opposed to taxes.

<p>It takes a special … talent? … chutzpah? … to fuck up the global economic system

<p>In today's New York Times, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/business/economy/11leonhardt.html">David Leonhardt writes</a>,
of a sixteen-year-old economics paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the paper, they argued that several financial crises in the 1980s,
like the Texas real estate bust, had been the result of
private investors taking advantage of the government.
The investors had borrowed huge amounts of money,
made big profits when times were good and
then left the government holding the bag for their eventual
(and pre­dictable) losses.</p>
<p>In a word, the investors looted.
Someone trying to make an honest profit,
Professors Akerlof and Romer said, would have
operated in a completely different manner.
The investors displayed a
“total disregard for even the most basic principles of lending,”

<p>The crisis is at least as grave as the one that confronted us — and,
for a time, united us — after 9/11. Which is why the antics among
Re­pub­li­cans on Capitol Hill seem so surreal. These are the same
politi­cians who only yesterday smeared the patriotism of any dissenters

by then President-elect George Bush, called
‘Our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784">Long National Nightmare</a> Of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over’.
How prophetic!</p>
<p>Finally, the long national nightmare of the George W. Bush presidency is over.</p>
<p>Barack Obama took the oath of office today.
His <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/us/politics/20text-obama.html?pagewanted=all">inaugural speech</a> was somber, reasoned, cautionary, and
in­spi­ra­tional—of a piece with the man.</p>
<p>He faces enormous dif­fi­cul­ties.
There are enormous op­por­tu­ni­ties too, if he can but seize them.
The polls say that the American people do not expect overnight miracles.
I hope we will all remember that a year from now.</p>
<p>Here's to Obama and his presidency.</p>

There I had purchased a 30-day unlimited standby ticket with Delta.
It cost me only $400, as I could produce my round-the-world ticket.</p>

the 30 days with a trip to Washington DC.
There were museums there and it was nearby.</p>

forward as opposed to looking backwards.”</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but if we don’t have an inquest into what happened during the
Bush years — and nearly everyone has taken Mr. Obama’s remarks to mean that
we won’t — this means that those who hold power are indeed above the law
because they don’t face any con­se­quences if they abuse their power.</p>
