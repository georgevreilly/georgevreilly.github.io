    <p>I spent the last 90 minutes reading Facebook,
and my feed has been absolutely over&shy;whelmed with Orlando-related posts,
be they grieving, discussing homophobia, calling for gun control,
or reacting to reactions.
I've never seen such a skewed set of posts.
Some of it is surely Facebook catering to what it knows are my interests,
but it seems like the vast majority of my friends
and the pages that I follow can talk of nothing else.
Even Trump/Clinton/Sanders articles, except as they pertain to this,
have tem&shy;porar&shy;i&shy;ly dis&shy;ap&shy;peared.</p>
<p>So far, I have seen nothing useful from Republican politi&shy;cians
regarding gun control or homophobia.</p>

    <p>I woke up this morning to news of another American massacre:
a lone gunman had murdered 50 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando,
and injured another 53 people.
It was the worst mass shooting in US history and also the worst hate crime.</p>
<p>I put it out of my head for the afternoon while I attended an old friend's wedding,
but it's been at the forefront of my mind ever since.</p>
<p>Only in America could we put up with massacre after massacre,
yet not find the political will to do anything meaningful about gun violence.

    <p>Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee for the 2016 Pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial race.
Although Sanders has not yet ended his campaign, he can't win.
I voted for Sanders in the Washington state caucus
and I still have his yard sign sitting in my front yard.</p>
<p>Unlike some diehard Sanders' supporters,
I have absolutely no qualms getting behind Clinton.
She's one of the most qualified candidates ever to run.
If elected, she will be on the right side of many of the issues I care about
and she will make good ap&shy;point&shy;ments to the Supreme Court.
She's competent and capable and gets things done.
Clinton has survived more scrutiny and more attacks <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/06/09/HillaryClintonPresumptiveNominee.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>The Washington state Democratic Caucus was held today.
The final totals aren't in yet but Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton
by a nearly 3:1 margin around the state.
Our own precinct, SEA 11-1945, had Sanders 41, Clinton 26, Undecided 2.
That translates to 4 Sanders delegates and 2 Clinton delegates
in the next level of caucusing.</p>
<p>Emma and I both voted for Sanders.
We believe that Sanders represents much-needed change
in the party and in the nation.
Clinton is un&shy;doubt&shy;ed&shy;ly one of the most qualified candidates ever,
with an ex&shy;tra&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nary résumé and a high degree of competence.
She's also too tied to the status quo for my liking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In an interview with MSNBC Friday,
2016 Democratic pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial candidate Hillary Clinton said
that Ronald and Nancy Reagan helped start a national con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion about HIV/AIDS.
This is not exactly a bald-faced lie,
but it is a gross mis&shy;un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing of history
and a mis&shy;rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion of the true gov&shy;ern&shy;men&shy;tal neglect
during the AIDS epidemic that killed millions worldwide.</p>

<p>As I wrote on Facebook earlier today:</p>
<blockquote>
I'm really surprised by this.
I expected Hillary Clinton to know better.
It's one thing not to speak ill of the dead at their funeral.
It's quite another to make such a profoundly wrong assertion.

<p>And Trump is no half-bright con man, either.
He's way better than average.</p>

<p>Both Trump and Cruz scare me, for very different reasons.
Trump is impulsive, all id, doesn't give a fuck,
riling up the worst impulses of the American electorate for short-term gain.
Who knows what this loose cannon will do?

speak at <a class="reference external" href="http://townhallseattle.org/">Town Hall Seattle</a> tonight.
He spoke about the topic of his new book,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Divide:_American_Injustice_in_the_Age_of_the_Wealth_Gap">The Divide</a>,
which covers inequality in the United States.
After several years of covering white-collar crime in Wall Street
after the financial collapse of 2008,
and not seeing <em>any</em> pros&shy;e&shy;cu&shy;tions,
he got curious about what the criminal justice system is like for the poor.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-nypds-work-stoppage-is-surreal-20141231">Community policing</a>
is harsh in many poor com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ties,
like Ferguson and Staten Island,
where the police regularly issue tickets for minor in&shy;frac&shy;tions.
Those being summonsed can ill-afford the fines,
often leading to worse con&shy;se&shy;quences.
The U.S. prison population is now twice as high as it was in 1991

<p>I'm fairly confident that Referendum&nbsp;71 will be approved.
It was leading by 51% this morning and by 51.8% this evening,
and leading 2:1 in King County, the most populous, most liberal county in Washington state.</p>
<p>Ballots merely have to be postmarked by Election Day to be valid,
and hundreds of thousands of them have not yet been received by the vote counters.</p>

(SB&nbsp;5688 aka the “ev&shy;ery&shy;thing but marriage bill”),
registered domestic partners (same-sex couples
and opposite-sex couples with at least one partner over age 62),
and married couples, are now treated equally
under the law in all parts of Washington state.</p>
<p>The Religious Right objected and put together an initiative
which scraped together just enough signatures to be on the ballot.
They'll be voting to REJECT the bill,
which would overturn domestic part&shy;ner&shy;ships in this state.</p>
