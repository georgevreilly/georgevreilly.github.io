<p><strong>Approve Referendum 71</strong>.
If you're eligible to vote in Washington state in November,
remember this: <a class="reference external" href="http://approvereferendum71.org/">Approve Referendum 71</a>.</p>
<p>On May 18, 2009, Governor Gregoire signed <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hslda.org/Legislation/State/wa/2009/WASB5688/default.asp">Senate Bill 5688</a>,
aka the “ev­ery­thing but marriage bill” or the Domestic Part­ner­ship Law,
a law ensuring that all Washington families are treated the same,
with the same pro­tec­tions, the same rights,
and the same oblig­a­tions as their neighbors.
Under this law, registered domestic partners (same-sex couples
and opposite-sex couples with at least one partner over age 62),
and married couples, are treated equally
under the law in all parts of the state.</p>
<p>Key rights and oblig­a­tions in the law include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Death benefits for the partners of police <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/08/31/APPROVEReferendum71.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></li></ul>

after a year-long battle with brain cancer.
He was, according to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kennedy">Wikipedia</a>,
the third-longest-serving senator of all time,
elected in 1962, as soon as he became eligible at 30.</p>
<p>He was a great liberal and he ac­com­plished <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kennedy">much</a>.
He will be remembered for much more than
being the youngest brother of Jack and Bobby Kennedy.</p>

<p>Senator Patty Murray visited us at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cozi.com/">Cozi</a> this morning.
She was there to hear from small business people about healthcare reform
and she met with half-a-dozen local small business owners,
including our CEO, Robbie Cape.
I sat in on the meeting as an observer to take <a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/seahcr/PattyMurraySmallBusinessHealthcareMeeting">photos</a>.</p>
<p>We heard a number of stories.</p>
<p>Jason runs a record store.
When they decided to insure all of their employees,
it meant that everyone had to take a pay cut.
One guy didn't want to take part, but Jason convinced him.
Weeks later, that guy broke his arm and ended up in the emergency room.
Not long after, the same guy had another accident.

Barney Frank Confronts Woman at Town Hall

<p>A dozen gun-toting paranoid guys walking around at Obama's town hall in Arizona yesterday,
some of them with ties to the violent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2009/08/az_gun-toters_tied_to_violent_90s_era_militia.php">Viper Militia</a>.</p>
<p>In the video above,
Barney Frank takes a question from some woman who's comparing Obama to a Nazi
and tells her she's talking “vile, con­temptible nonsense”.</p>
<p>I hope it's not going to escalate into outright violence.</p>

<p>We held our <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/07/08/HealthCareNowRallyOnThursday.html">rally</a> for healthcare and the public option at lunchtime,
outside the Jackson Federal Building
where both Senators Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray
have their Seattle offices.</p>
<p>Turnout was good: about 100 people, I'd say.
We had about half-a-dozen speakers over 45 minutes.
A cameraman from King–5 covered it, but I can't find anything on their website.
A handful of people went upstairs to the senators' offices
and delivered 291 pages of petitions.</p>
<p>One concrete suggestion that I came away with
is to write a <em>hand­writ­ten</em> letter to the senators
advocating for healthcare reform.
Hand­writ­ten letters carry more weight than printed letters or calls
and much more weight than emails.</p>
<p>Do it soon.

<p>A couple of weeks ago, a group of us <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/06/27/TalkingToSenatorsAboutHealthcareReform.html">visited our senators' offices</a>
to talk to their staffers about the Public Option in health care.
We're organizing a downtown Seattle rally at the Federal Building on Thursday at 12:15pm,
where both Senators Cantwell and Murray have their offices.
It's one of the large number of rallies that <a class="reference external" href="http://pol.moveon.org/event/events/index.html?action_id=180">MoveOn.org is organizing</a>
at senators' offices all around the country on Thursday.</p>

<p>Today, I did something that I've never done before.
I visited my US Senators' offices, with a handful of others,
to help stiffen their spines on healthcare reform.</p>
<p>It started by accident last night when Mira mentioned on Facebook
that she was going to visit Rep. Jim McDermott, Sen. Maria Cantwell,
and Sen. Patty Murray's Seattle offices today
to talk to them about the “public option”.</p>
<p>McDermott and Murray were already supporters of the public health insurance option.
Cantwell's position was murkier and she came out in favor of
some kind of lame “co-op” compromise earlier this week.
Mira and her friends had no difficulty in setting up meetings with <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/06/27/TalkingToSenatorsAboutHealthcareReform.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Candidate Obama talked a great line in gay rights,
selling himself as a “fierce advocate”.
He'd get rid of the Defense of Marriage Act,
Don't Ask Don't Tell, and more.</p>
<p>President Obama has been a big dis­ap­point­ment on gay rights.
He hasn't done anything about DADT,
he hasn't spoken out about gay marriage,
he hasn't made any gay ap­point­ments.

<p>The California Supreme Court handed down their decision about Propo­si­tion 8 today:
they're letting it stand.
No new gay marriages, though the 18,000 same-sex marriages
that were enacted last year remain valid.</p>
<p>It's a setback to be sure.
The silver lining is that the gay community has been fired up
since Propo­si­tion 8 passed in November.</p>
<p>There's a small but real danger that <a class="reference external" href="http://eqfed.org/campaign/DeclineToSignPet_71">Referendum 71</a>
will make it on to the ballot here in Washington state.
It would roll back the everything-but-marriage domestic part­ner­ship law
that passed recently.</p>
