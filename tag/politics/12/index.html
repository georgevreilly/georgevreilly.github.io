<p>George W. Bush, after months of hinting that he would support the Federal
Marriage Amendment, has endorsed it. He's desparate&shy;ly trying to change the
subject from whether he was AWOL from the National Guard in Alabama.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Campaign is urging everyone to oppose this. They provide a
sample letter to send to your rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives, but I threw it away and
wrote my own (below), which has been sent to my rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives, via the

with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/03/10/int03161.html">Bob Beckel</a>.
Beckel is a longtime

the right wing's dirty tactics at his website,

<blockquote>
<p>We’re in the business of exposing their tactics, some of which I’ve had
used against me before -- like mailing official government-looking
stationery to blacks in precincts in the South, telling them if they
vote in the wrong place, they’ll get a $5,000 fine and a year in jail.
It obviously drove down black turnout. That’s one that Jesse Helms’
thugs used against Harvey Gant in NC. <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/10/18/BobBeckel.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Good article on how the Bush ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion is
<a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/133628_tito10.html">using language to influence public opinion</a>.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p><em>Civil service reform</em> means &quot;flex&shy;i&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty&quot; to replace civil service
protection with cronyism and patronage.</p>
<p><em>Pri&shy;va&shy;ti&shy;za&shy;tion</em> justifies the notion that cor&shy;po&shy;ra&shy;tions are more likely to
serve the public interest than publicly owned utilities, schools and
prisons.</p>
<p><em>Support the troops</em>, a brilliant concept, suggests that if you question
foreign policy or war policy, you have the deaths of our finest young men
and women in uniform on your hands. Objective: to stifle public dissent.</p>

about the psychology of con&shy;ser&shy;vatism report that at the core of

political con&shy;ser&shy;vatism include:</p>

<p>I detest George W. Bush and his ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion. The war, the economy, the
en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment, the judicial battles. I loathe just about everything that
comes out of the White House. I want that man <em>gone</em>.</p>
<p>I've been following the Democratic pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial candidates with some
interest for the last few months. Right now, I feel like I'm a yellow dog
Democrat. I don't care who wins in 2004, just so long as it's a Democrat.</p>
<p>That's not really true, however. I'd much rather have a candidate that I
have some enthusiasm for, rather than the lesser of two evils: <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/06/12/HowardDeanForPresident.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
