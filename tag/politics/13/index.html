<p>Peter Turnley is a pho&shy;to&shy;jour&shy;nal&shy;ist who covered the first Gulf War.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0212/pt_intro.html">The Unseen Gulf War</a>
is his collection of previously un&shy;pub&shy;lished photos from
that war. The photos present no political viewpoint, but what they do
&quot;represent is a part of a more accurate picture of what really does happen
in war&quot;. Warning: there are a number of graphic images of corpses.</p>

<p>Almost, but not quite, at war with Iraq. Saddam has forty-eight hours to
quit Iraq and avert war, but no-one expects him to do that. Feh.</p>
<p>I would feel slightly better about the new war if Bush had managed to forge
a broad-based coalition. Instead, in their heavy&shy;hand&shy;ed way, Bush, Rumsfeld,
Cheney, and Perle have managed to piss off most of the world.</p>

<p>Michael Savage is a radical right-wing talk-radio host and author, far more

<p>Along with perhaps

Emma and I took part in a peace

meet up with our friends before the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.feb15.org/">Seattle rally</a>,
although we did run into
another friend as the march set off.</p>
<p>There were an estimated <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/aplocal_story.asp?category=6420&amp;slug=WA%20Anti%20War%20Protests%20Wash">20,000 people</a>
at the Seattle rally, according to
the Seattle P-I. I would have thought more. It took eighty minutes from the
first marchers setting out to the last of the marchers getting a few blocks
away from the Seattle Center.</p>

<p>As part of the wave of peace rallies moving across the world today and
tomorrow, there will be a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.feb15.org/">Seattle Rally</a>. Gather
at the Seattle Center's In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al Fountain at 11:30am, rally at noon,

<p>Hans Blix presented his latest report to the UN this morning. No surprises.
Saddam is not being par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly co&shy;op&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tive, there are some &quot;proscribed&quot;
missiles, but they've found no evidence that Iraq is hiding prohibited
weapons. All the players held fast to their positions.</p>
<p>Colin Powell hammered home the point that if Saddam had nothing to hide,
the Iraqi scientists would be lining up to be in&shy;ter&shy;viewed by UN inspectors.
True, but that's still not a <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2003/02/10/CasusBelliII.html">case for going to war</a>.</p>

<p>I've been meaning to rant about this for a while now, but haven't found the
time yet.</p>
<p>Last Friday, the

Previously, it had been kept in almost complete secrecy, only being shown
to Dennis Hastert and Dick Cheney.</p>
<p>The Domestic Security En&shy;hance&shy;ment Act of 2003 (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailyrotten.com/source-docs/patriot2draft.html">full text</a>) is

delaying no&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion to targets of in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tions for up to three months,
secret subpoenas, crippling the Freedom of In&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion Act, deporting
American citizens, huge new powers for the FBI, and more.</p>

<p>Colin Powell went to the UN and made a case that Saddam has not disarmed
and that he continues to act in defiance of the UN. Not too surprising,
since that's what Blix has said. If Saddam had nothing to hide, he would
have cooperated with the UNMOVIC inspectors.</p>
<p>What Powell did not show is why Saddam's defiance warrants going to war.</p>
<p>Some doubt the veracity of Powell's case, citing the ease of forging
evidence. This is the same ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion that gave us the
