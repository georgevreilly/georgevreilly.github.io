He moved from labor organizing to social organizing in the late 1930s,

famous by Upton Sinclair in <em>The Jungle</em>. He is generally considered the

<p>Joe Lieberman, the 2000 vice-pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial nominee, lost the Democratic primary
for his Senate seat tonight. He has said that he will run as an in&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dent.
In effect, he will not accept the will of the people.</p>
<p>Lieberman lost, in part, because of his continuing refusal to admit that
the Iraq war is a disaster, and in part because he has been a leading
enabler of the Republican agenda. Good riddance!</p>

<p>In the 1980s, in order to solidify their shift from divorce to

accepted by most Americans as true. Simply put, the abortion myth is
this: Leaders of the Religious Right would have us believe that their
movement began in direct response to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973
<em>Roe v. Wade</em> decision. Po&shy;lit&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tive evan&shy;gel&shy;i&shy;cal leaders were so

we went to see Al Gore's new doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary on global climate change,

when it opened in Seattle last night. We brought some friends too.</p>
<p>Gore lays out a compelling case that global climate change is real,
that it's been happening for decades, and that it's spiralling out of
control. He backs it up with plenty of statistics and graphs.</p>

<li>The ten hottest years on record have all been since 1990.</li>
