having had the very highest security clearances myself, having done a
huge amount of pro­fes­sion­al in­tel­li­gence analysis, and having been
inside the spin machine....</p>

He moved from labor organizing to social organizing in the late 1930s,

<p>Joe Lieberman, the 2000 vice-pres­i­den­tial nominee, lost the Democratic primary
for his Senate seat tonight. He has said that he will run as an in­de­pen­dent.
In effect, he will not accept the will of the people.</p>
<p>Lieberman lost, in part, because of his continuing refusal to admit that
the Iraq war is a disaster, and in part because he has been a leading
enabler of the Republican agenda. Good riddance!</p>

<p>In the 1980s, in order to solidify their shift from divorce to
abortion, the Religious Right con­struct­ed an <em>abortion myth</em>, one
accepted by most Americans as true. Simply put, the abortion myth is

movement began in direct response to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973

<p>Gore lays out a compelling case that global climate change is real,
that it's been happening for decades, and that it's spiralling out of
control. He backs it up with plenty of statistics and graphs.</p>
