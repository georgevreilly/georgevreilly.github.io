    <p>A very in­ter­est­ing piece in last Sunday's New York Times magazine:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/magazine/26taliban.html">A Talib at Yale</a>.
Sayed Rah­mat­ul­lah Hashemi is the former "roving am­bas­sador" for the
Taliban, now studying at Yale.
An in­ter­est­ing and improbable life story.</p>
<p>The right-wing bl­o­gos­phere is furious about it. I say it's better to co-opt
moderate former Talibs than to freeze them out.</p>
<p>Besides, his B-grades at Yale are better than George Bush's
"Gentle­man's-C".</p>

    <p>This morning, I sent the following letter to the Democratic
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Senator,</p>
<p>Your job last week was to show up Samuel Alito as the extremist that he is.</p>
<p>You failed. You were out­ma­neu­vred by the Re­pub­li­cans and you did not make
a compelling case when you had the spotlight on you. Instead many of you
were, rightfully, pilloried as bloviating blowhards.</p>
<p>Do you really want your legacy to be that you swung the Supreme Court
to the right for three decades? Do you want to remembered as one who
lost Roe v. Wade? That you placed someone with a track record of
priv­i­leg­ing the executive <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/01/16/FilibusterAlito.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

<li>13) "If you'll look at my lovely FEMA attire you'll really vomit.
I am a fashion god…
Anything specific I need to do or tweak?
Do you know of anyone who dog-sits?
… Can I quit now? Can I come home? …
I'm trapped now, please rescue me."
--Ex-FEMA Director Michael Brown, in various emails to colleagues and friends
in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina</li>

<p>I put to you that the United States is without doubt the greatest show on the road.
Brutal, in­dif­fer­ent, scornful and ruthless it may be

As a salesman it is out on its own

It's a winner.

<blockquote>
<p>Mc­Carthy­ism was a raging plague in the 1950s
and the virus rampaged across Texas like tum­ble­weeds in a wind storm.
...
The low point, said Maverick, came when the state Senate passed a bill
to remove all books from public libraries which “ad­verse­ly” reflected
on American and Texas history, the family and religion.
Even the state teachers as­so­ci­a­tion endorsed the bill,
in exchange for a pay raise. ...</p>
<p>That was the lay of the land in the 1950s.
And Democrats were in charge, remember?
That’s right: Texas was a one-party state;

would attack the US. Thousands died.</p>
<p>In March 2003, Bush started an un­nec­es­sary war against Iraq.
Tens of thousands died.</p>
<p>In August 2005, Bush ignored warnings that a major hurricane
would strike New Orleans, and stayed on vacation.
He played guitar in Arizona while New Orleans drowned.
Uncounted thousands died.</p>
<p>Not until Wednesday did he return to Washington.
Even now, he has yet to show leadership.
Photo ops are not leadership. Platitudes are not leadership.</p>
