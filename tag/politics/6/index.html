<p>I spent some time earlier this evening phone banking for
Obama and some Washington State races,
at the new Beacon Hill HQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We now have a location on Beacon Hill to volunteer for Obama and Gregoire.
It's between Horton and Hinds on Beacon Ave. S.  It's a place you can
volunteer for phone banking or pick up packets to canvass your neighbors.</p>
<p>There's an open house on Wednesday, September 24th between 5 and 9 pm. Stop
by to phone bank, share food with your neighbors, and get to know other
Obama supporters in your area.</p>

<p>After months of attacking Obama's “in&shy;ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence”,
McCain has picked an unknown first-term governor from a minor state
with an un&shy;der&shy;whelm&shy;ing resume.</p>
<p>What gross ir&shy;re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty!
A seventy-two-year-old with a history of skin cancer,
who feels the need to keep his medical records under a tight wrap,
should have a running mate who's ready to
take over at any time.
When you compare her to Biden or Obama,
Palin clearly isn't.
I sincerely believe that I'm better informed about the world than she is,
based on reports of her lack of interest in Iraq until recently,
and that she didn't have a passport until 2007.</p>
<p>What she does bring to the ticket is hard-right,

<p>It's been too long since I last posted an Odds &amp; Ends.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7ibPk37_U">Henri</a> is a very amusing short spoof of French ennui.</p>
<p>Back in January, Emma and I were being repeatedly shocked
by static elec&shy;tric&shy;i&shy;ty.
We would in&shy;ad&shy;ver&shy;tent&shy;ly discharge by kissing or
otherwise touching each other,
or by touching laptops or faucets.
Eventually, I realised that it was due to a com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion
of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf69496036.tip.html">microfiber upholstery</a> on our new couch
and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hardforum.com/showthread.php?p=1031999079">dry, unhumid air</a>.
We solved it by a com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion of rubbing an anti-static dryer sheet (Bounce)
on the couch and buying a humidifier.
That led to a spate of jokes about the spark being gone.</p>
<p>It's started coming back again.

<p>I sent this letter to the New York Times this morning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was struck by the jux&shy;ta&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/opinion/06kamenetz.html">Anya Kamenetz's thoughtful column</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/opinion/06dowd.html">Maureen Dowd's puerile nonsense</a> on today's op-ed page.</p>
<p>Anya Kamenetz's makes a sensible proposal on empowering ready teenagers by
lowering the age thresholds for voting, drinking, credit cards when they
demon&shy;strate maturity.</p>
<p>Maureen Dowd continues in her usual rut, going on again about Ch&shy;eneyesque
paranoia, Bill's legacy, Obambi, and tough dames.</p>
<p>Perhaps Ms. Dowd could take Ms. Kamenetz's maturity test.</p>
