<p>Inspired by <a class="reference external" href="http://drinkingliberally.org/locations.html">Drinking Liberally</a>, I've founded my own little pro&shy;gres&shy;sive
movie club. It will meet at my house on the first Wednesday of every month.
We show a pro&shy;gres&shy;sive film, followed by a discussion.
Typically, these will be political doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;taries,
but you can also expect to see non-political doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;taries, fiction,
and even the occasional right-wing piece for contrast.</p>
<p>The first film will be shown this coming Wednesday.
Here's the an&shy;nounce&shy;ment that I just sent out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We'll show ONE of the following movies on Wednesday, February 7th. Those
who show up will make the choice.</p>

<p>I got a reply from Maria Cantwell's office, regarding the email that I sent
about <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/02/02/AttackingIran.html">Attacking Iran</a>. Clearly no brain cells were used in sending out

<p>Dear Mr. Reilly,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns for the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of
nuclear weapons in Iran.  I appreciate hearing from you on this important
issue.</p>
<p>As you may know, in&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al nuclear inspectors continue to monitor
whether Iran is developing nuclear weapons.  Such a program would be in
con&shy;tra&shy;ven&shy;tion to the nuclear non-pro&shy;lif&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion agreement that Iran has
signed.  In November 2004, the countries of Britain, France, and Germany

<p>In the past few weeks, I've received not one but two letters from
Christine Gregoire, the governor of Washington State, looking for support in
re-electing her. The thing is, is that she's running in 2008, not 2006.</p>
<p>I threw away the first one. On the second one, I wrote something like this
and mailed it back:</p>
<blockquote>
If this had come in December, I have been willing to support you.
But not six weeks from a high-stakes election. What the <em>hell</em> are you
thinking? Don't bother me again before 2008.</blockquote>
<p>Sheer idiocy. Why would anyone send her money at the moment,
instead of making donations towards the mid-term elections?</p>
