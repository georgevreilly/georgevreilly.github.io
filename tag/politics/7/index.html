<p>David Postman says that State Senator Eric Oemig is
once again <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/davidpostman/2008/01/lawmaker_pushes_again_for_impeachment_of_president.html">pushing for im&shy;peach&shy;ment</a> in the Washington State Leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;ture.
Washington for Im&shy;peach&shy;ment has the text of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonforimpeachment.org/blog/index.php?entry=entry080113-212558">SJM 8016</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the comment that I posted under Postman's article.
It's based upon a speech that I gave at Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters last year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've had enough.
I'm sick of the lies.
I'm tired of the scandals.
I'm angry at the loss of civil liberties.</p>
<p>Scandals like the US Attorneys' firings,
the Walter Reed out&shy;pa&shy;tients,
the Katrina debacle.
Pardoning Scooter Libby, who outed an undercover CIA agent.
Voter sup&shy;pres&shy;sion.
The War on Science.
Theocracy.
Corruption.
The War on the En&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment.
Food safety.
Toy safety.
The Pat Tillman coverup.
Terri Schiavo.
700+ signing statements.</p>

<p>I was just watching the Colbert Report and Sam Waterston was on,
touting <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unity08.com/">Unity08</a>.
Except that both he and Colbert kept pro&shy;nounc&shy;ing it as
<em>Unity-oh-Eight dot com</em>, not <em>Unity-zero-Eight dot com</em>.
I knew what they meant of course, but I decided to see
what was at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unityo8.com/">Unityo8</a>.
Naturally, they don't own the domain, despite having existed for more than a year.
Such in&shy;com&shy;pe&shy;tence.</p>
<p>As for their third-way platform, I expect that they would
act as a spoiler, most likely splitting the Democratic vote,
as Nader (cursed be his name) did in 2000.
Their list of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mydd.com/story/2006/12/4/19375/7945">sponsors</a> is quite suspect too.
<a class="reference external" href="http://irregulartimes.com/index.php/archives/category/unity08/">Irregular Times</a> lists a number of problems with Unity08.</p>
