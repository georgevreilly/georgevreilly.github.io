<p>I don't, as a rule, pay a great deal of attention to Canadian politics.
I was vaguely aware that something unusual is going on there this week.
Then Emma pointed me to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yarnharlot.ca/blog/archives/2008/12/03/what_is_happening_in_canada.html">Yarn Harlot</a>'s ex­pla­na­tion
of what's happened.</p>
<p>In brief, for the last two years,
Stephen Harper's minority government has been playing
a high-stakes game, repeatedly forcing the opposition parties
to either vote with him or force an election, which they
would likely lose.</p>
<p>Last week, as soon as Parliament resumed after October's general election,
Harper put forth an "economic strategy", which included removing
federal election subsidies to all par­ties—­ef­fec­tive­ly hobbling the opposition.
The opposition were deeply unhappy about that,
and also <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/05/Proroguery.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Emma worked at WaMu as a software tester for three years.
I'm sure that if she were still there, she'd be one of them.
Most of her friends from that time have moved on;
just as well.</p>
<p>A few years ago, WaMu seemed too big to fail.
Now? Circling the toilet bowl.</p>
<p>Our whole economy seems like it was one giant Ponzi scheme,
with everyone selling worthless paper to everyone else.
It's hard to tell how much was wilful ignorance,
and how much was making a buck while the good times lasted
and damn the con­se­quences.</p>

<p>For decades, Detroit has fought a rearguard action against
change—seat­belts, CAFE standards for increased fuel efficiency,
met­ri­ca­tion, renewable energy, building gas guzzling SUVs
instead of hybrids, all come to mind.</p>
<p>Change is needed.
The current management must go.
The big three must build vehicles that make sense.</p>

but his op-ed piece, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html">Let Detroit Go Bankrupt</a>,
in Wednes­day's NYT lands in the vicinity of the mark.</p>
<p>He ignores one big reason for the higher costs of American cars,
the cost of company-funded healthcare.</p>

<p>I was pissed when Nader ran in 2004,
after going dark for three years.
He had built up a big movement in 2000.
Nearly three million people voted for him.
If he was remotely serious about the issues he was cam­paign­ing on in 2000,
he would have done something in 2001–2003.
God knows there was plenty of things that needed fighting.
He could have made a difference.

<p>There was only sour note to the huge victories in Tuesday's elections:
the passage of Propo­si­tion 8, the anti-gay marriage amendment in California.
A deceitful campaign preyed on voters' fears and homophobia.
The No on 8 campaign was massively outspent and not very effective.</p>
<p>I'm convinced that marriage equality will come, but this is a setback.
Gay couples, who only gained the right to marry earlier this year in
California, have lost that right.</p>
<p>The Mormon Church was the prime mover behind the Yes on 8 campaign,
donating $19 million, nearly 80% of the total raised.
A backlash is brewing.

<p>I'm delighted!
Today, the American people made an excellent decision
and chose the right man for the job.</p>
<p>Obama fought a long, hard campaign,
rising from underdog to an assured victory.
He ran an exemplary, innovative campaign,
that empowered millions of grassroots activists.
He shattered barriers and inspired voters.</p>
<p>He won by a huge margin in the Electoral College,
giving himself un­equiv­o­cal legitimacy.
He'll need it.
The country has deep problems and it's not going to be an easy presidency.</p>
<p>Nev­er­the­less, I look forward to the next four years.</p>

<p>I'm voting for Obama, which is no secret to anyone who knows me.
I agree with his policies and I'm impressed by the man.
Over the last two years, he's run an excellent campaign,
going from underdog to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2008/10/25/obamas_lead/">all-but certain victory</a>.
Clearly, he has executive ability.</p>
<p>Moreover, McCain is the wrong man for the job.
I strongly disagree with his policies (es­sen­tial­ly Bush's),
his campaign is thrashing spas­ti­cal­ly,
and he dis­qual­i­fied himself by picking that blithering idiot Palin as his VP.</p>
<p>I'm more worried about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chrisgregoire.com/">Christine Gregoire</a>,
who is running for re-election as Governor of Washington.
She's un­com­fort­ably close in the polls to Dino Rossi.
