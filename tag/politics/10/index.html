<p>Amy Sullivan has a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0605.sullivan1.html">piece in the Washington Monthly</a>
about the little-sung successes of the Democrats.</p>
<p>Apparently, there is some strategy and co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;na&shy;tion going on in the
Democratic leadership, despite what the press might lead you to believe.
The Dubai ports deal blew up because Schumer kept calling press con&shy;fer&shy;ences
about it, though Schumer has hardly been credited with lobbing the grenade.
Murtha was not left out in the cold by Pelosi and other Dems; it was a
deliberate strategy to prevent him being labeled as a token hawk.
And the Dems managed to kill Bush's pri&shy;va&shy;ti&shy;za&shy;tion of Social Security,
by dis&shy;ci&shy;plined attacks on Bush's &quot;risky&quot; proposal. Their not <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/05/16/NotAsLameAsYouThink.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>On Saturday night, at the White House Cor&shy;re&shy;spon&shy;dents Dinner,
Stephen Colbert did something brave and unparalled.
Standing 10 feet from George Bush and in front of an audience

Colbert, acting in his persona of a Bill O'Reil&shy;lyesque pundit,
flayed them with irony and sarcasm.</p>

<p>Jim has been a strong pro&shy;gres&shy;sive voice in Congress for years.
His early opposition to the Iraq War led to him being dubbed 'Baghdad Jim'

to support Howard Dean's bid for the presidency. He had a big role in
Fahrenheit 9/11. And he reads the role of Leopold Bloom for the

    <p>It's no secret that Bush is ap&shy;palling&shy;ly vacuous and incoherent whenever he
has to answer a question that he hasn't been prepped for. Here are a few
excerpts from his recent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/04/20060410-1.html">appearance at Johns Hopkins University</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Presidency Is No Place for a Smart person</strong></p>
<blockquote>
We're a in&shy;flu&shy;en&shy;tial nation, and so, therefore, many problems come
to the Oval Office. And you don't know what those problems are
going to be, which then argues for having smart people around.
That's why you ought to serve in government if you're not going to
be the President. You have a chance to influence policy by giving
good rec&shy;om&shy;men&shy;da&shy;tions to the President.</blockquote>
