<p>Days before graduation, a shooting takes place in the girls' bathroom
at a suburban Maryland high school.
The popular, pretty Kat is dead;
the athletic Josie was shot in the foot;
and the drama star and shooter, Perri,
is comatose after shooting herself in the head.
The three girls had been in&shy;sep&shy;a&shy;ra&shy;ble since third grade,
though Perri and Kat had fallen out the previous summer.
What happened? What led Perri to such an act?</p>

<p>More than two thousand years ago, the balance of power shifted,
Africa became the dominant continent, and Europe stayed a barbarian backwater.
Muslim Africans sailed west and conquered America,
using white slaves as a workforce.</p>
<p>Aidan O'Dere was kidnapped as a boy from an Irish fishing village,
and sold to the Wakil, the governor of what would otherwise be Galveston.
The Wakil's younger son, Kai, is the same age as Aidan.
The Wakil and Kai are sensitive men, warriors with poets' souls,
with misgivings about the in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion of slavery.

To get him back—and she's not sure she wants him back—she must go undercover

<p>Mary-Mathilda has been the mistress of Bellfeels,
a plantation owner in Bimshire (a lightly fic&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ized Barbados),
since her early teens.
One night, she calls the police to confess a crime.
Sargeant, who has silently loved her since they were children,
takes her Statement over the course of a very long, discursive night.
A night in which many ugly secrets bubble to the surface.
Secrets about Mary-Mathilda's past,
secrets about the English elite who ruled pre-War Bimshire,
secrets about the plantation:
secrets that Sargeant doesn't really want to hear.</p>

Heavy&shy;weight standards that in many ways reinvent

The promised in&shy;ter&shy;op&shy;er&shy;abil&shy;i&shy;ty hasn't really happened:
