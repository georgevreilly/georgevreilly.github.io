<p>Inspired by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.96db.com/blog/ReadingNotes/">Keith Martin's Reading Notes</a>, I've decided to try writing
a short review of every book that I read, starting today.
I expect that most reviews will be 100 to 250 words.</p>
<p>Why? Like my <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/12/05/PictureOfTheDayProject.html">Picture of the Day project</a>, it should help me think a
little harder about what I'm reading, if I know that I'm going to have to
say something pithy about it.
I'm a better pho&shy;tog&shy;ra&shy;ph&shy;er than I am a reviewer,
so the exercise should be good for me.</p>
<p>Now you know why I put together a way of <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/12/30/RatingWithStars.html">Rating with Stars</a>
for dasBlog yesterday.</p>
<p>The first two reviews have already been written and will <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/12/31/BookReviews.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Julieanne Kost, a Photoshop evangelist for Adobe, flies 200 days a year.
For the last five years, she's been taking photos out of airplane windows.</p>
<p>This book is part pretty pictures, part a meditation on creativity, and
part a Photoshop tutorial.</p>
<p>It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words.
That must be why the word count is so low.
In the first 120 pages, there are eight pages of text on creativity,

    <p>I'm in&shy;dif&shy;fer&shy;ent to most fantasy books, but I've been a fan of
George R.R. Martin's <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series,
since I read the first book,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553573403/georgvreill-20">A Game of Thrones</a>,
in 1997.
I read the second book
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553108034/georgvreill-20">A Clash of Kings</a>,
in 1999.
The third book
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055357342X/georgvreill-20">A Storm of Swords</a>
came out five years ago, and I've been awaiting
the fourth book,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553801503/georgvreill-20">A Feast for Crows</a>,
ever since.
After several post&shy;pone&shy;ments, it's finally out.</p>
<p>It's an epic tale of love, war, and intrigue.
Five Kings are fighting for control,
by sword, by guile, and sometimes by magic.
Strange creatures are rising in the frozen North, beyond the Wall.
Dragons are reap&shy;pear&shy;ing in the South.

    <p>On Saturday, I bought <em>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</em>
at CostCo. On leaving, the checker told me that I had bought the
887th copy at the store. This was 1pm, three hours after opening,
so they were selling at the rate of five per minute.</p>
<p>I started reading it last night. After two chapters,
when I had seen far too many references to earlier books
that I didn't recall, I decided that it was time to
re-read the earlier books. I'm a fast reader, but I don't
retain material very well.</p>
<p>In the first chapter of the first book, I came across
an ironically prophetic statement, made by Professor <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/07/19/AHarryPotterProphecy.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>I've been a fan of both Bernard Cornwell and Patrick O'Brian
for a number of years.
Both are known for their historic fiction set in the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
<p>Cornwell has written 20 <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bernardcornwell.net/index2.cfm?page=1&amp;SeriesId=1">books about Richard Sharpe</a>,
a rough and ready British Army officer, up from the ranks.
Cornwell excels at writing battle scenes, capturing the
smells and sounds, the noise and confusion, the blood and the gore.
Some of them were turned into a TV miniseries in the mid-1990s,
with Sean Bean as Sharpe.</p>
<p>O'Brian wrote 20 novels about Captain Jack Aubrey and
Dr. Stephen Maturin of the Royal Navy.
The Russell Crowe movie
