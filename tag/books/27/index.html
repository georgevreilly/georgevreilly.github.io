<p>Kvothe—the infamous, legendary Kvothe—has been living under an assumed name
when the Chronicler tracks him down and asks him for his life story.
Kvothe relates the story of his early years:
his precocious talents for music and arcanism (magic);
the happy childhood that ends
when his parents and their troupe are murdered by an ancient evil;
his years as a feral street child;
and his early entrance into the University to study the Arcanum,
where his brilliance makes him a star and his reck&shy;less&shy;ness brings him much <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/07/24/ReviewTheNameOfTheWind.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Le Carré's very first novel,
<em>Call for the Dead</em> introduces his most famous character, George Smiley.
After a harmonious meeting with Smiley to review his security clearance,
Samuel Fennan goes home, writes a letter com&shy;plain&shy;ing of har&shy;rass&shy;ment,
and commits suicide.
But little things don't add up and Smiley starts in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gat&shy;ing,
only to be nearly murdered himself.</p>
<p>A strong debut, and amazingly short at 160&nbsp;pages.
<em>Call</em> provides some background about Smiley's very bad war,
undercover in Nazi ter&shy;ri&shy;to&shy;ries, and his rocky marriage.</p>
