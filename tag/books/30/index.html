<p>Rural Texas, 1980.
Llewelyn Moss, out hunting in the middle of nowhere,
finds the remains of a drug buy that went wrong:
dead bodies, shot-up cars, black tar heroin.
And a satchel with two million dollars in cash.
Moss takes the money and runs.
He knows it's stupid, he knows that people will come after him,
and he does it anyway.</p>
<p>Anton Chigurh is the worst of the killers on his trail.
Relentless, re&shy;morse&shy;less, untroubled by conscience,
and offended by the wrongness of Moss's act.
He and Moss will be <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/23/ReviewNoCountryForOldMen.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Ten LAPD patrolmen congregate regularly in MacArthur Park for “choir practice”:
late-night bitchfests, marathon boozing,
and group sex with a couple of cocktail waitresses.</p>
<p>LA's finest are not exactly fine specimens of humanity,
but then neither are the people they serve,
whom they consider little better than the ones they arrest.
The choirboys include an idealist, a psychopath,
a prankster, and a world-class mooch.
They fight and they drink and they argue:
everything but discuss the things that really bother them.
Wambaugh lampoons the choirboys,
but he reserves his full contempt for their <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/20/ReviewTheChoirboys.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>DI John Rebus in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gates the murder of an illegal immigrant,
who had ties to asylum seekers in Edinburgh.
DS Siobhan Clarke looks into the dis&shy;ap&shy;pear&shy;ance of a teenaged girl;
soon, the rapist of the girl's sister is murdered.</p>
<p>Rebus and Siobhan struggle with the uglier side of life in Edinburgh,
notably, racism, latter-day slavery, and the increasing numbers of asylum seekers.
As usual, their personal lives are in a mess:
Rebus drinks too much;
Siobhan falls asleep with a tub of ice cream.</p>

<p>Bay Tanner is a young widow and aspiring private in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tor
from wealthy South Carolina stock.
When a hitherto unknown <a class="reference external" href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-shi5.htm">shirt-tail</a> cousin (fifth half cousin, specif&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly)
bursts into Bay's life, she brings havoc in her train.</p>
<p>As one of the characters says,
the plot sounds like a made-for-TV movie.
Still, Bay is a feisty heroine and
the background is not one that has been mined deeply.</p>

<p>I was Toast&shy;mas&shy;ter of the Day at this evening's meeting of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.FreelySpeaking.org/">Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters</a>.
My theme was software de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment and I wanted to give the non-developer audience
a taste for what it's like to write a program.
I talked about writing a simple Sudoku game.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read <em>Pro&shy;gram&shy;ming Sudoku</em> for background.
I bought this book for Emma after reading about it on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ProgrammingSudoku.aspx">Scott Hansel&shy;man's blog</a>.
It's targeted at beginning pro&shy;gram&shy;mers and
walks them through building a Sudoku game and solver.
I was hoping to get Emma more interested in pro&shy;gram&shy;ming—un&shy;suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly.

<p>In the 1850s, three anti-slavery families settled next to each other

Seven gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tions later, the last of the Fremantles is gone,
