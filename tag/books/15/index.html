<p>Willie Dunne is the innocent 18-year-old son of a senior Dublin policeman,
who promptly joins the Royal Dublin Fusiliers when the First World War breaks out,
along with thousands of other Irishmen.
Their early optimism that the war will be over by Christmas 1914 is soon crushed
as both sides get bogged down in the trench warfare of the Western Front.
Four long, brutal years of stalemate in the killing fields of Flanders follow,
and much of Willie's regiment die during <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2015/02/01/ReviewALongLongWay.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>When I buy a book, I want to be able to read it how and where I like,
not where the bookseller dictates.
With printed books, the very idea of the bookseller having any say is ridiculous.
The book is now my property, to read where and how I like,
to give away or to lend or even to sell.
I've bought thousands of new books and thousands more secondhand books from bookstores.</p>
<p>Most electronic books are crippled with DRM.
DRM stands for <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">Digital Rights Management</a>,
although <a class="reference external" href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/">Defective By Design</a> prefers to expand DRM
as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management">Digital Re&shy;stric&shy;tions Management</a>.
DRM is technology that controls digital content <em>after</em> it has been sold.

to the audiobook of <em>The Hot Rock</em>, the first of the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dortmunder">Dortmunder</a> novels.
I just finished reading it as an ebook on my phone.
I enjoyed it a lot but I think I found it funnier when I heard it as an audiobook.
Partly, the first time around, I didn't know what was coming next;
partly, the narrator's skillful delivery gave me time to savor the humor.

<p>Jack Whyte's <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camulod_Chronicles">Camulod Chronicles</a> is a series of novels
about King Arthur and Camelot in a post-Roman Britain.
This book tells how Lancelot (Clothar the Frank) came to Camulod and met Arthur—and it takes the entire book to get to that point.
Only after several hundred pages of Clothar's childhood and early manhood
and fighting a civil war in his uncle's small kingdom in Gaul,
do we proceed to Britain.</p>

    <p>I've always been an avid—nay, avari&shy;cious—read&shy;er of books.
But I have not been a listener of audiobooks.</p>
<p>I read quickly, much more quickly than anyone can speak,
and I enjoy burying my head in a book.
I've seen little reason, therefore, to listen to audiobooks.
Lately, however, we've listened to some audiobooks on long car trips,
as Emma, unlike me, has an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.audible.com/">Audible</a> sub&shy;scrip&shy;tion.
We enjoyed <a class="reference external" href="https://mobile.audible.com/pd/Mysteries-Thrillers/The-Hot-Rock-Audiobook/B003N9T8SA">The Hot Rock</a>, the first of the comic crime-caper <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dortmunder">Dortmunder</a> books.
Before that, I had read another Dortmunder novel, <em>Bank Shot</em>, aloud to Emma,
while she drove us back from Portland,
which both of us had enjoyed.</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Tony McLean of the Edinburgh Police has multiple deaths to deal with:
an elderly rich man, murdered horribly;
the newly discovered corpse of a girl killed in some ghoulish ritual sixty years ago;
and the death of the grand&shy;moth&shy;er who raised him.
Then more elderly men start being murdered.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this police procedural and I liked the character of Tony McLean.
The two cases start dove&shy;tail&shy;ing together (one of my pet peeves)
and I was surprised when the author introduced su&shy;per&shy;nat&shy;ur&shy;al elements,

Danny, as his parents did before him, is making a mess of his life,

Marsh discovers more about Peggy—and him&shy;self—than he really wants to.</p>

I found the plot and the characters plausible,
