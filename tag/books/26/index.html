<p>The unnamed nar&shy;ra&shy;tor—My name? If I told you that you'd be as clever as me—is an up-and-coming London drug dealer who wants to retire by his thirtieth birthday.
He's pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al, low-key, and a little bit cocky,
and he has every chance of pulling it off.
He re&shy;luc&shy;tant&shy;ly does a favor for the crime boss Jimmy Price and
suddenly his plans are derailed.
Double-crosses, snitches, betrayals, murders, hold ups, and stings ensue.
There's little honor among thieves, save for our hero's immediate circle.</p>

<p>After crusading financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist is convicted of libel,
he re&shy;luc&shy;tant&shy;ly agrees to in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gate the 40-year-old dis&shy;ap&shy;pear&shy;ance

<p>For four thousand years, the gods have dwelt in human form
amongst the people of Myrillia, rooted to the very land.
When the goddess Meeryn is found murdered and the disgraced Shad&shy;owknight
Tylar de Noche is found at her side, mirac&shy;u&shy;lous&shy;ly healed of his maiming,
he is accused of being the godslayer.
He escapes and uncovers a dark conspiracy of corruption and evil.</p>
<p>As an exercise in world building, this book succeeds.
For example, the gods' <em>humors</em>—blood, seed, menses, sweat, tears, saliva, phlegm,
and yellow bile and black bile (“piss and shite”)—are collected <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/08/08/ReviewShadowfall.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>A century and a half ago, the believers in the Black Road were forced into exile.
Now, in some bloody surprise attacks, they've conquered the Glas Valley.
The story is largely told from the viewpoints of three brother-sister pairs:
the young leaders of the Black Road attackers;
the adolescent nephew and niece of the thane of the Lannis-Haig Blood;
and a warrior of the Kyrinin race and his sister.
Each side believes that it is in the right:
the clash between two human cultures was inevitable,

Arjun comes from his far-distant home, seeking the Voice,
the god that abandoned his people.

only to be captured in the warship <em>Thunderer</em>.
A boy, Jack, also captures part of the Bird's power
as he flees the workhouse.</p>

<p>Robert Hughes has been in love with Barcelona and its people for four decades.
This book—part selective history, part memoir—is adapted from a much larger, earlier book about Barcelona.
Hughes is a partisan of Catalan culture and food.
He brings us from its Roman origins as Barcino,
Catalun&shy;ya's founding as an in&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dent nation a thousand years ago
by the Visigoth <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_the_Hairy">Wilfred the Hairy</a>,
