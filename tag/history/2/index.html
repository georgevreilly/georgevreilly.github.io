<p>Tom Mus&shy;grave—&shy;Mas&shy;ter of Defence and Master of Logic, friend to Will Shake&shy;speare—is present at the very first per&shy;for&shy;mance of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>
when the actor playing Mercutio is somehow fatally stabbed
with an envenomed rapier during an on-stage duel.
He uncovers perfidy and poisonings
which stretches back for years and
rises into the highest halls of the land.</p>
<p>Tonkin has not only created a brilliant and dangerous pro&shy;tag&shy;o&shy;nist,
he has metic&shy;u&shy;lous&shy;ly recreated Eliz&shy;a&shy;bethan London,
a city that is a stew of ambition, peril, and intrigue.</p>

<p>This book fails both as a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_pastiches">Sherlock Holmes pastiche</a> and as an adventure.
The story is narrated by Watson,
but the pro&shy;tag&shy;o&shy;nist neither sounds nor acts much like Watson.
Holmes is elsewhere for much of the book and he is very annoying when present.
The plot is a pre&shy;pos&shy;ter&shy;ous mashup of steampunk and occult magick.</p>
<p>As in <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2015/05/06/ReviewTheSherlockian.html">The Sher&shy;lock&shy;ian</a>, this author does not have the skill
to write a convincing Holmes–Wat&shy;son novel.
I deducted another half star for the shoddy editing and the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_splice">comma splices</a>.</p>

<p>Pinkerton agent Frederick Chase arrives at Re&shy;ichen&shy;bach Falls
just after Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty have plunged to their deaths.
With Inspector Athelney Jones of Scotland Yard—&shy;sure&shy;ly one of Holmes's most ardent stu&shy;dents—he travels to London on the trail of an American master criminal, Clarence Devereaux.
De&shy;v&shy;ereaux's gang is moving quickly and ruthlessly
to seize control of the vacuum left by Moriarty.
But not all is it appears and the American gang receive bloody setbacks.
Could Moriarty be alive after all?</p>

<p>I just watched an in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing <a class="reference external" href="http://www.realmofhistory.com/2016/02/09/rome-the-eternal-city-in-its-peak-showcased-through-a-brilliantly-animated-video/">video</a> that recreates Rome as it probably was circa 320 AD.
At that point, Rome's population was somewhere between one and two million people,
the largest city in Europe until 19th century London.
Con&shy;stan&shy;tine was Emperor and a few years later,
he would move his capital to Con&shy;stan&shy;tino&shy;ple.
A century and a half later, the final emperors would die.</p>
<p>I've only visited Rome once, when I was ten years old.
I'm long overdue for another visit.</p>

<p>New Orleans, 1834.
Benjamin January is a free man of color
and a Paris-trained surgeon who must support himself as a musician.
His sister Olympe, a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Voodoo">voodooi&shy;enne</a>, and another woman, Célie,
are accused of murdering Célie's husband,
and Ben must save them from hanging.
As a pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al musician and a colored man,
Ben moves between the high society of the old French in&shy;hab&shy;i&shy;tants
and the new American merchants,
the poor white areas of town,
the many slaves,
and the small free black middle class.
Hambly adeptly explores slavery,

<p>London, January 1381.
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Gaunt">John of Gaunt</a>'s regency is in trouble,
unrest abounds throughout the land,
and uprisings are being plotted.
Brother Athelstan and his friend the Coroner
are invited to a per&shy;for&shy;mance by Gaunt's players, the Straw Men,
at the Tower of London.
When a murder occurs during the play, Athelstan is required to in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gate.
Several more murders happen before he finds the culprit.</p>
<p>Doherty pulls off both an intricate plot and a satisfying historical novel.</p>

When the beautiful wife of an ac&shy;quain&shy;tance is murdered,
Peter becomes involved in the in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion.
Meanwhile, Harriet is coming to terms with having &quot;married up&quot;,
after fending off Peter's wooing for several years.
Should she continue her career as a mystery novelist,
now that she no longer needs the income,
or do what is expected by some: have babies and give up writing.

<p>Red Ned Bedwell is an apprentice lawyer in Tudor London.
He's trying to fatten his purse by running the Christmas Revels for his fellow clerks,

The innocent is not nearly as naïve as his over&shy;bear&shy;ing mother believes
and Ned must follow his trail through the stews of London.</p>
