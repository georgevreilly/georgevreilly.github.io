<p>I don't watch much television.
One of the few shows that I do watch is <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters">Myth&shy;Busters</a>,
sadly now in its last season.
I watched three old shows tonight,
including one of my all-time favorites,
making a lead balloon.</p>
<p>Taking on the adage &quot;to go down like a lead balloon&quot;,
Jamie and Adam set out to prove that it is possible
to make a lead balloon fly.
But it's not easy.</p>
<p>After pro&shy;to&shy;typ&shy;ing a couple of designs with aluminum foil, they move on to lead foil.
Lead foil is very hard to obtain and it's much weaker than aluminum foil.
Jamie likens it to working with wet toilet paper,
as it's so easy to <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/02/08/MythBustersLeadBalloon.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.sherlock-seattle.org/">Sherlock Seattle</a> is a convention for fans of Sherlock Holmes,
in all his many in&shy;car&shy;na&shy;tions.
Emma and I are attending the 2015 convention this weekend at the Broadway Per&shy;for&shy;mance Hall.
We also attended the two previous con&shy;ven&shy;tions, in late 2012 and late 2013.
Holmes has always been popular,
since <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> wrote <em>A Study in Scarlet</em> in 1886.
Three recent adap&shy;ta&shy;tions have boosted Holmes' popularity con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;ably,
the steampunk <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_%282009_film%29">Sherlock films</a> with Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law;
the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_%28TV_series%29">BBC Sherlock</a> in modern-day London with Benedict Cum&shy;ber&shy;batch and Martin Freeman;
and the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_%28TV_series%29">CBS Elementary</a> in modern-day New York with Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu.</p>

    <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_the_Sheep"></a>
<p>By a serendip&shy;i&shy;tous accident poking around on the TiVo a few weeks ago,
we found that the Disney channel is broad&shy;cast&shy;ing <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_the_Sheep">Shaun the Sheep</a>.
It's a series of seven-minute shorts spun off from <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_and_Gromit">Wallace and Gromit</a>.</p>
<p>Shaun is the one smart sheep on a small&shy;hold&shy;ing.
His in&shy;quis&shy;i&shy;tive nature leads to all kinds of mischief.
The flock follow along;
the sheepdog sometimes helps, sometimes hinders.
All the while, the farmer is oblivious.
No dialog, just slapstick.
Highly rec&shy;om&shy;mend&shy;ed.</p>
<p>I learned today that a new 30-minute Wallace and Gromit,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wallaceandgromit.com/forum/read/20652/1">A Matter of Loaf and Death</a>, premieres on BBC TV at Christmas.
I'm not sure when it'll be shown in the US.

<p>Three years ago, one of our must-watch shows was
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/OnScreen/TVShows/FireWithin.htm">Fire Within</a>,
a doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary on the making of Cirque du Soleil's <em>Varekai</em> show.
It followed a set of would-be performers in the eight months leading up to
the premiere of <em>Varekai</em>, as they train at the Cirque's school in
Montreal, developing potential acts. Some of them make it, some fall by the
wayside.</p>
<p><em>Varekai</em> has been on tour ever since, and it just opened in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/varekai/TicketsGeneral/Seattle.htm">Seattle</a>.
We saw it tonight.
Very little of the original show survives;
mostly, the aerial strap act with the twins, Kevin and Andrew.</p>
<p>I recommend it. <em>Varekai</em> is a visual spec&shy;tac&shy;u&shy;lar,
with all the familiar elements of incredible <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/05/10/Varekai.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>Anyone who knows me, knows that I have no use for organized sports.
Watching baseball or basketball bores me. I seem to be con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly
incapable of being a sports fan. I'm too much of a watchful outsider to
want to throw myself into rooting for a team.</p>
<p>I actively despise American football. It reminds me far too much of the
rugby of my youth. I spent 11 years at an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stmaryscollegecssp.ie/">Irish rugger-bugger school</a>, so I come by it honestly.
The ugly jock culture that permeates football repels me. The veneration of
football in small-town America annoys me. The fans are obnoxious; the
players, thugs.</p>
<p>I exaggerate, of course. There <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/02/19/OlympicsRazorthinMargins.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Emma bought herself a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tivo.com/1.0.asp">TiVo Digital Video Recorder</a>
a few weeks ago. I had heard it said
that TiVo changes the way you watch TV. It's true. Emma is fond of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hgtv.com/">Home and Garden Television (HGTV)</a>,
which has a lot of shows about re&shy;dec&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ing and re&shy;mod&shy;el&shy;ling. They're padded
un&shy;mer&shy;ci&shy;ful&shy;ly, constantly recapping what they showed you before the most
recent break. She can work through an ostensible 30-minute show in under 10
minutes by skipping from highlight to highlight.</p>
<p>Our TiVo also has a DirecTV satellite receiver built in, giving us access
to far more stations than we had on <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/02/10/TiVo.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
