<p>When we moved to Beacon Hill in 2000,
we were totally dumb&shy;found&shy;ed by the number of kids
who came trick-or-treating to our door.
In the prior two years, we had been renting a house in Walling&shy;ford,
and we had only had one set of kids each year.</p>
<p>We had about 100 kids that first year.
We were not expecting the onslaught and ran out of candy,
which led to Emma being berated by some pre&shy;sump&shy;tu&shy;ous mother.
We live in a relatively affluent block
and kids are brought quite a distance to partake of the goodies.
One small boy peered up at Emma once and asked her, “Are you rich?”</p>

<p>We held our <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/07/08/HealthCareNowRallyOnThursday.html">rally</a> for healthcare and the public option at lunchtime,
outside the Jackson Federal Building
where both Senators Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray
have their Seattle offices.</p>
<p>Turnout was good: about 100 people, I'd say.
We had about half-a-dozen speakers over 45 minutes.
A cameraman from King–5 covered it, but I can't find anything on their website.
A handful of people went upstairs to the senators' offices
and delivered 291&nbsp;pages of petitions.</p>
<p>One concrete suggestion that I came away with
is to write a <em>hand&shy;writ&shy;ten</em> letter to the senators
advocating for healthcare reform.
Hand&shy;writ&shy;ten letters carry more weight than printed letters or calls
and much more weight than emails.</p>
<p>Do it soon.

Twenty acres of hills and valleys in a Japanese style.</p>
<p>Emma and I met Lyndol down there this morning
and rambled through the garden for two hours.
It was a fine, overcast day, with tem&shy;per&shy;a&shy;tures in the low 60s and occasional driz&shy;zle—and a pleasant relief from the record heat of earlier this week.
I had visited there before:
it's at the far end of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/transportation/chiefsealthtrail.htm">Chief Sealth bicycle trail</a>.

<p>For many years, I ignored the freeway sign for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rhodygarden.org/">Rhodo&shy;den&shy;dron Garden</a>
at exit 143 on I-5.
Five or six years ago, I visited the Rhody Garden
and I've gone back every spring since.</p>
<p>It's worth visiting at any time of year,
but from March to May or June, it's in bloom.
Twenty-two acres of rhodo&shy;den&shy;drons, azaleas, ferns, and other flowers,
near the Wey&shy;er&shy;hauser head&shy;quar&shy;ters in Federal Way, Washington.
There's a bonsai garden next door—un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly now closed to the public.
As you stroll along the shaded hilly paths,
you can almost make believe that the constant traffic noise
from the nearby freeway is running water.</p>

<p>I took today off and headed north to the Skagit Valley with Emma and Lyndol
to see the tulips.
It was a glorious spring day,
sunny, not too warm, a light breeze.
The tulip fields were busy for a weekday;
they're completely overrun at the weekends.</p>
<p>We wandered around <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tuliptown.com/">Tulip Town</a> for an hour,
had lunch in La Conner,
and headed back to Seattle via Camano Island.</p>
<p>We had intended to take <a class="reference external" href="http://www.byways.org/explore/byways/2579/stories/67281">Chuckanut Drive</a> up to Fairhaven,
but Emma wasn't feeling well.
Some other time.
Chuckanut Drive is pretty year round;
the tulips are good only for another couple of weeks.</p>

<p>I recently learned about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photophool/119574325/">string pods</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/coffeefromhell/sets/72157594215569637/">chain pods</a>.
In essence, they are pocket-sized monopods.
You screw a six-foot string into the tripod socket of your camera,
step on the other end of the string,
and pull it taut.
The tension on the string reduces camera shake.</p>

<p>About six weeks ago, I read about Sparky's <a class="reference external" href="http://codeforfood.org/2006/10/13/a-picture-a-day/">A Picture a Day</a> project
on his blog. He in turn had been inspired by Pho&shy;to&shy;jo&shy;jo's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.photojojo.com/content/tutorials/project-365-take-a-photo-a-day/">Project 365</a>.</p>
<p>Here's how it works, for me. I take at least one photo a day, every single
day for a year. Every so often, I upload the photos to <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/george_v_reilly/">my Flickr site</a>.
If I get more than one worthwhile photo in a day, great, but one and only
gets tagged <em>potd</em> (picture of the day).</p>
<p>Why? Apart from the reasons enumerated by Photojojo, here's what I get out
of it.</p>

<p>10/29. In mid-October, I shaved off the goatee that I had sported since March,
leaving me clean-shaven for the first time in a decade.
I quickly got over that urge and let the beard start growing back.</p>
<p>This is me at the two-week stage: a self-portrait taken while
ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ment&shy;ing with the new camera. It looks a little odd to me.
I'm using this as the startup photo on the camera.</p>
