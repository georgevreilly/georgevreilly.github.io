<p>My mid-2012 15&quot; MacBook Pro has been getting ever slower.
My last two work laptops came with SSDs, but this older machine has a 768GB hard disk drive.
It was time to get a solid-state drive, which are far more affordable now than four years ago.
Rather than replace the HDD, I bought a <a class="reference external" href="https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/internal_storage/Data_Doubler">Data Doubler</a> kit and a 480GB SSD.
I removed the optical drive and installed the Data Doubler with SSD in that space.
I rarely used the DVD drive, so I won't miss it.</p>
<p>The Data Doubler kit came with a set of screw&shy;drivers and
a detailed manual that covered multiple MacBook models.
The manual <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/07/03/SSDUpgradeFor2012MacBook.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>I got a new MacBook Pro on Monday:
a 13&quot; Retina with 16GB RAM and 500GB SSD,
which doubles both the RAM and the disk capacity
of its late-2013 pre&shy;de&shy;ces&shy;sor.
8GB wasn't really enough for software de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment.
By the time you run Chrome and PyCharm and Docker,
you don't have much RAM left.
And I was constantly having to run <a class="reference external" href="http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/">Grand Per&shy;spec&shy;tive</a>
to clean up disk space.</p>
<p>For the first time, I used the <a class="reference external" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204350">Migration Assistant</a> and a Thun&shy;der&shy;bolt cable
to transfer settings from the old laptop to the new.
I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.

    <p>When I upgraded my home and work MacBooks to
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_El_Capitan">OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)</a>,
the single biggest annoyance for me was that my external keyboards,
all <a class="reference external" href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000/b2m-00012">Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000</a>s,
no longer swapped the Alt &amp; Windows key.</p>


<p>By default, when a PC keyboard is plugged into a Mac,
the Alt key,
which is im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly to the left of the spacebar,
is mapped to the Alt/Option key,
which is two keys left of the spacebar on a Mac keyboard.
And the Windows key,
which is two keys to the left of the spacebar on a PC keyboard,
is mapped to the Command key,
which is next to the spacebar on a Mac keyboard.</p>

<p>Every few years, I find it necessary to wipe my computers
and do a clean install of the operating system.
As a developer and a power user, I install a lot of software.
The cumulative effect of in&shy;stal&shy;la&shy;tions and upgrades
is to leave a lot of cruft on the machines.
Entropy increases and the machines grow slower and perhaps less reliable.
So I like to wipe the hard disk, install a new operating system,
and reinstall only those apps that I know I need.</p>
<p>My mid-2012 MacBook Pro came with OS X 10.7.
Shortly thereafer, 10.8 was released and I promptly upgraded; likewise with 10.9.

<p>I tried Safari 4 on my MacBook back in February when it first came out in beta.
It <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/02/25/Safari4FAIL.html">crashed im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly, every time</a>, so I unin&shy;stalled it.</p>
<p>I upgraded to OS X 10.5.7 earlier in the week and new Safari bits were available,
so it seemed like a good time to retry it.
After all, it had been faster than any other browser on my Vista box at work.</p>
<p>Again, it crashed im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly.
This time, however, I took a closer look at the details of the
error report that was being sent to Apple.
A little Googling suggested that the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.machangout.com/">Glims</a> plugin was at fault.
Indeed it was.

I created two 25GB partitions with the intention of

It turns out that BootCamp doesn't like that.
It wants the system drive to have only one partition,
