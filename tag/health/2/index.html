    <p>At our Sixth Day of Christmas party yesterday, Delf started talking
about burns from hot peppers, which reminded me of a crazy thread
that I read a while back, <a class="reference external" href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/006812.html">Listening to habeneros</a>,
and of a sure-fire cure for hiccups from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.owlsprings.com/">Diane Duane</a>.</p>
<p>Me, when I get hiccups,
I just take a very deep breath and hold it for as long as I can.
If it doesn't work the first time, it does on the second attempt.</p>
<p>Cure #1, letting a large spoonful of sugar dissolve in the mouth,
is the only cure that's ever worked for Emma.</p>
<p>Here's Diane Duane on <a class="reference external" href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/006812.html#95991">curing hiccups</a>:</p>

<p>I have gout. It's an unpleasant form of arthritis. Once or twice a year,
one of my lower joints will swell up overnight. Usually, it's struck one of
my knees, though the last few attacks have all been in my feet. The knee
attacks have all been extremely painful initially and I've required
pre­scrip­tion painkillers to get to sleep at night. Just bending my knee a
few degrees is enough to make me break out in a cold sweat. For­tu­nate­ly,
after a few days, the pain decreases to the point where it's annoying but
tolerable.</p>
<p>Oddly, the feet <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/10/11/Gout.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I gave the following speech to Toast­mas­ters on March 5th, 2003, as Speech
#3, "Organize Your Speech".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SLEEP APNEA</p>
<p>My wife is a cyborg.</p>
<p>That's not to say that she's the Terminator. Nor even that she's the
six-million dollar woman, although I do value her greatly. She calls
herself a cyborg because she sleeps with a breathing machine. At night,
she wears a mask over her nose to force air into her lungs.</p>
<p>When I first met her, she complained of being tired all the time, of
not getting a good night's sleep, of feeling stupid. When she drove <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/04/24/SleepApnea.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>I've been too busy in the last few weeks to post anything here. Mostly
because I've been busy with work. Partially because I'm too disgusted with
Iraq to say anything useful: Win the war and lose the peace. Feh!</p>
<p>In the last few days, I've been at home taking care of Emma. On Friday
morning, she had a Morton's neuroma removed from her left foot. A nerve
running through the space between a couple of her toes had become enlarged
to about a centimeter in diameter, and it had been causing her a lot of
pain. She <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/04/22/HerLeftFoot.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
