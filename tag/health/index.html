    <p>I've been using a <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2017/01/17/KneeWalker.html">knee walker</a> for the last couple of weeks.
For the first time, I took public trans­porta­tion by myself
to attend <a class="reference external" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/236557338/">Papers We Love</a> tonight.
I rolled myself from 1st Ave S & Washington up to the Pioneer Square station,
took the Light Rail one stop north to the University Street station at 3rd & Seneca,
then rolled down the hill to 2nd & Spring.
It's a trip I wouldn't have thought about twice if I were walking nor­mal­ly—and I probably would have walked the entire way
rather than take the Light Rail only one short stop.</p>
<p>It's a different matter on a knee scooter.

<p>I had a <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/03/23/MoleRemoval.html">mole excised</a> from my lower calf three weeks ago,
after a biopsy found that it was “abnormal”.
The biopsy on the excised remainder came back clean.
I went back to the surgeon's office during the week to have the stitches removed.
It turns out that the stitches were dis­solv­able,
but I hadn't peeled back the wrapping to take a look.
I was given the all-clear to resume exercising
and for the rest of the week, I cycled to the office.
Today was my first run:
a 3-mile course to the Seward Park Caffè Vita.
The scar didn't bother me, but I had to stop and walk a <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/04/17/RunningAfterStitches.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>I had a mole excised today.</p>
<p>I have a few moles on my body, mostly on my legs.
My doctor has disliked the look of some of my moles for years.
After my most recent annual physical,
I went to see a der­ma­tol­o­gist a month ago.
There was only one mole that she wanted to treat,
low on my left calf.
She took a biopsy,
using a tiny little saw to peel the top layer off
after the area had been numbed with a local anesthetic.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>The results came back a week later.
The mole was “abnormal” but not cancerous.
It was rec­om­mend­ed that the rest be removed.

<blockquote>
<p>In an interview with MSNBC Friday,
2016 Democratic pres­i­den­tial candidate Hillary Clinton said
that Ronald and Nancy Reagan helped start a national con­ver­sa­tion about HIV/AIDS.
This is not exactly a bald-faced lie,
but it is a gross mis­un­der­stand­ing of history
and a mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion of the true gov­ern­men­tal neglect
during the AIDS epidemic that killed millions worldwide.</p>

<p>As I wrote on Facebook earlier today:</p>

I'm really surprised by this.
I expected Hillary Clinton to know better.
It's one thing not to speak ill of the dead at their funeral.
It's quite another to make such a profoundly wrong assertion.

<blockquote>
<p>The basic idea is that [the chron­i­cal­ly ill] have a limited number of spoons
available for the day and each action will cost a given number of them
– the more demanding the task, the more spoons would be required.
The phrase "running low on spoons" can be a useful way
of com­mu­ni­cat­ing the need for rest</p>

<p>I see this sometime with Emma:
her various illnesses and sen­si­tiv­i­ties catch up with her
and she has little capacity to get things done for a few days.
At other times, such as today,
she has quite a reasonable amount of energy or “spoons”.</p>

I had my eyes tested last month and there is a small change in the pre­scrip­tion.
I've had my current glasses for about six years.</p>

but then in the space of just a few months,
I developed the classic problem of middle age:
it became hard for me to read.
I got a pair of glasses with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.allaboutvision.com/lenses/progressives.htm">pro­gres­sive</a> lenses.

I visited my US Senators' offices, with a handful of others,
to help stiffen their spines on healthcare reform.</p>
<p>It started by accident last night when Mira mentioned on Facebook
that she was going to visit Rep. Jim McDermott, Sen. Maria Cantwell,
and Sen. Patty Murray's Seattle offices today
to talk to them about the “public option”.</p>
<p>McDermott and Murray were already supporters of the public health insurance option.
Cantwell's position was murkier and she came out in favor of
some kind of lame “co-op” compromise earlier this week.
