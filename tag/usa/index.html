<p>I have an ambivalent relation to the notion of patriotism
because all too often those who most loudly proclaim themselves to be patriots
are the worst sort of jingoistic, know-nothing, blowhard&shy;s—be they Trump supporters, Brexiters, or Irish na&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ists.</p>
<p>And yet, for all the flaws and failures of the American Experiment,
there are still things to celebrate.
America's optimism and can-do spirit,
although much abraded in recent years, is still exemplary.
Millions continue to flock here, drawn to the land of op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ty.
The Founding Fathers created a great and lasting democracy,
albeit with a franchise and a set of rights that had to be widened several times.

    <p>Today is Martin Luther King Day,
a day that honors the legacy of a great American.
It's a Federal Holiday, but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2015/01/only_37_of_employers_give_off.html">only 37% of employers give off Martin Luther King Day</a>.
Apparently, 37% is an all-time high for MLK Day
and it's also higher than the other three holidays
that most Americans don't get,
Pres&shy;i&shy;dents' Day, Columbus Day [sic], and Veterans' Day.</p>
<p>I've worked in America for a quarter century,
but it was only at the first job,
when I was a Brown University employee,
that I got those secondary Federal holidays off.</p>
<p>Not only is America one of the least-generous countries for vacation days,

<p>Of all the major American holidays,
Memorial Day and Labor Day are the most divorced from their ostensible meanings.
To most peo&shy;ple—my&shy;self in&shy;clud&shy;ed—they are little more than the brackets of summer,
three-day weekends of barbecues and sun.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day">Memorial Day</a> com&shy;mem&shy;o&shy;rates U.S. men and women who died in military service.
I don't think I know anyone who actually observes that,
including Emma, a USAF veteran.
If I knew some military families, I might think otherwise.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www1.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetday_faq.asp">Veterans Day</a> (November 11th) honors <em>all</em> veterans,

<p>On the 9th or 10th of January 1989, I flew from Dublin to New York.
That was the last day that I ever lived in Ireland.</p>
<p>I came to the U.S. on a tourist visa.
It was no lie.
I had a round-the-world ticket and I would go on to Australia in early March.
In June, I left Australia and traveled to Bangkok and Hong Kong.
Sometime in July, I landed back in Ireland to settle up my affairs.
I fit in a trip to the South of France with some old friends.</p>
<p>In August, I would return to America to attend graduate school.

By accident.</p>
<p>I was on my first solo trip to the United States,
having arrived in New York the previous week.
There I had purchased a 30-day unlimited standby ticket with Delta.
It cost me only $400, as I could produce my round-the-world ticket.</p>
<p>For no par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly good reason, I decided to start
the 30 days with a trip to Washington DC.
There were museums there and it was nearby.</p>
<p>I hadn't been paying close attention to the news, and
it was only when I got to Washington that I realized that

<p>My first Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing took place nineteen years ago.
I was a 24-year-old graduate student,
recently arrived at Brown.
One of my of&shy;fice&shy;mates and her husband insisted
that I and a Swedish grad student
accompany them to her parents' house for Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing dinner.
It snowed that day, the first snow of the winter.
We set off in what seemed like a blizzard,
up I-95 into Mass&shy;a&shy;chu&shy;setts.
The day was cold, but the reception was warm.
A houseful of Patrice's relatives made us most welcome.</p>
<p>Ever since, I've always sat down to
a large, convivial dinner at Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing.
At first, others welcomed me into their homes.

<p>Fellow Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters and Guests, last September, on the first

<p>Like many of you, I am an immigrant. I have spent most of my adult life

earn a Masters degree. I moved to Seattle in 1992, the same year that I
