<p>The defining issue of our time is not the Iraq war. It is not the
&quot;global war on terror.&quot; It is not our inability (or un&shy;will&shy;ing&shy;ness) to
ensure that all Americans have access to affordable health care. Nor is
it im&shy;mi&shy;gra&shy;tion, out&shy;sourc&shy;ing, or growing income inequity. It is not
education, it is not global warming, and it is not Social Security.</p>
<p>The defining issue of our time is the media.</p>
<p>The dominant political force of our time is not Karl Rove or the

<p>Amy Sullivan has a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0605.sullivan1.html">piece in the Washington Monthly</a>
about the little-sung successes of the Democrats.</p>
<p>Apparently, there is some strategy and co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;na&shy;tion going on in the
Democratic leadership, despite what the press might lead you to believe.
The Dubai ports deal blew up because Schumer kept calling press con&shy;fer&shy;ences
about it, though Schumer has hardly been credited with lobbing the grenade.
Murtha was not left out in the cold by Pelosi and other Dems; it was a
deliberate strategy to prevent him being labeled as a token hawk.
And the Dems managed to kill Bush's pri&shy;va&shy;ti&shy;za&shy;tion of Social Security,
by dis&shy;ci&shy;plined attacks on Bush's &quot;risky&quot; proposal. Their not <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/05/16/NotAsLameAsYouThink.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

Russ Baker ably takes the MSM to task:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When, oh when, will the U.S. “main&shy;stream media” finally stop hemming and
hawing, parsing and un&shy;der&shy;stat&shy;ing? When will they simply go for the jugular
to confirm what any thoughtful American has already learned from “less
reputable” but in&shy;creas&shy;ing&shy;ly relevant al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tive in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion sources: that
from the beginning of the Bush ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion, invading Iraq has always
been as much an article of faith for the president as, well, promoting
faith over reason?</p>

while the memo had previously been reported, it had never been as fully
