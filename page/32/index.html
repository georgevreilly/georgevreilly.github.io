<p>I grew up hating rugby.
I spent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2006/02/19/OlympicsRazorthinMargins.aspx">eleven years</a> at a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's_College,_Dublin">rugger-bugger school</a> in Dublin.
I couldn't stand the game.
I was a small, unathletic child with no interest in sports.
Rugby, even the modified rugby that they teach seven-year-olds,
was violent and unpleasant and involved running around cold, wet fields.
I had a big operation on my feet when I was 10
and I parlayed that into an excuse never to play rugby again.</p>
<p>I can't remember when I last watched a rugby match,
but it was surely back in the '80s,
as I doubt I've seen one over the 20 years that I've been in the States.</p>
<p>So imagine <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/21/RugbyGrandSlam.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>DI John Rebus in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gates the murder of an illegal immigrant,
who had ties to asylum seekers in Edinburgh.
DS Siobhan Clarke looks into the dis&shy;ap&shy;pear&shy;ance of a teenaged girl;
soon, the rapist of the girl's sister is murdered.</p>
<p>Rebus and Siobhan struggle with the uglier side of life in Edinburgh,
notably, racism, latter-day slavery, and the increasing numbers of asylum seekers.
As usual, their personal lives are in a mess:
Rebus drinks too much;
Siobhan falls asleep with a tub of ice cream.</p>
<p>As in other <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/12/24/ReviewResurrectionMen.aspx">Rebus books</a>, the two in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tions end up

<p>We discovered <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bistrotbistro.com/">Bistrot Bistro</a> in Kitsilano on a previous visit to Vancouver.
It's an agreeable little French restaurant just south of downtown.
Emma suggested that we eat there again for my birthday,
and it was a fine choice.</p>
<p>We ate from the <em>prix fixe</em> menu for $26 apiece.
She had the carrot soup, roast chicken, and raspberry sorbet;
I had the <em>pate de campagne</em>, a peppercorn steak, and a chocolate mousse.
The <em>prix fixe</em> included a sizeable quantity of <em>pommes frites</em>.
We added Brussel sprouts, a baguette with olive tapenade,
and a half-litre of Pinot Gris,
and walked away two hours later, pleasantly sated.</p>

<p>We drove up to Vancouver today.
We'll be here until Tuesday.
It's my birthday tomorrow and
I have two days of vacation that I have to use by the end of March or lose them,
so why not.</p>
<p>I always like Vancouver.
It's un&shy;equiv&shy;o&shy;cal&shy;ly a major city.
Vancouver feels more urban than Seattle,
where people have only been moving into high-density
downtown condos and apartments for a few years.</p>
<p>We're staying at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sunsetinn.com/">Sunset Inn and Suites</a> in the West End.
We stayed here before.
It's relatively cheap, clean, and centrally located.
No particular charm either.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we see my great-uncle Dick and his wife Margaret.

<p>Bay Tanner is a young widow and aspiring private in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tor
from wealthy South Carolina stock.
When a hitherto unknown <a class="reference external" href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-shi5.htm">shirt-tail</a> cousin (fifth half cousin, specif&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly)
bursts into Bay's life, she brings havoc in her train.</p>
<p>As one of the characters says,
the plot sounds like a made-for-TV movie.
Still, Bay is a feisty heroine and
the background is not one that has been mined deeply.</p>

<p>We saw <em>The Seafarer</em> at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattlereptickets.org/Plays/0809/SF/">Seattle Rep</a> this afternoon.
Two brothers, Richard and Sharkey, share a house in north Dublin.
There's little love lost between them.
Richard, recently blinded, is con&shy;trol&shy;ling and wheedling.
Sharkey is trying to stay off the gargle
and it's not easy when Richard and his crony Ivan drink like fishes.</p>
<p>Sharkey's old rival, Nicky, arrives on Christmas Eve,
bringing a stranger with him, Mr. Lockhart.
They settle down to a game of poker
and Sharkey privately learns that he's met the stranger once before.
For Mr. Lockhart is the devil and he wants to collect the old debt
that Sharkey owes <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/09/ReviewTheSeafarer.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I knew three of my grand&shy;par&shy;ents; they all died after I reached adulthood.
My mother's father, George Victor Clery, died 12 days before I was born,
on March 3rd, 1965.
I was to be named Vincent after my father, [Charles] Vincent Reilly.
Instead, I was christened George Vincent Reilly.
I was the first grandchild for both the Clerys and the Reillys.
I think I must have been a welcome dis&shy;trac&shy;tion.</p>
<p>Ironically, my parents had gotten married on his birthday,
March 30th, the previous year,
and he didn't live to celebrate their first an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
The timing was partly in his honor
and partly because it was Easter Monday.

<p>One thing that's been bugging me since I started using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/01/22/UsingOpera.aspx">Opera</a>
is that <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text was showing as normal text in my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/">personal blog</a>.
Yet other browsers were correctly displaying bold and italic on my blog.</p>
<p>I'm still not entirely sure why Mac Opera had a problem with it,
but I fixed it by using the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brownbatterystudios.com/sixthings/2007/03/14/lucida-hybrid-the-grande-alternative/">Lucida Hybrid</a> stylesheet tweak.</p>
<p>I adjusted a few other things while I was at it.
The most obvious is that the font size is larger.</p>
<p>Most RSS readers won't pick up the stylesheet,
so take a look at the actual <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/">blog</a>.</p>

<p>Esther Schindler has a post about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.javaworld.com/community/node/2500">in&shy;ter&shy;view&shy;ing your next boss</a>:
should a candidate dev manager meet everyone who'll be reporting to them?</p>
<p>Yes. Definitely.
If you want a successful, cohesive team,
there has to be trust.
A manager can make or break a team.</p>
<p>A new manager starts at a dis&shy;ad&shy;van&shy;tage,
relative to a new individual con&shy;trib&shy;u&shy;tor.
The new dev is expected to ramp up
and have time to build re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ships with the team.
The new manager has to build the re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ships as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If the manager gets to interview with the team
before being offered the job,
both parties benefit.
Why would you want to manage a team that you'd never <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/02/26/InterviewingYourNextBoss.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Apple launched the public <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=19&amp;entry_id=36185">Safari 4 beta</a> today.</p>
<p>It runs beau&shy;ti&shy;ful&shy;ly on Vista and it's the fastest browser that I've seen,
noticeably faster than Chrome.
Everything that I tried worked fairly well;
I saw only a few minor glitches.</p>
<p>I installed it on my MacBook at home this evening.
It crashes at startup every time that I attempt to run it.
For&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, it comes with an unin&shy;staller so that I could revert to Safari 3.21.</p>
