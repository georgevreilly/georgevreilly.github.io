<p>A paedophile chained up an eight-year-old boy's parents,
then took the boy and killed him.
DI Jack Caffery finds the case par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly stressful:
his brother was abducted and never found when they were boys.
His girlfriend is falling apart too.</p>
<p>Part thriller, part psy&shy;cho&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal study, part police procedural.
Hayder ratchets up the tension
as the internal and external pressures on Caffery grow.</p>
<p>Rec&shy;om&shy;mend&shy;ed.</p>

<p>The California Supreme Court handed down their decision about Propo&shy;si&shy;tion&nbsp;8 today:
they're letting it stand.
No new gay marriages, though the 18,000 same-sex marriages
that were enacted last year remain valid.</p>
<p>It's a setback to be sure.
The silver lining is that the gay community has been fired up
since Propo&shy;si&shy;tion&nbsp;8 passed in November.</p>
<p>There's a small but real danger that <a class="reference external" href="http://eqfed.org/campaign/DeclineToSignPet_71">Referendum 71</a>
will make it on to the ballot here in Washington state.
It would roll back the everything-but-marriage domestic part&shy;ner&shy;ship law
that passed recently.</p>

<p>I saw <em>Terribly Happy</em> at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.siff.net/festival/film/detail.aspx?id=28859&amp;fid=123">SIFF</a> tonight.</p>
<p>Robert is a Copenhagen cop, demoted to a remote village in the bleak bogs of Jutland.
The locals are clannish and do things their own way.
Robert quickly finds himself coming between
the man-hungry Ingerlise and her abusive husband Jørgen.
She complains about Jørgen, but won't swear out a formal report.
Robert is un&shy;will&shy;ing&shy;ly drawn to her.</p>
<p>Billed as a “blackly comic thriller”, it's more of a psy&shy;cho&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal drama.
Robert's unsmiling face carries the film.</p>

<p>Of all the major American holidays,
Memorial Day and Labor Day are the most divorced from their ostensible meanings.
To most peo&shy;ple—my&shy;self in&shy;clud&shy;ed—they are little more than the brackets of summer,
three-day weekends of barbecues and sun.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www1.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetday_faq.asp">Veterans Day</a> (November 11th) honors <em>all</em> veterans,

<p><em>The Last Light of the Sun</em> takes place in the Dark Ages of a parallel world.
The Erlings (Vikings) raid the Cyngael (Welsh) and Anglcyn (Anglo-Saxon).
A young Erling flees indentured servitude and becomes a raider,
following in the footsteps of his estranged father.
A Cyngael prince dies in an Erling raid and is taken by the Queen of the Fairies;
his brother is drawn to another fairy;
he will enter into a reluctant compact with the Anglcyn when they are raided by the Erling.</p>

<p>Nine years ago, the Ryan Commission was set up to produce
a report on physical, emotional, and sexual abuse of children
in Catholic Church–run re&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;to&shy;ries in Ireland.
This week, they released a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/europe/21ireland.html">2600-page report</a>
detailing abuse to tens of thousands of children from the 1930s to the 1990s.
The abuse and violence were systemic and in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ized, if not universal,
and they were hushed up and overlooked for decades.
The stories of the abused, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0523/1224247210382.html">in their own words</a>, make for horrifying reading.

<p>I initially learned to drive on the left in Ireland,
but have spent the last 20 years driving on the right in the States.
I personally never had any difficulty switching from one side to the oth&shy;er—ex&shy;cept when extremely jet&shy;lagged—but I know several people who find it enormously stressful.
I find it easy enough to orient myself so that the lane divider is at the correct position.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, my father often brought his Irish car
over to mainland Europe on the car ferries.
A right-hand drive car driving on the right is doubly tricky.
It didn't seem to bother him too much, but <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/05/21/DrivingOnTheOtherSideOfTheRoad.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>For many years, I ignored the freeway sign for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rhodygarden.org/">Rhodo&shy;den&shy;dron Garden</a>
at exit 143 on I-5.
Five or six years ago, I visited the Rhody Garden
and I've gone back every spring since.</p>
<p>It's worth visiting at any time of year,
but from March to May or June, it's in bloom.
Twenty-two acres of rhodo&shy;den&shy;drons, azaleas, ferns, and other flowers,
near the Wey&shy;er&shy;hauser head&shy;quar&shy;ters in Federal Way, Washington.
There's a bonsai garden next door—un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly now closed to the public.
As you stroll along the shaded hilly paths,
you can almost make believe that the constant traffic noise
from the nearby freeway is running water.</p>

<p>A conman publisher visits a writing circle in Chichester
and gets their hopes up.
Soon, he is burned to death in his cottage.
Other arson-murders follow.</p>
<p>In the first half of the book, the story is primarily told
from the viewpoint of the newest member of the writers' circle, Bob Naylor,
who starts in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gat&shy;ing, egged on by some of the others.
In the second half, it becomes a police procedural,
as seen by Detective Chief Inspector Henrietta Mallin,
who takes over the case.</p>
<p><em>The Circle</em> is a whodunnit in the classic vein,
