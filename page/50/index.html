<p>I gave the following speech to Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters on January 29th, 2003, as Speech #2, &quot;Sincerity&quot;.</p>

<p>NAT&shy;U&shy;RAL&shy;IZA&shy;TION</p>
<p>Fellow Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters and Guests, last September, on the first
an&shy;niver&shy;sary of 9/11, I made one of the biggest decisions of my life: I
decided to apply for American cit&shy;i&shy;zen&shy;ship, to become nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;ized.</p>
<p>Like many of you, I am an immigrant. I have spent most of my adult life
in this country. Fourteen years ago, I came to the US from Ireland to
earn a Masters degree. I moved to Seattle in 1992, the same year that I
became a permanent resident. I <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/05/16/Naturalization.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

#3, &quot;Organize Your Speech&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SLEEP APNEA</p>
<p>My wife is a cyborg.</p>
<p>That's not to say that she's the Terminator. Nor even that she's the
six-million dollar woman, although I do value her greatly. She calls
herself a cyborg because she sleeps with a breathing machine. At night,
she wears a mask over her nose to force air into her lungs.</p>
<p>When I first met her, she complained of being tired all the time, of
not getting a good night's sleep, of feeling stupid. When she drove <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/04/24/SleepApnea.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>I've been too busy in the last few weeks to post anything here. Mostly
because I've been busy with work. Partially because I'm too disgusted with
Iraq to say anything useful: Win the war and lose the peace. Feh!</p>
<p>In the last few days, I've been at home taking care of Emma. On Friday
morning, she had a Morton's neuroma removed from her left foot. A nerve
running through the space between a couple of her toes had become enlarged
to about a centimeter in diameter, and it had been causing her a lot of
pain. She <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/04/22/HerLeftFoot.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Emma got this list of &quot;why did the chicken cross the road?&quot; jokes off one
of her mailing lists. I've seen most of these before, but some are new, and
I can't find this selection on Google.</p>

<p>Almost, but not quite, at war with Iraq. Saddam has forty-eight hours to
quit Iraq and avert war, but no-one expects him to do that. Feh.</p>
<p>I would feel slightly better about the new war if Bush had managed to forge
a broad-based coalition. Instead, in their heavy&shy;hand&shy;ed way, Bush, Rumsfeld,
Cheney, and Perle have managed to piss off most of the world.</p>

probably thousands more at the other vigils in the Seattle area.</p>
