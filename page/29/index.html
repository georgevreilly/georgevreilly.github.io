<p>We saw <em>The Seafarer</em> at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattlereptickets.org/Plays/0809/SF/">Seattle Rep</a> this afternoon.
Two brothers, Richard and Sharkey, share a house in north Dublin.
There's little love lost between them.
Richard, recently blinded, is con&shy;trol&shy;ling and wheedling.
Sharkey is trying to stay off the gargle
and it's not easy when Richard and his crony Ivan drink like fishes.</p>
<p>Sharkey's old rival, Nicky, arrives on Christmas Eve,
bringing a stranger with him, Mr. Lockhart.
They settle down to a game of poker
and Sharkey privately learns that he's met the stranger once before.
For Mr. Lockhart is the devil and he wants to collect the old debt
that Sharkey owes <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog//Users/georger/website/gvr-blog-acrylamid/content/blog/2009/03/09/seafarer.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>One thing that's been bugging me since I started using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/01/22/UsingOpera.aspx">Opera</a>
is that <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text was showing as normal text in my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/">personal blog</a>.
Yet other browsers were correctly displaying bold and italic on my blog.</p>
<p>I'm still not entirely sure why Mac Opera had a problem with it,
but I fixed it by using the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brownbatterystudios.com/sixthings/2007/03/14/lucida-hybrid-the-grande-alternative/">Lucida Hybrid</a> stylesheet tweak.</p>
<p>I adjusted a few other things while I was at it.
The most obvious is that the font size is larger.</p>
<p>Most RSS readers won't pick up the stylesheet,
so take a look at the actual <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/">blog</a>.</p>

<p>Esther Schindler has a post about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.javaworld.com/community/node/2500">in&shy;ter&shy;view&shy;ing your next boss</a>:
should a candidate dev manager meet everyone who'll be reporting to them?</p>
<p>Yes. Definitely.
If you want a successful, cohesive team,
there has to be trust.
A manager can make or break a team.</p>
<p>A new manager starts at a dis&shy;ad&shy;van&shy;tage,
relative to a new individual con&shy;trib&shy;u&shy;tor.
The new dev is expected to ramp up
and have time to build re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ships with the team.
The new manager has to build the re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ships as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If the manager gets to interview with the team
before being offered the job,
both parties benefit.
Why would you want to manage a team that you'd never <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog//Users/georger/website/gvr-blog-acrylamid/content/blog/2009/02/26/interview-boss.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Apple launched the public <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=19&amp;entry_id=36185">Safari 4 beta</a> today.</p>
<p>It runs beau&shy;ti&shy;ful&shy;ly on Vista and it's the fastest browser that I've seen,
noticeably faster than Chrome.
Everything that I tried worked fairly well;
I saw only a few minor glitches.</p>
<p>I installed it on my MacBook at home this evening.
It crashes at startup every time that I attempt to run it.
For&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, it comes with an unin&shy;staller so that I could revert to Safari 3.21.</p>
<p>Back to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/01/22/UsingOpera.aspx">Opera</a> for now.</p>

I certainly pro&shy;cras&shy;ti&shy;nate.</p>
<p>Sometimes my pro&shy;cras&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion is tantamount to
making sure that my pencils are very, very sharp.
More often, I find myself surfing the web,
free as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;at&shy;ing off in random directions.
There's no end to the fas&shy;ci&shy;nat&shy;ing dis&shy;trac&shy;tions.</p>
<p>In lesser cases, I pro&shy;cras&shy;ti&shy;nate because I'm bored
or not fully engaged in what I'm doing.</p>
<p>When I have a more severe case,
I think fear is the root cause.
I don't really know how to proceed,
I don't really understand what it is that I'm supposed to be doing,
and I don't really want to come to grips with it.

<p>Clint Eastwood directs himself as Walt Kowalski,

Newly widowed, estranged from his sons,

Walt is a bitter, racist old bastard.</p>
<p>He doesn't like the Hmong immigrants who live next door
and he nearly shoots the teenage boy, Thao,
when he catches Thao trying to steal his beloved 1972 Gran Torino.
The theft was to be the reluctant Thao's gang initiation.
The gang come by to punish Thao and Walt runs the “gooks” off his lawn at gunpoint.
The Hmong neighbors start bringing over food and flowers in gratitude.

<p>For a long time, I disliked Facebook.
It seemed to consist entirely of annoying ac&shy;quain&shy;tances
attacking me with vampires or sending me pointless “gifts”.</p>
<p>I've used Facebook more in the last month
and it's been less annoying than I remembered it.
I check it once or twice a day and see updates
from people I know.
More en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing than ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ing.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/georgevreilly">Twitter</a>, though, has not clicked for me.
Brevity is good, but Twitter is too minimalist.
Stream-of-con&shy;scious&shy;ness ejac&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tions.
Opaque URLs disdaining ex&shy;pla&shy;na&shy;tion.
Feh.</p>
