    <p>I finally updated my blog to run on dasBlog 1.8.
Not too painful.
I unzipped the binary dis&shy;tri&shy;b&shy;u&shy;tion,
downloaded the content folder from my server to my local drive,
ran the provided upgrade utility,
and used WinMerge to update the con&shy;fig&shy;u&shy;ra&shy;tion files.</p>
<p>The most obvious change is that I'm using a new theme (skin),
which gives the site a very different look.
The previous default theme had problems if your browser window was too narrow,
due to some hardcoded table sizes (I think).</p>
<p>I also figured out how to post to dasBlog via w.bloggar.
I looked for info on con&shy;fig&shy;ur&shy;ing w.bloggar a few weeks ago, and couldn't find it then.</p>

    <p>Last weekend, we made good progress on the basement.
On Saturday, Dale and Ernest helped us out, doing some demolition
in the basement, and bringing loads to Goodwill and to the dump
in their truck.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Jill and Delf helped us clean the remaining stuff
out of the basement. Louise excavated a hole outside the window
that we're going to enlarge. Deb, currently <em>hors de combat</em>
with a pinched nerve, dropped by to provide moral support,
as did Frank and Lyndol. Delf spent nearly twelve hours with us that day,
and thanks to his experience in con&shy;struc&shy;tion, he and I built
framing around the furnace.</p>

<p>On Labor Day, Emma and I thoroughly cleaned out the garage in the alley,

    <p>I learned a really clever trick at our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2005/09/14/KatrinaEvacueesWorkPartiesAndScalingBack.aspx">workparty</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p>We were using a dolly that we had borrowed from our neighbor Mary
to haul a heavy credenza up from the basement.
One of the tires was flat, which made the exercise even more difficult.</p>
<p>I got out my bicycle floor pump and started pumping,
but it was a waste of time.
The tire was tubeless and without any air,
so it just slipped loosely around the rim.
After a few minutes of futility,
Dale remembered something he had seen years before at a gas station.</p>
<p>He got a bowl of soapy water and a sponge,
and coated the metal <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog//Users/georger/website/gvr-blog-acrylamid/content/blog/2005/09/14/soaping-up-a-flat-tire.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

College. Today, we started on per&shy;spec&shy;tive. We began by watching a
45-minute <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cloudband.com/frames.mhtml/magazine/articles/rev_dinwiddie_surface_0699.html">video by David Hockney</a>, where he contrasts three paintings:
a Canaletto painting of Venice, and two Chinese scrolls painted
70 years apart.</p>
<p>The Canaletto is a classic <a class="reference external" href="http://drawsketch.about.com/library/weekly/aa021603c.htm">two-point linear per&shy;spec&shy;tive</a> painting.
Both of the Chinese scrolls show trips by the emperor along the
Grand Canal. The first one, by Wang Hui, is 27 inches high and 72 feet wide!
It uses multiple per&shy;spec&shy;tive to show scenes, in a manner
that is strange to my Western eyes. Hockney demon&shy;strates how
effective it is. For example, he shows a corner <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog//Users/georger/website/gvr-blog-acrylamid/content/blog/2005/07/20/hockney-chinese-perspective.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
