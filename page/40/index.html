    <p>Anyone who knows me, knows that I have no use for organized sports.
Watching baseball or basketball bores me. I seem to be con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly
incapable of being a sports fan. I'm too much of a watchful outsider to
want to throw myself into rooting for a team.</p>
<p>I actively despise American football. It reminds me far too much of the
rugby of my youth. I spent 11 years at an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stmaryscollegecssp.ie/">Irish rugger-bugger school</a>, so I come by it honestly.
The ugly jock culture that permeates football repels me. The veneration of
football in small-town America annoys me. The fans are obnoxious; the
players, thugs.</p>
<p>I exaggerate, of course. There <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog//Users/georger/website/gvr-blog-acrylamid/content/blog/2006/02/19/olympics.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>Back in October, I joined Atlas Solutions as a senior software engineer.
The company just held its first &quot;partner summit&quot;,
to educate some of our key partners
on the kind of work we're doing and new de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ments.
An attendee <a class="reference external" href="http://lindaburlison.blogspot.com/2006/02/atlas-partner-summit.html">blogged</a> it.
I'm working on video on demand, the stuff that Scott Ferris talked about.</p>
<p>I saw some of the pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tions being rehearsed last week,
but a lot of this is stuff that I've never seen before.
I come from a software background, after all, not an ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ing background.</p>

    <p>At our Sixth Day of Christmas party yesterday, Delf started talking
about burns from hot peppers, which reminded me of a crazy thread
that I read a while back, <a class="reference external" href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/006812.html">Listening to habeneros</a>,
and of a sure-fire cure for hiccups from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.owlsprings.com/">Diane Duane</a>.</p>
<p>Me, when I get hiccups,
I just take a very deep breath and hold it for as long as I can.
If it doesn't work the first time, it does on the second attempt.</p>
<p>Cure #1, letting a large spoonful of sugar dissolve in the mouth,
is the only cure that's ever worked for Emma.</p>
<p>Here's Diane Duane on <a class="reference external" href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/006812.html#95991">curing hiccups</a>:</p>

<p>As the Twelve Days of Christmas approach,
it's time once again to make fun of them.
Strictly speaking, we can't start until
December 25th, the first day of Christmas,
but the Xmas season starts earlier every year.</p>
<p>My favorite has long been Frank Kelly's <em>Christmas Countdown</em>,
which was a big hit in Ireland and Britain in the early 1980s.
It's couched as twelve in&shy;creas&shy;ing&shy;ly ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ed letters from
Gobnait O'Lughnasa to his friend Nuala. Here's Day Six:</p>
<blockquote>

your generosity but the six geese have not alone nearly murdered the

    <p>I'm in&shy;dif&shy;fer&shy;ent to most fantasy books, but I've been a fan of
George R.R. Martin's <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series,
since I read the first book,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553573403/georgvreill-20">A Game of Thrones</a>,
in 1997.
I read the second book
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553108034/georgvreill-20">A Clash of Kings</a>,
in 1999.
The third book
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055357342X/georgvreill-20">A Storm of Swords</a>
came out five years ago, and I've been awaiting
the fourth book,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553801503/georgvreill-20">A Feast for Crows</a>,
ever since.
After several post&shy;pone&shy;ments, it's finally out.</p>
<p>It's an epic tale of love, war, and intrigue.
Five Kings are fighting for control,
by sword, by guile, and sometimes by magic.
Strange creatures are rising in the frozen North, beyond the Wall.
Dragons are reap&shy;pear&shy;ing in the South.

    <p>I finally updated my blog to run on dasBlog 1.8.
Not too painful.
I unzipped the binary dis&shy;tri&shy;b&shy;u&shy;tion,
downloaded the content folder from my server to my local drive,
ran the provided upgrade utility,
and used WinMerge to update the con&shy;fig&shy;u&shy;ra&shy;tion files.</p>
<p>The most obvious change is that I'm using a new theme (skin),
which gives the site a very different look.
The previous default theme had problems if your browser window was too narrow,
due to some hardcoded table sizes (I think).</p>
<p>I also figured out how to post to dasBlog via w.bloggar.
I looked for info on con&shy;fig&shy;ur&shy;ing w.bloggar a few weeks ago, and couldn't find it then.</p>

    <p>Last weekend, we made good progress on the basement.
On Saturday, Dale and Ernest helped us out, doing some demolition
in the basement, and bringing loads to Goodwill and to the dump
in their truck.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Jill and Delf helped us clean the remaining stuff
out of the basement. Louise excavated a hole outside the window
that we're going to enlarge. Deb, currently <em>hors de combat</em>
with a pinched nerve, dropped by to provide moral support,
as did Frank and Lyndol. Delf spent nearly twelve hours with us that day,
and thanks to his experience in con&shy;struc&shy;tion, he and I built
framing around the furnace.</p>
