    <p>I learned a really clever trick at our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2005/09/14/KatrinaEvacueesWorkPartiesAndScalingBack.aspx">workparty</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p>We were using a dolly that we had borrowed from our neighbor Mary
to haul a heavy credenza up from the basement.
One of the tires was flat, which made the exercise even more difficult.</p>
<p>I got out my bicycle floor pump and started pumping,
but it was a waste of time.
The tire was tubeless and without any air,
so it just slipped loosely around the rim.
After a few minutes of futility,
Dale remembered something he had seen years before at a gas station.</p>
<p>He got a bowl of soapy water and a sponge,
and coated the metal <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/14/SoapingUpAFlatTire.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>My good friend Frank Maloney turned 60 the other day.
A few months ago, he invited Emma and me to join him
and his partner, Lyndol,
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theherbfarm.com">The Herbfarm</a>.
The Herbfarm is one of the very best restau&shy;rants in the Seattle area.
Certainly one of the most expensive.</p>

<p>Frank brought us to The Herbfarm, but not at his own expense.
One of Frank's college roommates was Ron Zimmerman,
the owner of The Herbfarm,
and Ron had invited Frank to bring Lyndol and two guests
over for his 60th birthday.
Ron semi-seriously credits Frank with in&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;ing him to good wine,
when Frank was a sommelier in the Seventies.</p>

<p>We had a marvelous time.

    <p>In August 2001, George W. Bush ignored a warning that Osama Bin Laden

<p>In March 2003, Bush started an un&shy;nec&shy;es&shy;sary war against Iraq.
Tens of thousands died.</p>
<p>In August 2005, Bush ignored warnings that a major hurricane
would strike New Orleans, and stayed on vacation.
He played guitar in Arizona while New Orleans drowned.
Uncounted thousands died.</p>
<p>Not until Wednesday did he return to Washington.
Even now, he has yet to show leadership.
Photo ops are not leadership. Platitudes are not leadership.</p>
<p>For four years, the Bush ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion has played the terror card,

College. Today, we started on per&shy;spec&shy;tive. We began by watching a
45-minute <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cloudband.com/frames.mhtml/magazine/articles/rev_dinwiddie_surface_0699.html">video by David Hockney</a>, where he contrasts three paintings:
a Canaletto painting of Venice, and two Chinese scrolls painted
70 years apart.</p>
<p>The Canaletto is a classic <a class="reference external" href="http://drawsketch.about.com/library/weekly/aa021603c.htm">two-point linear per&shy;spec&shy;tive</a> painting.
Both of the Chinese scrolls show trips by the emperor along the
Grand Canal. The first one, by Wang Hui, is 27 inches high and 72 feet wide!
It uses multiple per&shy;spec&shy;tive to show scenes, in a manner
that is strange to my Western eyes. Hockney demon&shy;strates how
effective it is. For example, he shows a corner <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/07/20/SurfaceIsIllusionButSoIsDepth.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>I've been a fan of both Bernard Cornwell and Patrick O'Brian
for a number of years.
Both are known for their historic fiction set in the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
<p>Cornwell has written 20 <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bernardcornwell.net/index2.cfm?page=1&amp;SeriesId=1">books about Richard Sharpe</a>,
a rough and ready British Army officer, up from the ranks.
Cornwell excels at writing battle scenes, capturing the
smells and sounds, the noise and confusion, the blood and the gore.
Some of them were turned into a TV miniseries in the mid-1990s,
with Sean Bean as Sharpe.</p>
<p>O'Brian wrote 20 novels about Captain Jack Aubrey and
Dr. Stephen Maturin of the Royal Navy.
The Russell Crowe movie

    <p>For the last three years, I've been involved with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/">The Wild Geese Players of Seattle</a>,
an amateur group that does readings of Irish literature,
par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly the works of James Joyce and W.B.&nbsp;Yeats.
Our big event every year is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday">Bloomsday</a>,
June 16th, com&shy;mem&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ing Joyce's Ulysses,
which takes place on June 16th, 1904.
It's a tale of a Jewish everyman, Leopold Bloom,
wandering through Dublin one day,
and of the young writer (and Joyce's alter ego), Stephen Dedalus.
We're working our way through the book,
reading a chapter or two each year.
In this, our eighth year, we'll be reading Chapter&nbsp;11, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2005.html">Sirens</a>,

<p>After several months of not blogging, I've decided to resume. EraBlog was
nice while it lasted, but Mike Amundsen hasn't been paying attention to it
for a while. I was always frustrated at the lack of con&shy;fig&shy;ura&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty, and I
hated the hard-coded limit of three posts showing up on the front page.</p>
<p>I've moved to <a class="reference external" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/george_v_reilly/">http://weblogs.asp.net/george_v_reil&shy;ly/</a>.</p>
