<p>Today, I did something that I've never done before.
I visited my US Senators' offices, with a handful of others,
to help stiffen their spines on healthcare reform.</p>
<p>It started by accident last night when Mira mentioned on Facebook
that she was going to visit Rep. Jim McDermott, Sen. Maria Cantwell,
and Sen. Patty Murray's Seattle offices today
to talk to them about the “public option”.</p>
<p>McDermott and Murray were already supporters of the public health insurance option.
Cantwell's position was murkier and she came out in favor of
some kind of lame “co-op” compromise earlier this week.
Mira and her friends had no difficulty in setting up meetings with <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/06/27/TalkingToSenatorsAboutHealthcareReform.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>It seems no-one thought to set up a map of the events and restau&shy;rants,

Google Maps crashed Safari&nbsp;4 while trying to print the map.</p>

<p>Andy Boychuk has just become the leader of the opposition party in Saskatchewan
when he is murdered.
His advisor, Joanne Kilbourn, sees him drink the poison.
Her own husband was sense&shy;less&shy;ly murdered a few years earlier,
and Andy was not only her boss but an old friend, so it's difficult for her.
When she decides to write a biography of Andy
and learns unexpected things about him,
her health mys&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;ous&shy;ly begins to fail.</p>
<p>Joanne is a middle-aged widow with children,
who has spent her life working behind the scenes in Saskatchewan politics.

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)">Up</a> is another gem from Pixar.
A shy little boy Carl Fredrick&shy;sen meets the exuberant Ellie,
who also hero worships Charles Muntz, noted explorer of Paradise Falls.
They grow old together and Ellie dies
before they can achieve their lifelong dream of an adventure.
With nothing left to lose, Carl attaches 10,000 helium balloons to his house
and floats off to South America in search of Paradise Falls,
in&shy;ad&shy;ver&shy;tent&shy;ly taking Russell, a Wilderness Explorer, with him.</p>
<p>The movie appealed just as much to the kids at our showing as the adults.
The sto&shy;ry&shy;telling is first rate, combining humor, adventure, love, and pathos.

I blamed Windows Update, since it happened within hours of a pile of updates being installed.
I upgraded to the latest beta NVidia drivers on Monday
and it helped for a while, but by Wednesday,
it was almost as bad again as it had been last Friday.
It was in&shy;fu&shy;ri&shy;at&shy;ing and I was both en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing and alarming my neighbors
with my cursing.</p>

As yet, the menu is limited.
The Maximus is a pulled pork sandwich with a hot sauce,

They have a vegetarian sandwich, chips made from potatoes and vegetables,
and hibiscus and ginger lemonades.</p>
