<p><em>Farthing</em> is set in a world where the British agreed to a peace with Hitler in 1941,
eight years ago.
This book starts out like a classic British murder mystery:
a prominent right-wing politician is murdered at the Farthing country estate
and Scotland Yard are called in.
The story is told from two viewpoints,
that of the secretly homosexual Inspector Carmichael
and that of the daughter of the house, Lucy Kahn, who married a Jew.
The dead man has a yellow star pinned to his chest,
making David Kahn a likely suspect.</p>
<p>The murder pre&shy;cip&shy;i&shy;tates Britain's <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/11/12/ReviewFarthing.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Kylar Stern ap&shy;pren&shy;tices himself to Durzo Blint,
the city of Cenaria's most ac&shy;com&shy;plished assassin.
A truly successful assassin can have no friends or emotional at&shy;tach&shy;ments,
something that Kylar struggles with.</p>
<p>This coming-of-age story set against a backdrop of intrigue and sorcery
is en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing but somewhat clumsy.</p>

<p>It's shocking how few times I've crossed the Cascades into Eastern Washington
in the seventeen years that I've lived in Seattle.
We go up or down the I-5 corridor, usually heading for Portland or Vancouver,
or we cross Puget Sound to the Olympic Peninsula.
But we never go more than about 30 miles inland.</p>
<p>We needed a break and we wanted to celebrate our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/11/07/12thAnniversary.aspx">12th an&shy;niver&shy;sary</a>.

The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tricitieswinefestival.com/">Tri-Cities Wine Festival</a> was being held in Kennewick today,
so that was our des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion.</p>

<p>Twelve years ago today, Emma and I met face-to-face for the first time.
We had been talking on the phone for about three weeks
after I had answered her personals ad in <em>The Stranger</em>.
We might have met a little sooner,
but she was busy meeting the other guys who had responded,
and I was undergoing the IIS&nbsp;4 deathmarch at Microsoft.</p>
<p>We were both nervous and we each responded char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;ti&shy;cal&shy;ly.
Emma babbled; I said very little.
She told me later that she thought that she had scared me off.
She hadn't, though.
We had already talked several times on the phone and she had been less nervous.
I liked her and <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/11/07/12thAnniversary.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I'm fairly confident that Referendum&nbsp;71 will be approved.
It was leading by 51% this morning and by 51.8% this evening,
and leading 2:1 in King County, the most populous, most liberal county in Washington state.</p>
<p>Ballots merely have to be postmarked by Election Day to be valid,

<p>Sonchai Jit&shy;pleecheep is a devout Buddhist, half Thai and half American,
and one of the few Bangkok cops who is not on the take.
An American marine is murdered grotesque&shy;ly
in a manner that ac&shy;ci&shy;den&shy;tal&shy;ly kills Sonchai's partner and soul brother.
Sonchai must help the FBI in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gate and seek his own revenge.
The trail takes them through the foulest gutters and the palaces of the wealthy.
We encounter pros&shy;ti&shy;tutes, monks, shemales, jade collectors, and gangsters
in a tour of the Thailand that most Westerners barely glimpse.</p>

<p>When we moved to Beacon Hill in 2000,
we were totally dumb&shy;found&shy;ed by the number of kids
who came trick-or-treating to our door.
In the prior two years, we had been renting a house in Walling&shy;ford,
and we had only had one set of kids each year.</p>
<p>We had about 100 kids that first year.
We were not expecting the onslaught and ran out of candy,
which led to Emma being berated by some pre&shy;sump&shy;tu&shy;ous mother.
We live in a relatively affluent block
and kids are brought quite a distance to partake of the goodies.
One small boy peered up at Emma once and asked her, “Are you rich?”</p>

<p>I saw Green&shy;stage's production of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.greenstage.org/2009/titus">Titus Andronicus</a> on Sunday night.
Normally, this is Shake&shy;speare's bloodiest tragedy,
but Greenstage chose to play it as a dark comedy.
It's still bloody, extremely bloody, blood everywhere,
spurting from severed wrists,
spraying from cut throats,
shooting over the stage
(and some of the audience).</p>
<p>The first twenty minutes were very confusing.
The actors spoke their lines very quickly and I had a hard time
tuning in to what they were saying and what was happening.
Then either they slowed down or I tuned in,
but it started making sense,
inasmuch as Titus Andronicus can ever make sense.</p>
<p>I've seen Greenstage do comedies and straight tragedies.
Here they hammed it <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/10/28/TitusAndronicus.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I spent last Wednesday at Benaroya Hall,
attending the Seattle edition of Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow's traveling <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-developer-days-conference/">DevDays conference</a>.
It was well worth $99.</p>
<p>Joel Spolsky, owner of FogCreek Software and co-founder of Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow,
opened the conference with a keynote about the
dichotomy of power and simplicity.
People are happier when not over&shy;whelmed with choices.
Many of the choices that software forces users to make
are es&shy;sen&shy;tial&shy;ly mean&shy;ing&shy;less to the users.
However, even though people want simplicity, they also want features
and different people use different features.
Powerful software sells more copies.</p>
<p>He argues that developers and designers should put in the extra work to make good choices
on behalf of the users: don't make users <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/10/26/StackOverflowDevDaysSeattle2009.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>As part of my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/10/15/GittingAlong.aspx">personal conversion to Git</a>, I read Swice&shy;good's Git book.
It's a decent in&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;tion to Git and you learn how to
do all the basic tasks as well as some more advanced topics.
The examples are clear and well-paced.</p>
<p>I would have liked to see more about col&shy;lab&shy;o&shy;ra&shy;tion and workflow in a DVCS world,
perhaps a few case studies:
how is Git used in the Linux kernel de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment process;
how a small, dis&shy;trib&shy;uted team uses Git and GitHub;
how a collocated team migrates from more tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al tools.</p>
