&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of March, I read an article in the &lt;em&gt;Irish Independent&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/the-girl-who-stole-my-book-how-eilis-ohanlon-found-out-her-crime-novels-were-swiped-by-a-stranger-34561638.html&#34;&gt;The girl who stole my book&lt;/a&gt;,
about a blatant case of plagiarism.
A Kindle All Star author by the name of Joanne Clancy
had taken two books written by Ingrid Black a decade earlier,
and rewritten them in her own words,
changing the names and adjectives
but preserving the plot.
Eilis O&#39;Hanlon, one half of the pseudonymous duo behind Ingrid Black,
only found out about the plagiarism by accident,
thanks to a tweet from a sharp-eyed reader.
O&#39;Hanlon wrote about the experience at more length in &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E7M5NMQ/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;The Real Book Thief&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saxon is a former FBI agent,
now living in Dublin and sleeping with Detective Chief Superintendent Grace Fitzgerald.
Ed Fagan, a serial killer last heard of five years ago, is back,
sending letters to the newspaper and claiming fresh victims.
But Saxon knows that Fagan is dead—because she killed him and buried him—so who&#39;s passing himself off as Fagan?
She just barely manages to be invited in as a consultant on the case.
The killer is clever and elusive and leaves a bloody trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from her lover, Saxon has few friends, and is not liked by the Gardaí.
She keeps everyone at bay with her biting wit and hardboiled attitude.
Still, she&#39;s an interesting character and the plot was good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Panel on Marriage Equality</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/04/PanelOnMarriageEquality.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/1806979636191540/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Panelists and Irish Network members&#34; src=&#34;https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/13391474_1633546976970055_6097193358846557945_o.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 800px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was supposed to be a second showing of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/02/ReviewTheQueenOfIreland.html&#34;&gt;The Queen of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; documentary
this morning at the SIFF Uptown,
preceded by a panel discussion on Marriage Equality.
We attended the discussion,
which was moderated by Phil Grant, the Consul General of Ireland.
The three panelists were
Rory O&#39;Neill, aka Panti Bliss, out of drag,
the accidental activist who became the face of marriage equality in Ireland;
Mayor Ed Murray, an Irish-American and Washington state&#39;s best-known gay politician;
and Gary Gates, an LGBT demographer, married to an Irishman,
who advised the Irish campaigners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a strong interest in marriage equality,
going back more than 20 years—I was wearing a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://lgbtweekly.com/2015/04/29/special-commentary-the-hawaii-heroes/&#34;&gt;HERMP&lt;/a&gt; shirt that I bought in 1993 at Thursday&#39;s premiere.
I worked on the technical teams
for both the 2009 Approve Referendum 71 campaign,
which saved Washington state&#39;s domestic partnership bill,
and the 2012 Approve Referendum 74 campaign,
which saved Washington&#39;s equal marriage bill.
I hold treasured of winning those campaigns
and of watching from afar as Ireland said &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/05/23/ireland-yes-on-marriage-equality.html&#34;&gt;Yes to Marriage Equality&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On principle, putting civil rights up to a popular vote
didn&#39;t sit well with the panel, or with me.
Different circumstances forced such votes
both in Ireland and in Washington in 2009 and 2012.
In the Irish case,
the language of the Irish Constitution had to be changed,
which required an amendment.
In Washington,
both referenda were ballot initiatives
designed to repeal legislation previously enacted by state lawmakers.
As Ed Murray reminded us,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-fourth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland&#34;&gt;Ireland&#39;s referendum&lt;/a&gt; passed with overwhelming approval,
winning in all but one constituency,
whereas &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Referendum_74&#34;&gt;Referendum 74&lt;/a&gt; barely passed in Washington,
where the more liberal cities around Puget Sound
outvoted conservatives in the rest of the state.
He also reminded us that Marriage Equality had the support of all major Irish political parties,
whereas there&#39;s a major partisan divide in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed said that he personally knew Republican politicians who supported equality,
but who couldn&#39;t be seen to do so by their voters.
Gary said that part of his work had been to assemble economic arguments,
which in some cases gave the necessary cover to such politicians to do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rory mentioned that he had assumed that after the Irish referendum,
that life would go on much as before save that same-sex couples could get married.
In fact, he found that gay couples had become much more willing to hold hands in public
and that this continued a year after the referendum.
In the Irish case,
the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/chrissy-curtin/pantigate-an-illustrated-timeline-dafef882b0be&#34;&gt;Pantigate&lt;/a&gt; scandal in early 2014
had occasioned a major national conversation
around homophobia and censorship.
This had benefited the 2015 equality campaign,
as most people now realized that they knew
LGBT people in their family or their neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also mentioned that he reminds Irish gays that it&#39;s not so good elsewhere.
Panti had appeared in Sarajevo a month ago
and the theater there had to arrange extra security,
as that part of the world remains virulently homophobic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of transphobic bathroom bills came up.
It&#39;s the opinion of both Ed Murray and Joe McDermott
that &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2016/04/28/24021548/washington-wont-discriminate-packs-the-pews-to-fight-anti-trans-ballot-initiative-1515&#34;&gt;Initiative 1515&lt;/a&gt; will get enough signatures to be on the ballot in November.
This would amend Washington&#39;s 2006 anti-discrimination law.
I asked later who was leading the fight against I-1515:
answer, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.washingtonwontdiscriminate.org/&#34;&gt;Washington Won&#39;t Discriminate&lt;/a&gt;.
I also asked about the state of marriage equality in Northern Ireland.
Rory said that the DUP are misusing &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/18/northern-ireland-gay-community-democratic-unionst-party-marriage-equality-tactical-voting&#34;&gt;petitions of concern&lt;/a&gt; to veto progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway through the panel discussion,
the power abruptly went out in the cinema.
It turned out that power would be out for several hours—despite City Light getting a prompt call from the mayor who was sitting right there—and the second showing of &lt;em&gt;The Queen of Ireland&lt;/em&gt; is postponed until 10am Sunday.
We continued the discussion in the near dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a photo session outside afterwards, as you can see above.
I talked to Rory briefly and discovered that he&#39;s known my cousin Tom for many years.
Tom is gay and used to do drag, so this wasn&#39;t a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am heartened by the progress we&#39;ve made in the US and Ireland
in the last 20 years.
But the struggle is not over yet.
A transphobic backlash is underway around the US,
and LGBT rights are still weak in much of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collection of short stories and essays from Kate Elliott,
some of which are drawn from her various story universes.
In the foreword and the essays,
she discusses the cultural biases that
lead to the “male gaze” and male characters
being the unconsidered defaults for many readers and writers.
These stories amply demonstrate that good, interesting fantasy and SF stories
can be written with strong female characters and subtle plots.
(I already knew this; some in SF fandom still don&#39;t.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years in Seattle, I&#39;ve met
the Prime Minister (Taoiseach) of Ireland,
the President of Ireland,
and now the Queen of Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen_of_Ireland&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The Queen of Ireland&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/PantiBliss.jpg/440px-PantiBliss.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Rating: ★ ★ ★ ★ ½&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Released: 2015&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Keywords: documentary, ireland, lgbt&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Watched: 2 June, 2016&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen_of_Ireland&#34;&gt;The Queen of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; is a documentary about Ireland&#39;s best-known drag queen,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panti&#34;&gt;Panti Bliss&lt;/a&gt; (Rory O&#39;Neill), who became an accidental activist
and the face of marriage equality in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filming started in 2010.
In early 2014, O&#39;Neill appeared on an RTÉ chat show
and alleged that some individuals in Irish journalism are homophobic.
They threatened to sue and RTÉ backed down, apologizing and paying them €85,000.
This became known as &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/chrissy-curtin/pantigate-an-illustrated-timeline-dafef882b0be&#34;&gt;Pantigate&lt;/a&gt;.
Panti gave a “&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXayhUzWnl0&#34;&gt;Noble Call&lt;/a&gt;” speech about homophobia at the Abbey Theatre,
which went viral on Youtube,
becoming internationally known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following year,
Ireland held a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/05/23/ireland-yes-on-marriage-equality.html&#34;&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; on Marriage Equality
and became the first country to grant full rights to LGBT citizens by popular vote.
Panti was one of the most high-profile campaigners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary covers Panti&#39;s life,
from a childhood in Ballinrobe, Co. Mayo;
the blatant homophobia of Ireland during Rory&#39;s youth in the seventies and eighties;
to becoming a fledgling drag queen in Tokyo in the late eighties and early nineties;
to moving back to Ireland and becoming a fixture in Dublin&#39;s gay scene,
shepherding the Alternative Miss Ireland contest for many years;
to Pantigate, the Noble Call speech, and the Marriage campaign;
to finally a homecoming at a sold-out show in Ballinrobe.
It presents Panti, who describes herself as a “giant cartoon woman”,
as a larger-than-life figure,
and interviews her thoughtful alter ego, Rory,
who says that being Panti has made him a better person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an LGBT expatriate who grew up in Ireland at the same time as Rory,
I found it especially personal and moving,
but I think &lt;em&gt;The Queen of Ireland&lt;/em&gt; is of much wider interest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HouseCanary PyCon2016 Progamming Challenge</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/01/HouseCanaryPyCon2016ProgammingChallenge.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, while at PyCon,
I whipped up a quick, brute-force answer
to the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/housecanary/PyCon2016&#34;&gt;HouseCanary PyCon2016 Progamming Challenge&lt;/a&gt;
in a few minutes.
That was sufficient to pass the first two test cases
and win me a very pretty HouseCanary t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer ran in &lt;em&gt;O(n⁴)&lt;/em&gt; time, so it failed miserably on the larger problem sets
in the third and fourth cases.
I mulled it over and came up with an &lt;em&gt;O(n²)&lt;/em&gt; solution that runs in reasonable time
on the larger problem sets.
On the second test case, &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;input1.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, runtime drops from 5.2s to 0.2s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I submitted my new answer.
I&#39;ll learn on Monday if I won the speed challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Keywords: crime, humor&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Listening period: 27–31 May, 2016&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely listen to &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/15/Audiobooks.aspx&#34;&gt;audiobooks&lt;/a&gt;, except on long driving trips.
We listened to another &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/20/ReviewTheHotRock.html&#34;&gt;Dortmunder&lt;/a&gt; book on our drive
down to and back from Portland for PyCon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dortmunder&#39;s jinxed associate Andy Kelp spends a few days in jail
and reads a book called &lt;em&gt;Child Heist&lt;/em&gt; by Richard Stark,
which Kelp believes to be the blueprint for a perfect crime.
Dortmunder, always wary of Kelp&#39;s schemes,
doesn&#39;t appreciate having a plan brought to him,
since he&#39;s always been the planner of the crew.
Some of the crew aren&#39;t eager to kidnap a child either,
but eventually they all come around.
Unfortunately for them, the kid is much smarter than they are,
so the perfect crime fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the joke is that Westlake wrote a series of novels
about the ruthless career criminal &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_(character)&#34;&gt;Parker&lt;/a&gt; under the pseudonym Richard Stark.
&lt;em&gt;Child Heist&lt;/em&gt; is not a real Parker novel, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audiobook is very amusing with a fine performance from the narrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot was loosely inspired by the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://thewestlakereview.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/review-jimmy-the-kid/&#34;&gt;real-life kidnapping of a Peugeot heir&lt;/a&gt;.
Apparently there&#39;s a lousy &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/28/AdaptingBooksForFilmAndTV.html&#34;&gt;movie adaptation&lt;/a&gt; with Gary Coleman made in 1982,

&lt;p&gt;Joanna Kilbourn&#39;s husband, Ian, was senselessly murdered
along the Trans-Canada Highway six years ago.
Now the killer has been murdered in prison.
And his vile girlfriend, who was acquitted of Ian&#39;s murder, is making threats.
Then she&#39;s found dead, strangled by Joanna&#39;s scarf, and Joanna is the prime suspect.
Joanna, who is a quietly competent mother, professor, and political commentator,
starts digging and she finds things that alarm her about Ian&#39;s past,
things that she had missed in her fog of grief after his murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fine blend of domesticity, political infighting, and detection.
Joanna is a keen observer of both her family and her political colleagues,
but she too is surprised at how this story plays out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drove down to Portland, Oregon yesterday for &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://us.pycon.org/2016/&#34;&gt;PyCon&lt;/a&gt;.
No trip to Portland would be complete without a trip to &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.powells.com/&#34;&gt;Powell&#39;s bookstore&lt;/a&gt;.
I don&#39;t have much time this trip, but we did manage to spend an hour there last night,
before they closed at 11pm.
There&#39;s nothing like it in Seattle.
I like Elliott Bay Bookstore but it&#39;s a pale shadow of Powell&#39;s.
A long time ago, someone described Powell&#39;s to me as “the best bookstore in Seattle”—meaning that Seattleites who want to visit a world-class bookstore
have to visit Portland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got out lightly.
I spent only $85.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five astronauts are stranded on Mars.
Their only hope is to find the vehicle of an earlier crew who died—but that ship is at the north pole and they&#39;re south of the equator.
And so they trek north across Mars.
They know that the other ship can&#39;t hold them all,
and some of them start dying along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landis is a NASA scientist who writes “&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_science_fiction&#34;&gt;hard science fiction&lt;/a&gt;”;
i.e., SF that&#39;s solidly based in science,
some of which is known for plodding writing and dull characters.
Landis&#39;s characters have some depth but they&#39;re not that interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shrinking PDF File Size</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/05/26/ShrinkingPDFFileSize.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our poster designer sent me a PDF of this year&#39;s &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2016.html&#34;&gt;Bloomsday poster&lt;/a&gt;.
I thought the file was too large at 7.2MB and I wanted to reduce the file size
without significant loss of image quality.
I was unable to achieve this in Preview or Acrobat Reader,
but Ghostscript did the trick,
thanks to an answer on &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://askubuntu.com/a/256449/956&#34;&gt;AskUbuntu&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Seattle Power Outage</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/05/25/SeattlePowerOutage.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://komonews.com/news/local/downtown-seattle-hit-by-major-power-outage&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The City of #Seattle has lost power... And I&#39;m stuck on the 11th floor.&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e35/13249716_1560636147564215_1107763522_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTI1ODE0OTg5MTQ0NDM4ODgxMg%3D%3D.2&#34; style=&#34;width: 200px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://komonews.com/news/local/downtown-seattle-hit-by-major-power-outage&#34;&gt;power suddenly went out&lt;/a&gt; at work today about 11:30am.
There was a technician who was running wires,
standing on a ladder next to us,
who disclaimed all responsibility.
Since the wires were Ethernet cables, we believed him.
It quickly became apparent that it was not just our office or even our building,
but many blocks of downtown Seattle that had lost power.
One person was trapped in the elevator in our old Pioneer Square building.
Within half an hour, everyone had left the office.
Although most of us have laptops,
no electricity meant no Internet.
I drifted up to Capitol Hill and spent the afternoon
working with two colleagues in a coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power came back after an hour.
Meanwhile, it had become very apparent how fragile our infrastructure is,
as tens of thousands of people lost power in downtown Seattle.
Everything ground to a halt, including traffic,
as the stop lights stopped working.
Lots of people had to walk down many flights of stairs in tall buildings.
Although it was lunchtime,
restaurants and coffee shops were unable to serve customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a mess.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deploying a Docker Container on AWS</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/05/24/DeployingADockerContainerOnAWS.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2015/11/11/running-docker-aws-ground-up/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Docker + AWS&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://www.ybrikman.com/assets/img/blog/aws-docker/docker-on-aws.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a couple of frustrating hours this evening
trying to figure out an easy way to deploy a Docker container on AWS.
I tried out the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/&#34;&gt;EC2 Container Service&lt;/a&gt; and got lost
in a sea of Clusters, Tasks, and Services.
I couldn&#39;t connect to the EC2 instance where my container supposedly lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/&#34;&gt;Elastic Beanstalk&lt;/a&gt; and gave up in exasperation.
When you create a new Docker environment,
there&#39;s no way to pull an existing image from an external repo
that I could see.
We have some tools for deploying a Docker image to Elastic Beanstalk,
but they were so cryptic that I didn&#39;t want to pursue that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I went old school.
I created a new EC2 instance,
SSHed in,
installed Docker,
logged into the Docker repository,
pulled the image,
and started the container.
Admittedly, redeployment will be a pain
and I don&#39;t get autoscaling or other AWS goodness,
but I got the container working in 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Toastmasters&#39; Evaluations</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/05/23/ToastmastersEvaluations.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/toastmasters-evaluations-shelley-horwitz&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Why Evaluate?&#34; src=&#34;https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAXNAAAAJGViZWI5MWYxLTBhMjMtNDJhMS1iN2RjLTcxN2Q1MzQ2YzFkNA.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toastmasters teaches three skillsets.
By far the best known is public speaking,
but evaluation and leadership are also valuable.
Learning to evaluate a speech teaches you to listen carefully
and to give useful feedback.
The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/speech-evaluation-3-modified-sandwich-technique/&#34;&gt;Toastmasters&#39; Sandwich&lt;/a&gt; is the best-known approach:
point out several things the speaker did well,
suggest some areas of improvement,
and conclude with more praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evaluator benefits too from the evaluation,
as they hone their listening and critical skills
and as they learn to give helpful feedback.
The audience also benefits,
as they hear both the speech
and a measured response to the speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of Toastmasters,
feedback is often negative and critical (&amp;quot;Here&#39;s how you&#39;re fucking up&amp;quot;),
which leads to demotivation (&amp;quot;I&#39;m just a fuckup!&amp;quot;).
For beginning speakers,
who are often horribly afraid of speaking in public,
receiving some positive reinforcement
helps them realize that they already have some skills,
while specific suggestions can help them improve rapidly.
More advanced speakers who already know their own strengths and weaknesses
often prefer the evaluator to skip a few minutes of praise
and instead provide several very specific suggestions.
The audience may benefit, however, from hearing the praise,
when the evaluator points out things the speaker did particularly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few clubs also provide a few minutes of open evaluation
where members of the audience speak up and augment the original evaluation.
Freely Speaking Toastmasters does this
and I always find the broader set of perspectives valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Sandman earned a Victoria Cross in the Falklands
and spent a year relearning how to walk.
Now all he wants to do is to restore &lt;em&gt;Sycorax&lt;/em&gt;, his beloved old boat.
But to afford that, he has to work for TV star Tony Bannister.
Bannister wants to win the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.routehalifaxsaintpierre.com/new_site/contentframes/the_race.htm&#34;&gt;St Pierre–Halifax race&lt;/a&gt; with Sandman&#39;s help
and he wants to make a documentary about Sandman,
neither of which Sandman wants.
Bannister&#39;s wife died sailing the previous year
and her wealthy father holds Bannister responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s late 1990 and Saddam Hussein has just invaded Kuwait.
Paul Shanahan is an exiled Irish-American yacht delivery skipper.
He used to be a gunrunner for the IRA,
but rumors that he was a CIA agent have kept them at arms&#39; length.
Now the IRA have engaged him to sail $5,000,000 in Libyan-supplied gold coins
across the Atlantic to buy 53 Stinger missiles.
It stinks but he can&#39;t say no.
And maybe he is the CIA agent that he&#39;s rumored to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornwell is best known as a writer of historical action novels,
but he also wrote a handful of contemporary sailing thrillers
25–30 years ago.
This one holds up well.
Shanahan is a scoundrel alright,
and he&#39;s made some bad choices over the years that haunt him.
He&#39;ll make more before the novel is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Title: Avengers: Age of Ultron&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Writer–Director: Joss Whedon&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Rating: ★ ★ ★ ½&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Released: 2015&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Keywords: Marvel, superhero&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Watched: 20 May, 2016&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:_Age_of_Ultron&#34;&gt;Avengers: Age of Ultron&lt;/a&gt;,
Tony Stark&#39;s hubris leads to the creation of a lethal robot with daddy issues.
Ultron, who is supposed to be the ultimate planetary line of defense,
immediately goes rogue upon achieving sentience.
He vows to destroy humanity to save the planet,
and in particular to destroy his maker and the other Avengers.
His ally Wanda Maximoff (the Scarlet Witch) uses her powers
to sow dissension in their ranks, which nearly tears them apart.
They defeat Ultron only after enormous destruction of life and property,
with consequences that are later explored in &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/05/05/ReviewCaptainAmericaCivilWar.html&#34;&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large ensemble cast is a hindrance here,
as Whedon juggles multiple points of view and backstories,
trying to work in different aspects of Marvel lore,
which results in an overstuffed movie.
Ultron is a Frankenstein&#39;s Monster,
raging at his maker and the world,
determined to burn everything down.
It felt wrong that a newborn AI could instantly develop such a sarcastic, mocking tone—I suppose Ultron truly was Stark&#39;s offspring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Age of Affluence ended when the coastal cities drowned as the icecaps melted.
Many now eke out a living digging through the detritus of the past.
Nailer is a scrawny teenaged scavenger who finds a broken clipper ship after a storm.
There&#39;s only one survivor,
Nita, a swank girl who fled internecine feuding in her trading clan.
To protect her from his psychotic father and others who would sell her to her enemies,
they go on the run to Orleans,
with the aid of a “half-man”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacigalupi&#39;s drowned world seems all-too plausible.
In this dystopia, the lines between haves and have-nots are stark.
Nailer makes an appealing protagonist,
a boy with nothing who saves a girl who had everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Musgrave—Master of Defence and Master of Logic, friend to Will Shakespeare—is present at the very first performance of &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;
when the actor playing Mercutio is somehow fatally stabbed
with an envenomed rapier during an on-stage duel.
He uncovers perfidy and poisonings
which stretches back for years and
rises into the highest halls of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonkin has not only created a brilliant and dangerous protagonist,
he has meticulously recreated Elizabethan London,
a city that is a stew of ambition, peril, and intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Subtracting Compound Objects</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/05/17/SubtractingCompoundObjects.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Quick!
How many days between 2014-11-29 and 2016-05-17?
What&#39;s the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand on an analog clock
when the time reads 11:37?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard way to compute the difference between the two dates
is to start counting back months and days until you reach the earlier date,
or equivalently to count forward from the beginning.
(Don&#39;t forget that Feb 2016 has 29 days but Feb 2015 has 28.)
Similarly with the angle between the hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easier way is to compute the number of units between the first point
and some reference (or base) point,
to do the same for the second point,
and to subtract the two numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say the base date is 2000-01-01.
The first date, 2014-11-29 is 14 years since the base date,
and 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012 are leap years,
so 365*14 + 4 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 29 = 5,447 days.
The second date, 2016-05-17, is
365*16 + 4 + 31 + 29 + 31 + 30 + 17 = 5,982 days since 2000-01-01.
(Four not five leap years, since 2016 is incomplete and Feb 29 is counted.)
The difference is 535 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All modern date libraries have some notion of an epoch;
typically 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z is zero seconds.
Compute the number of seconds since the epoch for both dates, then subtract,
and divide the remainder by 24*60*60.
Note: this does not take daylight savings into account,
when certain days are 23 or 25 hours long.
However, a decent date library will handle all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this trick from Charles Bryant circa 1984 on Vax Pascal.
I don&#39;t believe there was a date library;
we just stored the year/month/day in a custom Pascal record.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Toastmasters Transitions</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/05/16/ToastmastersTransitions.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two transitions at Freely Speaking Toastmasters tonight:
Kim gave her last speech before moving to California
and Shasti gave her tenth speech,
which earned her her &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/toastmasters-speech-0-competent-communicator/&#34;&gt;Competent Communicator&lt;/a&gt; award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s always exciting to see people proceed through a series of speeches
and achieve milestones like the CC.
You see them get better with each speech.
The awkward fumbling hesitation of the early speeches
is supplanted by growing fluidity and confidence,
as the practice and the evaluations help them improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jet Butler lives on an isolated mesa in New Mexico.
One of her few friends is a suspect in a murder.
Cordelia Morgan, an outsider,
who turns out to be far more than she seems,
is also interested in the murder,
which seems to be somehow tied up in the sale of water rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This never quite gelled for me.
Despite the author&#39;s flair for description,
I found the plot confusing and I was not engaged with the two protagonists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conor Lalor&#39;s family life is falling apart.
His parents are breaking up and they&#39;re broke,
there not being much work in Dublin in 1985.
To economize, they take the 15-year-old out of his fee-paying Jesuit school
and send him to the Christian Brothers&#39; school in &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synge_Street_CBS&#34;&gt;Synge Street&lt;/a&gt;.
Conor wants to impress the beautiful girl who lives across the street
and he offers to put her in his music video.
Raphina accepts and then he has to pull together a band with his school mates,
which they call &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sing_Street&#34;&gt;Sing Street&lt;/a&gt;.
His older brother dissuades him from doing covers
and they start writing original (if very Eighties) music.
The band gets better and he draws closer to Raphina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sing Street&lt;/em&gt; brought back my own teens—my &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary%27s_College,_Dublin&#34;&gt;secondary school&lt;/a&gt; was half a mile south of Synge Street,
and I was a 20-year-old &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Dublin&#34;&gt;university&lt;/a&gt; student in Dublin in 1985.
However, I was never in a band:
neither I nor my friends were musical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a funny, tender movie,
with good music and strong performances from the mostly unknown cast,
as you might expect from the writer-director of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_(film)&#34;&gt;Once&lt;/a&gt;.
Aside from the fantastical ending,
I greatly enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_We_Do_in_the_Shadows&#34;&gt;What We Do In The Shadows&lt;/a&gt; is a mockumentary
about four vampires living in the suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand.
They are being filmed by a documentary crew in the months running up
to the Unholy Masquerade Ball,
the highlight of the social season
for the local vampires, witches, and zombies.
Not well adapted to modern life,
Viago, Vladislav, and Deacon are all hundreds of years old.
8,000-year-old Petyr turns a new vampire, Nick,
who brings his human friend, Stu, a computer programmer,
into their circle.
Stu—who the older vampires like better than Nick—brings them up to speed with the twenty-first century.
And then Stu runs into a pack of werewolves during a full moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What We Do In The Shadows&lt;/em&gt; is droll and charming,
expertly spoofing vampire clichés,
while maintaining the pseudo–&lt;em&gt;cinema verité&lt;/em&gt; traditions of mockumentaries
in following a group of earnest misfits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Title: Spy&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Director: Paul Feig&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Rating: ★ ★ ★ ★&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Released: 2015&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Keywords: action comedy&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Watched: 12 May, 2016&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy),
a self-effacing, overweight, desk-bound CIA mission controller,
spends her days in a verminous CIA basement
talking into the earpiece of her glamorous field agent counterpart.
When he&#39;s killed before her remote eyes and other field agents are compromised,
she goes into the field for the first time
and soon blossoms into a deadly agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never seen McCarthy in anything before and
I assumed that &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_(2015_film)&#34;&gt;Spy&lt;/a&gt; would be a dumb, gross-out comedy.
It was better than I feared
and genuinely funny at times.
McCarthy inhabits several personas,
ranging from the initial doormat of an analyst
through her cover as a guileless midwestern tourist
to her assumed cover as a hard-as-nails bodyguard,
and she is funny and occasionally touching.
Her performance is better than the script,
which, while amusing, is lazy and clichéd.&lt;/p&gt;
