&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Title: A Long Long Way&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Author: Sebastian Barry&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Rating: $stars(4.5)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Publisher: Penguin&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Copyright: 2005&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;ISBN: &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143035096/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;0143035096&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Pages: 304&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Keywords: fiction, historical, Ireland, First World War&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Reading period: 15–28 January, 2015&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willie Dunne is the innocent 18-year-old son of a senior Dublin policeman,
who promptly joins the Royal Dublin Fusiliers when the First World War breaks out,
along with thousands of other Irishmen.
Their early optimism that the war will be over by Christmas 1914 is soon crushed
as both sides get bogged down in the trench warfare of the Western Front.
Four long, brutal years of stalemate in the killing fields of Flanders follow,
and much of Willie&#39;s regiment die during those years.
We see the terror and the horror through Willie&#39;s eyes,
the waste of human life, the carnage, and the disillusionment of the Irish soldiers.
It&#39;s a harrowing book and also a beautiful elegy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The TerraServer</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/30/TerraServer.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://manx.classiccmp.org/collections/mds-199909/cd3/storage/smcppuga.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Unloading ESA 10000 Storage Subsystem Cabinet&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/content/binary/unloading_ESA10000_from_pallet.png&#34; style=&#34;width: 400px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a 2TB external hard disk today.
It&#39;s about the size of a deck of cards, but thinner,
and it cost me $95.
Disk Utility says it has 2,000,397,884,928 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, I got to see more than three terabytes of disks in one system.
At the time, a server with a 25GB disk was considered high capacity.
The 3TB system occupied considerably more volume than a pack of cards.
I don&#39;t know what it cost
but clearly it was tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, I was a developer on the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services&#34;&gt;IIS&lt;/a&gt; team at Microsoft.
I was the lead performance engineer for Microsoft&#39;s web server product.
The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraserver.com&#34;&gt;TerraServer&lt;/a&gt; was a project born in Microsoft Research
intended to demonstrate that SQL Server could scale up to terabyte-sized workloads.
It stored aerial, satellite, and topographic images of the Earth
in a SQL database available via the Internet,
and it was the world’s largest online atlas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They launched the TerraServer on the Internet.
And the Internet liked the TerraServer.
And the TerraServer fell over.
So I got called in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was June and I was wearing shorts and Birkenstock sandals with no socks.
The TerraServer was housed in one of Microsoft&#39;s data centers
and there was cold air blowing up through the floor,
and quite soon I was wishing that I had worn socks that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TerraServer was the biggest microcomputer-based system I had ever seen.
Quoting the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/68574/msr_tr_99_29_terraserver.pdf&#34;&gt;TerraServer Tech Report&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web site has eight Windows NT servers — 6 web servers and 2 database servers.
The USGS aerial imagery is maintained on a Compaq AlphaServer™ 8400
containing 8 440 Mhz Alpha processors and 10 GB of RAM.
The processor is attached to 7 StorageWorks™
Enterprise Storage Array 10000 (ESA-10000) cabinets.
The disk arrays are based on UltraSCSI technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each ESA-10000 contains 48 9 GB disk drives and
2 HSZ70 dual-redundant RAID-5 controllers.
4 sets of 11 disks each are configured into
a single RAID-5 stripe-set
and managed as a single logical disk by the HSZ70 controller.
2 drives per cabinet are available as hot spares.
Should a disk fail, the HSZ70 controllers automatically
swap a spare drive into a RAID set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows NT Server sees each large (85 GB each) disk
created by the RAID controllers of each of the seven disk cabinets.
It stripes these into 4 large (595 GB) volumes
which are then each formatted and managed
by the Windows NT file system (NTFS).
Each 595 GB volume contains about thirty 20GB files.
SQL Server stores its databases in these large files.
We chose this 20GB file size since it fits conveniently
on one DLT magnetic tape cartridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connected to the AlphaServer 8400 is a StorageTek 9710 automated tape robot.
The tape robot contains 10 Quantum DLT7000 tape drives.
Legato Networker backup software can backup
the entire 1.5 TB TerraServer SQL database to the StorageTek tape robot
in 7 hours and 15 minutes — or 17 GB/hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database back-end: 1 8-way 440Mhz Compaq AlphaServer 8400,
10GB ram, 3.2 TB raid5 324 9GB Ultra SCSI disks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, 7 &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://manx.classiccmp.org/collections/mds-199909/cd3/storage/smcppuga.pdf&#34;&gt;cabinets&lt;/a&gt; (pictured above)
measuring 2&#39; wide by 3&#39; deep and 5&#39; tall, housing 324 9GB disks.
And another cabinet for the servers.
And one for the tape robot.
The whole thing must have been about 20 feet wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison, the 15&amp;quot; mid-2012 MacBook Pro laptop that I&#39;m writing this on
has 16GB RAM, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 (4 hyperthreaded cores),
750GB internal disk (HDD), and the aforementioned 2TB external disk.
I&#39;ve been backing up to that external disk
and I&#39;ve been hitting 90MB/s transfer rates.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law&#34;&gt;Moore&#39;s Law&lt;/a&gt; marches on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I can&#39;t recall what I actually did to help them out,
but between me and other people,
they got it working satisfactorily within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Python Egg Cache</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/28/PythonEggCache.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every so often, one of our &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo&#34;&gt;Bamboo&lt;/a&gt; builds would break thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;literal-block&#34;&gt;
pkg_resources.ExtractionError: Can&#39;t extract file(s) to egg cache

The following error occurred while trying to extract file(s) to the Python egg
cache:

  [Errno 17] File exists: &#39;/home/bamboo/.python-eggs&#39;

The Python egg cache directory is currently set to:

  /home/bamboo/.python-eggs

Perhaps your account does not have write access to this directory?  You can
change the cache directory by setting the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment
variable to point to an accessible directory.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This occurred while trying to make use of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://pycrypto.org&#34;&gt;PyCrypto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a little &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2192323/what-is-the-python-egg-cache-python-egg-cache&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, I decided that instead of installing PyCrypto
as a zipped egg (as it does by default) into the build&#39;s virtual environment,
to instead force it to unzip itself: &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;easy_install &lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;--always-unzip&lt;/span&gt; pycrypto&lt;/tt&gt;.
This seems to have fixed the problem,
as &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/pkg_resources.html&#34;&gt;pkg_resources&lt;/a&gt; no longer needs to unpack anything.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://pillow.readthedocs.org/&#34;&gt;Pillow&lt;/a&gt; was also in the Egg Cache and probably needs similar treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Utili-Key 6-in-1 Multi-Tool</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/27/UtiliKey.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001EFSTI/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Utili-Key 6-in-1 Multi-Tool&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/content/binary/utili-key.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I posted a link to the new &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2015/01/leatherman-tread/&#34;&gt;Leatherman Tread Bracelet&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook
the other day, I mentioned that I had recently forfeited a little Swiss Army knife
that I&#39;d owned for 30 years at airport security.
The Tread is a bracelet where each link has one or more mini-tools.
The bracelet itself is about $150–$200, depending upon the exact tools.
With a watch, it&#39;s about $600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I can see the appeal, I have no intention of buying one.
Jan mentioned in the comments that he carries a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001EFSTI/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;Utili-Key 6-in-1 Multi-Tool&lt;/a&gt;
on his key ring, and he&#39;s never had any problems with it at TSA checkpoints.
Since it was only $6.21 at Amazon, I bought one.
And I spent $11.25 on the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AY2WLU/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;Micro-Max 19-in-1 Multi-Function Pocket Tool&lt;/a&gt;
while I was at it.
And I bought some books.
And an &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://aeropressmetalfilters.com/&#34;&gt;Aeropress Metal Filter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Utili-Key weighs only half an ounce and is just slightly longer than most keys.
It immediately found a place on my primary key ring,
along with the house keys,
the barcode key for the gym,
the barrel key for the laptop cable lock,
and the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.prontocycleshare.com/how-it-works&#34;&gt;Pronto Cycle Share&lt;/a&gt; key.
In my brief tests, the Utili-Key seems well made
and I think the tools will do in a pinch when better tools aren&#39;t handy.
I think that when using the bottle opener,
I&#39;ll have to take care not to cut myself on the little blade.
As Jan said, it&#39;ll work for the first bottle,
but it might not be a good idea for the fourth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micro-Max 19-in-1 is amusing, but I doubt I&#39;d carry it often,
since it&#39;s bulkier and heavier.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unseasonable January Weather</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/26/UnseasonableJanuaryWeather.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While the Northeast is being hammered with a major snowstorm,
we&#39;ve enjoyed some unseasonably warm weather in the Northwest.
Yesterday, it was 63°F (17°C) in Seattle—&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/seattle-sets-weather-record-boston-prepares-massiv/njw6m/&#34;&gt;a record high temperature&lt;/a&gt;.
The flowers are blooming. I smelled some glorious blossoms yesterday and today.
One friend dubbed it “sumter”.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Running PyCharm on Yosemite</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/25/PyCharmYosemite.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;PyCharm&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/content/binary/pycharm4-splash.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/17/YosemiteCleanInstall.aspx&#34;&gt;clean install of OS X 10.10&lt;/a&gt; on my home laptop a week ago.
I tried to launch &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/&#34;&gt;PyCharm&lt;/a&gt; 4.0.4 on it today.
It immediately failed. Every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I looked in the System Console, I saw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;literal-block&#34;&gt;
1/25/15 7:46:00.557 PM pycharm[1160]: No matching VM found.
1/25/15 7:46:00.711 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.jetbrains.pycharm.58252[1160]) Service exited with abnormal code: 1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JetBrains website wasn&#39;t very helpful when I looked there.
In time, I found a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26438628/crash-jetbrains-ide-with-yosemite-mac-osx-webstorm-intellij&#34;&gt;StackOverflow answer&lt;/a&gt; that put me on the right track
(and reminded me that I had previously solved this problem about a year ago, at work).
PyCharm and some of the other JetBrains IDEs require JDK 1.6,
as there are a number of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/entries/27854363-IDE-doesn-t-start-after-updating-to-Mac-OS-Yosemite-or-Mavericks&#34;&gt;problems with JDK 1.7 and 1.8&lt;/a&gt;.
After I downloaded and installed &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572&#34;&gt;Apple&#39;s Java 6&lt;/a&gt;, PyCharm ran without further problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, we all use the PyCharm IDE for Python development,
even those of us who are diehard Vim or Emacs users.
It does a great job of helping you write and debug Python projects.
The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim&#34;&gt;IdeaVim&lt;/a&gt; plugin does an acceptable job of emulating Vim keybindings.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Craft Distilleries</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/24/CraftDistilleries.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Washington state is well-known for coffee, wineries, and microbreweries.
Dozens of small-batch craft distilleries
have been started in Washington state since 2008
after a change in the law.
Most of them are quite good.
I drink Irish and Scotch whiskies,
but otherwise neither of us drink spirits often,
so we&#39;ve barely tried the local distilleries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drank a really nice gin from Sun Liquor at a New Year&#39;s Eve party,
and we&#39;ve been meaning to follow up.
This afternoon, we stopped at the Oola Distillery on Capitol Hill
and sampled all their wares.
We left with a half bottle of their
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://ooladistillery.com/home#products&#34;&gt;Rosemary Vodka&lt;/a&gt;.
Then we stopped in at Sun Liquor and came out with a bottle of the
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://sunliquor.com/hedgetrimmergin.php&#34;&gt;Hedge Trimmer Gin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the rate we consume spirits, those should last quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Removing DRM from Ebooks</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/23/RemovingDRMFromEbooks.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I buy a book, I want to be able to read it how and where I like,
not where the bookseller dictates.
With printed books, the very idea of the bookseller having any say is ridiculous.
The book is now my property, to read where and how I like,
to give away or to lend or even to sell.
I&#39;ve bought thousands of new books and thousands more secondhand books from bookstores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most electronic books are crippled with DRM.
DRM stands for &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management&#34;&gt;Digital Rights Management&lt;/a&gt;,
although &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.defectivebydesign.org/&#34;&gt;Defective By Design&lt;/a&gt; prefers to expand DRM
as &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management&#34;&gt;Digital Restrictions Management&lt;/a&gt;.
DRM is technology that controls digital content &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; it has been sold.
In particular, DRM&#39;d ebooks sold at Amazon are encrypted
and can only be read on Kindle devices and apps.
Similarly, DRM&#39;d ebooks from Barnes &amp;amp; Noble are restricted to Nook devices and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some publishers sell DRM-free ebooks at Amazon and B&amp;amp;N,
but they&#39;re in a small minority.
When I buy technical books, I try to buy directly from the publishers,
who will often bundle both the ebook and the pbook editions together
for a fraction of their separate costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having paid for an ebook, I want to read it on whatever computer or device is at hand,
regardless of where I bought it.
I can do that if I remove the DRM encryption.
Tools exist to help with that,
such as Apprentice Alf&#39;s &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/drm-removal-tools-for-ebooks/&#34;&gt;DRM Removal Tools for eBooks&lt;/a&gt;.
The plugin for &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://calibre-ebook.com/&#34;&gt;Calibre&lt;/a&gt; works very well.
I convert ebooks to unlocked EPUBs,
which I can then read on my eInk reader,

&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Keywords: mystery, holmes, audiobook&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Listening period: 11–21 January, 2015&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/15/Audiobooks.html&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, we&#39;ve been listening to some audiobooks.
We finished listening to &lt;em&gt;The Beekeeper&#39;s Apprentice&lt;/em&gt; last night.
I read the book many years ago and I&#39;ve read most of the subsequent books
in the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Russell_%28character%29&#34;&gt;Mary Russell&lt;/a&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen-year-old Mary Russell is walking on the Sussex Downs with her head in a book
one spring day in 1915, when she literally trips over Sherlock Holmes.
Although Holmes is almost four decades her senior,
the two brilliant, lonely people become friends
and Holmes tutors Russell in the art of detection.
Within a few years, his protégé becomes his partner.
In a later book, they marry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King offers a fresh take on Holmes, putting a more human face on him.
Russell and Holmes are both expertly drawn characters,
and King tells a good story.
At times, she revels in the minutiae of daily life,
while at other times, the plot gallops along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audiobook narrator, Jenny Sterlin, also does an excellent job,
finding the right tones for both Russell and Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/15/Audiobooks.html&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that a few months ago we had listened
to the audiobook of &lt;em&gt;The Hot Rock&lt;/em&gt;, the first of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dortmunder&#34;&gt;Dortmunder&lt;/a&gt; novels.
I just finished reading it as an ebook on my phone.
I enjoyed it a lot but I think I found it funnier when I heard it as an audiobook.
Partly, the first time around, I didn&#39;t know what was coming next;
partly, the narrator&#39;s skillful delivery gave me time to savor the humor.
I read so fast that I gallop past the punchlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dortmunder, newly released from prison, is engaged by an African diplomat
to steal a large emerald that&#39;s held sacred by the nation of Talabwo.
Dortmunder and his gang of misfit crooks steal the jewel,
but the guy with the jewel is caught.
They break him out of jail to get the jewel back, but he hid it in the police station.
They break into the police station and ... it&#39;s not there.
One heist after another, to get their hands on that jinxed jewel.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Seattle Goes to the Super Bowl Again</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/18/SeattleGoesToTheSuperBowlAgain.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I sat in a deserted coffee shop this afternoon with Emma,
as much of Seattle was watching the playoff game
of the Seattle Seahawks against the Green Bay Packers.
Idly curious, I checked the score early in the fourth quarter
and found that the Packers were leading 19–7.
I was quite surprised later to find that the Seahawks had won 28–22,
sending themselves to the Super Bowl in Arizona in two weeks&#39; time.
Apparently, it was a thrilling comeback late in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose that I&#39;m happy for my football-loving friends,
though I&#39;m inclined to “love the sinner but hate the sin”,
as I can&#39;t stand football.
I spent eleven years (ages 7–18) at a rugby-playing school in Dublin,
where I came away with an abiding dislike of that game and the jock culture.
American football, if anything, is worse:
a brutal, punishing sport with obnoxious fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re thinking of having a non-Super Bowl Super Bowl party—a football-free party held at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Clean Installing Yosemite</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/17/YosemiteCleanInstall.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Yosemite&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;OS X Yosemite&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/05/os_x_yosemite_roundup.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every few years, I find it necessary to wipe my computers
and do a clean install of the operating system.
As a developer and a power user, I install a lot of software.
The cumulative effect of installations and upgrades
is to leave a lot of cruft on the machines.
Entropy increases and the machines grow slower and perhaps less reliable.
So I like to wipe the hard disk, install a new operating system,
and reinstall only those apps that I know I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mid-2012 MacBook Pro came with OS X 10.7.
Shortly thereafer, 10.8 was released and I promptly upgraded; likewise with 10.9.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Yosemite&#34;&gt;Yosemite&lt;/a&gt; (10.10) was released in October 2014,
but I held off switching until now,
as I knew I wanted to do a clean install,
which meant setting aside a sizeable block of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I backed up everything during the week,
over and above my normal backups of external drives,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.crashplan.com&#34;&gt;CrashPlan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/&#34;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.
I made a list of all the apps that I care about and of various settings.
And I prepared a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.macworld.com/article/2367748/how-to-make-a-bootable-os-x-10-10-yosemite-install-drive.html&#34;&gt;bootable thumb drive&lt;/a&gt; with the OS X Yosemite Installer app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, I inserted the thumb drive into the USB slot.
I restarted the machine while holding down the Option key,
which brought me to a boot menu.
I used Disk Utility to erase the partition and then I installed Yosemite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I spent many hours installing apps I care about
and restoring data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been a fan of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://brew.sh/&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; package manager for several years.
It does a great job of installing and updating developer-related tools
for use at the command line.
Last year, I learned about a sister project, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://caskroom.io/&#34;&gt;Homebrew Cask&lt;/a&gt;,
which takes of installing graphical applications.
Instead of downloading DMGs, I used Cask to install a number of apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts&#34;&gt;Caskroom Fonts&lt;/a&gt; last night,
which took care of installing most of the fonts I care about.
One exception: I wanted to install Consolas and some of the other C* fonts
from the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/visuals/32588/the-next-big-thing-in-online-type/&#34;&gt;ClearType Font Collection&lt;/a&gt;, without installing Microsoft Office.
It&#39;s possible to do that via Microsoft&#39;s &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://zjhzxhz.com/2014/01/install-microsofts-consolas-font-on-mac-os-x/&#34;&gt;Open XML File Format Converter for Mac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 2½-year-old machine feels faster and more responsive after the clean install.
I upgraded my late-2013 work MacBook Pro to Yosemite a couple of months ago,
without seeing a difference in performance,
so I attribute the improvement to getting rid of a lot of crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Whyte&#39;s &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camulod_Chronicles&#34;&gt;Camulod Chronicles&lt;/a&gt; is a series of novels
about King Arthur and Camelot in a post-Roman Britain.
This book tells how Lancelot (Clothar the Frank) came to Camulod and met Arthur—and it takes the entire book to get to that point.
Only after several hundred pages of Clothar&#39;s childhood and early manhood
and fighting a civil war in his uncle&#39;s small kingdom in Gaul,
do we proceed to Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2007/01/29/ReviewUther.html&#34;&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; and other books in the series,
I found Whyte to be extraordinarily long-winded.
He can tell a story and hold one&#39;s attention,
but he spends too long doing it.
Recommended primarily for completists.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve always been an avid—nay, avaricious—reader of books.
But I have not been a listener of audiobooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read quickly, much more quickly than anyone can speak,
and I enjoy burying my head in a book.
I&#39;ve seen little reason, therefore, to listen to audiobooks.
Lately, however, we&#39;ve listened to some audiobooks on long car trips,
as Emma, unlike me, has an &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.audible.com/&#34;&gt;Audible&lt;/a&gt; subscription.
We enjoyed &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://mobile.audible.com/pd/Mysteries-Thrillers/The-Hot-Rock-Audiobook/B003N9T8SA&#34;&gt;The Hot Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the first of the comic crime-caper &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dortmunder&#34;&gt;Dortmunder&lt;/a&gt; books.
Before that, I had read another Dortmunder novel, &lt;em&gt;Bank Shot&lt;/em&gt;, aloud to Emma,
while she drove us back from Portland,
which both of us had enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our trip to Vancouver earlier this week,
we started listening to &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://mobile.audible.com/pd/Mysteries-Thrillers/The-Beekeepers-Apprentice-or-On-the-Segregation-of-the-Queen-Audiobook/B00HST3AW6&#34;&gt;The Beekeeper&#39;s Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;,
the first of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Russell_%28character%29&#34;&gt;Mary Russell&lt;/a&gt; novels about the protégé and wife of Sherlock Holmes.
The recording is 12 hours long, so we&#39;re continuing to listen to it
even though we&#39;re back in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#39;t be giving up reading any time soon,
but I do foresee listening to the occasional audiobook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Pages: 464&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Keywords: mystery, supernatural&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Reading period: 12–13 January, 2015&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective Inspector Tony McLean of the Edinburgh Police has multiple deaths to deal with:
an elderly rich man, murdered horribly;
the newly discovered corpse of a girl killed in some ghoulish ritual sixty years ago;
and the the death of the grandmother who raised him.
Then more elderly men start being murdered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this police procedural and I liked the character of Tony McLean.
The two cases start dovetailing together (one of my pet peeves)
and I was surprised when the author introduced supernatural elements,
since I had thought it was a straight crime novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discovered &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.adessobistro.net/&#34;&gt;Adesso Bistro&lt;/a&gt; just around the corner
from where we&#39;re staying in the West End of Vancouver.
It was very quiet tonight, with only one other table occupied while we were there
and another table leaving as we arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the Prix Fixe menu of Gnocchi, Brasato (braised beef), and Panna Cotta.
Emma wasn&#39;t feeling too well,
so she had a light salad and half a mushroom pizza.
Both the food and the service were very good.
We&#39;d certainly go again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/12/Vancouver.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re spending a few days in Vancouver.
&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; Vancouver.
The Canadian city in British Columbia.
Not to be confused with the large Canadian island,
Vancouver Island, just a few miles away,
or the American city of Vancouver, Washington,
which is a suburb of Portland, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like to come up to Vancouver a couple of times a year.
It&#39;s only 140 miles from Seattle,
but you have to cross the U.S.–Canadian border
and the highway runs out about ten miles from downtown Vancouver,
so it always takes at least three hours to drive up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, we&#39;re staying on the edge of
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Park&#34;&gt;Stanley Park&lt;/a&gt;,
one of Vancouver&#39;s greatest assets.
Stanley Park comprises the western half of the downtown peninsula.
Thankfully the city&#39;s founders had the foresight to set it aside as a park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we spent the afternoon walking past marinas and along part of the seawall.
This evening, we joined a local friend for dinner.
Tomorrow, we might visit the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.botanicalgarden.ubc.ca/&#34;&gt;UBC Botanical Garden&lt;/a&gt;.
Wednesday, we&#39;ll return to Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sherlock Seattle 2015</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/10/SherlockSeattle2015.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://www.sherlock-seattle.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Sherlock Seattle 2015&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/content/binary/SherlockSeattle2015Logo.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.sherlock-seattle.org/&#34;&gt;Sherlock Seattle&lt;/a&gt; is a convention for fans of Sherlock Holmes,
in all his many incarnations.
Emma and I are attending the 2015 convention this weekend at the Broadway Performance Hall.
We also attended the two previous conventions, in late 2012 and late 2013.
Holmes has always been popular,
since &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle&#34;&gt;Arthur Conan Doyle&lt;/a&gt; wrote &lt;em&gt;A Study in Scarlet&lt;/em&gt; in 1886.
Three recent adaptations have boosted Holmes&#39; popularity considerably,
the steampunk &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_%282009_film%29&#34;&gt;Sherlock films&lt;/a&gt; with Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law;
the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_%28TV_series%29&#34;&gt;BBC Sherlock&lt;/a&gt; in modern-day London with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman;
and the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_%28TV_series%29&#34;&gt;CBS Elementary&lt;/a&gt; in modern-day New York with Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Seattle has, I&#39;d guess, about 150 attendees.
Probably 90% of them are female and half of them are under 30.
(This must be a little what it&#39;s like for a woman to attend most technical conferences.)
Although many attendees were already fans of the books or earlier adaptations,
like the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_%281984_TV_series%29&#34;&gt;Granada Sherlock Holmes&lt;/a&gt; with Jeremy Brett,
a lot were drawn in by the three recent adaptations.
From the cosplay, the artwork on sale, the dealers&#39; room, and the fan fiction,
the Cumberbatch and Freeman &lt;em&gt;Sherlock&lt;/em&gt; is the undisputed favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t attend many conventions, but it&#39;s not a bad way to spend a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danny Boyle is growing up in Dublin in the 1960s and 1970s,
watched over by his grandmother.
First as she raises him, then from beyond the grave.
Danny, as his parents did before him, is making a mess of his life,
and he&#39;s a small-time drug dealer with some big problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Dublin, about a decade behind Danny Boyle,
so I enjoyed Murphy&#39;s evocation of Dublin in the 1970s.
However, I disliked his constant changing of viewpoint
and frequent hopping back and forth across the timeline.
Although he attempts some heavy topics—drugs, IRA violence, changing social &lt;em&gt;mores&lt;/em&gt;—I found the book rather lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Glassy Eyed</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/08/Spectacles.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.alternet.org/economy/why-eyewear-industry-incredible-rip&#34;&gt;Why the Eyewear Industry Is An Incredible Rip-Off&lt;/a&gt;
reminds me that I need to get some new glasses.
I had my eyes tested last month and there is a small change in the prescription.
I&#39;ve had my current glasses for about six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From ages 12 to 44, I needed only distance lenses for my myopia,
but then in the space of just a few months,
I developed the classic problem of middle age:
it became hard for me to read.
I got a pair of glasses with &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.allaboutvision.com/lenses/progressives.htm&#34;&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt; lenses.
I was used to having fairly clear peripheral vision
and I had to learn to turn my head rather than my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite some of the warnings in the comments on the article about the eyewear industry,
I think I&#39;ll try ordering some glasses online and see how they work out for me.
I&#39;ll get a pair of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.allaboutvision.com/cvs/computer_glasses.htm&#34;&gt;computer glasses&lt;/a&gt;, since I stare at screens all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dyshidrotic Eczema</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/07/DyshidroticEczema.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyshidrosis&#34;&gt;Dyshidrosis&lt;/a&gt; (/dɪs.haɪˈdroʊ.sɨs/,
also known as &amp;quot;acute vesiculobullous hand eczema,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;cheiropompholyx,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;dyshidrotic eczema,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;pompholyx,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;podopompholyx&amp;quot;)
is a skin condition that is characterized by small blisters on the hands or feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;      — &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyshidrosis&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve occasionally had little blisters
appear on my fingers and palms in hot weather in the past.
These vesicles are filled with clear liquid, annoying and a little bit sore,
and they sting when my hands are soaked in water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, they came back and they were larger and more swollen than ever before.
My doctor diagnosed a case of dyshidrotic eczema
and prescribed &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobetasol_propionate&#34;&gt;clobetasol propionate&lt;/a&gt; ointment.
The eczema promptly cleared up, but I had peeling skin on my fingertips
for weeks after I stopped using the ointment.
Clobetasol apparently thins the skin and prolonged use is not recommended.
For weeks I rubbed Vaseline into my hands to help the peeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a milder recurrence just after Christmas.
Again, the ointment cleared up the eczema quickly
and again the peeling skin persists long after.
It&#39;s annoying but I can live with it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/06/MattTaibbiAtTownHallSeattle.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/george_v_reilly/16034447237&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Matt Taibbi signing books at Town Hall Seattle&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7519/16034447237_bc77758d40_n.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to hear &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Taibbi&#34;&gt;Matt Taibbi&lt;/a&gt;
speak at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://townhallseattle.org/&#34;&gt;Town Hall Seattle&lt;/a&gt; tonight.
He spoke about the topic of his new book,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Divide:_American_Injustice_in_the_Age_of_the_Wealth_Gap&#34;&gt;The Divide&lt;/a&gt;,
which covers inequality in the United States.
After several years of covering white-collar crime in Wall Street
after the financial collapse of 2008,
and not seeing &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; prosecutions,
he got curious about what the criminal justice system is like for the poor.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-nypds-work-stoppage-is-surreal-20141231&#34;&gt;Community policing&lt;/a&gt;
is harsh in many poor communities,
like Ferguson and Staten Island,
where the police regularly issue tickets for minor infractions.
Those being summonsed can ill-afford the fines,
often leading to worse consequences.
The U.S. prison population is now twice as high as it was in 1991
and four times as high as 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marsh Tanner is a San Francisco private investigator.
His secretary Peggy is starting to unravel,
as she&#39;s been getting sexually harassing phone calls for months,
which she&#39;s hidden from Marsh.
Thing is, she&#39;s also started to develop a case of
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome&#34;&gt;Stockholm syndrome&lt;/a&gt;
with her stalker.
Marsh discovers more about Peggy—and himself—than he really wants to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderately enjoyable.
I found the plot and the characters plausible,
unlike so many modern stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first volume of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleese&#34;&gt;John Cleese&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s autobiography
takes us through the first 30 years of his life,
from his birth in Weston-super-Mare in 1939
to the creation of Monty Python&#39;s Flying Circus in 1969.
I learned along the way
that his mother was impossible;
that the Pythons consider themselves writers first, performers second;
that he greatly enjoyed his school years;
quite a lot about the various TV and radio shows he worked on before Python;
not much about his first marriage to Connie Booth;
and that his speech in
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fish_Called_Wanda&#34;&gt;A Fish Called Wanda&lt;/a&gt; about
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095159/quotes?item=qt0320193&#34;&gt;the English been stifled and terrified of embarrassment&lt;/a&gt;
was truly heartfelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to the next volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to step down as the webmaster of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://nwcpp.org/&#34;&gt;Northwest C++ Users&#39; Group&lt;/a&gt;
after serving for four years.
The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://nwcpp.org/2013-website-refresh.html&#34;&gt;NWCPP website is built&lt;/a&gt;
with the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.getpelican.com/&#34;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; static site generator.
I don&#39;t know who will succeed me as webmaster,
but it&#39;s likely that they&#39;ll be a Windows user.
Pelican runs fine on Mac and Linux,
but Windows support has never been great in Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been trying to make sure that Pelican can generate the NWCPP website on Windows.
That simple goal cascaded into a series of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I had to update the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/nwcpp/pelican-site/blob/master/README.rst&#34;&gt;website README&lt;/a&gt;,
to clarify the instructions about virtualenvs
and custom installation of various packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I had to update my stale &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import/pull/25&#34;&gt;ghp-import pull request&lt;/a&gt;, which adds Windows support.
Ghp-import is used to publish the website&#39;s content on the &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I tried to get the website to build on Windows.
It did at one point, I think, about a year ago.
At least, I removed the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/pull/1550&#34;&gt;gratuitious Unixisms&lt;/a&gt; from the Fabfile back in April,
though I only got around to submitting a pull request for it a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the website to build required several &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/georgevreilly/pelican/tree/win-paths&#34;&gt;Windows fixes for Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.
I had to fix the handling of internal links,
which use the syntax &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;{filename}path/to/file&lt;/tt&gt;.
Windows backslash path separators worked their way in to various paths,
which broke some file generation.
I thought it was working at that point,
so I built the website and published it with ghp-import,
only to find that &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://nwcpp.org&#34;&gt;http://nwcpp.org&lt;/a&gt; was no longer serving content.
I instantly realized that the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/&#34;&gt;CNAME file for GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; was missing
(having painfully debugged that issue a number of months back).
That meant that I had to fix some other path handling in Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, I tried to get the Pelican unit tests to pass,
intending to write some new ones for the changes I had made.
When I tried to &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;pip install &lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;-r&lt;/span&gt; dev_requirements.txt&lt;/tt&gt;,
I ran into problems trying to install &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://lxml.de/&#34;&gt;lxml&lt;/a&gt;.
I quickly found &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml&#34;&gt;Christoph Gohlke&#39;s Windows binary&lt;/a&gt;,
but then I had a series of problems with &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://wheel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&#34;&gt;Python Wheels&lt;/a&gt;
and updating out-of-date installations of Pip and Setuptools and Virtualenv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit tests didn&#39;t pass—of course.
The first big problem that I ran into
was that a number of tests generate a tree of content
and use &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff&#34;&gt;git diff&lt;/a&gt; to compare the output tree
with a reference copy of good output.
After I fixed the invocation of &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;git diff&lt;/tt&gt;,
I got a ton of errors, most of which were more path separator issues,
Still, I was still getting a lot of errors about
&amp;quot;LF will be replaced by CRLF ... The file will have its original line endings&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&#39;t figure out how to invoke &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;git diff&lt;/tt&gt; to ignore CRLF issues,
so I spent a couple of hours trying to compare directory trees
with &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/2/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp&#34;&gt;dircmp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html&#34;&gt;difflib&lt;/a&gt;.
That more or less worked, but I was having difficulty with
both ignoring whitespace differences, yet rendering a legible diff.
Eventually I realized that I should just use &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;git diff&lt;/tt&gt; again
but filter the errors to remove the CRLF warnings.
Hey presto, that worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing this post, I realized that the mysterious accented filenames
that I had been seeing with &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;git status&lt;/tt&gt; in my Mac&#39;s working copy of Pelican
(&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;pelican/tests/output/custom_locale/posts/2010/décembre/&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;.../201*/février/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;)
could be stopped by &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://makandracards.com/makandra/17827-git-mac-working-with-unicode-filenames&#34;&gt;setting core.precomposeunicode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All for the want of a nail...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/pull/1581&#34;&gt;Pull Request for Windows fixes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s round of fixes led me through
fixing the remaining tests;
providing a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://pythonhosted.org/six/&#34;&gt;six-based&lt;/a&gt; answer to &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/a/14298190/6364&#34;&gt;converting a filepath to a file URL&lt;/a&gt;;
more updates to the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/nwcpp/pelican-site/blob/master/README.rst&#34;&gt;website README&lt;/a&gt;;
fixing some warnings in the NWCPP website;
and finding an &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1140&#34;&gt;issue in Pip&lt;/a&gt; with unzipping paths that are not ASCII.&lt;/p&gt;
