        <title>Sherlock Seattle 2015</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/10/SherlockSeattle2015.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://www.sherlock-seattle.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Sherlock Seattle 2015&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/content/binary/SherlockSeattle2015Logo.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.sherlock-seattle.org/&#34;&gt;Sherlock Seattle&lt;/a&gt; is a convention for fans of Sherlock Holmes,
in all his many incarnations.
Emma and I are attending the 2015 convention this weekend at the Broadway Performance Hall.
We also attended the two previous conventions, in late 2012 and late 2013.
Holmes has always been popular,
since &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle&#34;&gt;Arthur Conan Doyle&lt;/a&gt; wrote &lt;em&gt;A Study in Scarlet&lt;/em&gt; in 1886.
Three recent adaptations have boosted Holmes&#39; popularity considerably,
the steampunk &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_%282009_film%29&#34;&gt;Sherlock films&lt;/a&gt; with Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law;
the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_%28TV_series%29&#34;&gt;BBC Sherlock&lt;/a&gt; in modern-day London with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman;
and the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_%28TV_series%29&#34;&gt;CBS Elementary&lt;/a&gt; in modern-day New York with Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Seattle has, I&#39;d guess, about 150 attendees.
Probably 90% of them are female and half of them are under 30.
(This must be a little what it&#39;s like for a woman to attend most technical conferences.)
Although many attendees were already fans of the books or earlier adaptations,
like the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_%281984_TV_series%29&#34;&gt;Granada Sherlock Holmes&lt;/a&gt; with Jeremy Brett,
a lot were drawn in by the three recent adaptations.
From the cosplay, the artwork on sale, the dealers&#39; room, and the fan fiction,
the Cumberbatch and Freeman &lt;em&gt;Sherlock&lt;/em&gt; is the undisputed favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t attend many conventions, but it&#39;s not a bad way to spend a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danny Boyle is growing up in Dublin in the 1960s and 1970s,
watched over by his grandmother.
First as she raises him, then from beyond the grave.
Danny, as his parents did before him, is making a mess of his life,
and he&#39;s a small-time drug dealer with some big problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Dublin, about a decade behind Danny Boyle,
so I enjoyed Murphy&#39;s evocation of Dublin in the 1970s.
However, I disliked his constant changing of viewpoint
and frequent hopping back and forth across the timeline.
Although he attempts some heavy topics—drugs, IRA violence, changing social &lt;em&gt;mores&lt;/em&gt;—I found the book rather lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Glassy Eyed</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/08/Spectacles.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.alternet.org/economy/why-eyewear-industry-incredible-rip&#34;&gt;Why the Eyewear Industry Is An Incredible Rip-Off&lt;/a&gt;
reminds me that I need to get some new glasses.
I had my eyes tested last month and there is a small change in the prescription.
I&#39;ve had my current glasses for about six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From ages 12 to 44, I needed only distance lenses for my myopia,
but then in the space of just a few months,
I developed the classic problem of middle age:
it became hard for me to read.
I got a pair of glasses with &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.allaboutvision.com/lenses/progressives.htm&#34;&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt; lenses.
I was used to having fairly clear peripheral vision
and I had to learn to turn my head rather than my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite some of the warnings in the comments on the article about the eyewear industry,
I think I&#39;ll try ordering some glasses online and see how they work out for me.
I&#39;ll get a pair of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.allaboutvision.com/cvs/computer_glasses.htm&#34;&gt;computer glasses&lt;/a&gt;, since I stare at screens all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dyshidrotic Eczema</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/07/DyshidroticEczema.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyshidrosis&#34;&gt;Dyshidrosis&lt;/a&gt; (/dɪs.haɪˈdroʊ.sɨs/,
also known as &amp;quot;acute vesiculobullous hand eczema,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;cheiropompholyx,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;dyshidrotic eczema,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;pompholyx,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;podopompholyx&amp;quot;)
is a skin condition that is characterized by small blisters on the hands or feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;      — &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyshidrosis&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve occasionally had little blisters
appear on my fingers and palms in hot weather in the past.
These vesicles are filled with clear liquid, annoying and a little bit sore,
and they sting when my hands are soaked in water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, they came back and they were larger and more swollen than ever before.
My doctor diagnosed a case of dyshidrotic eczema
and prescribed &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobetasol_propionate&#34;&gt;clobetasol propionate&lt;/a&gt; ointment.
The eczema promptly cleared up, but I had peeling skin on my fingertips
for weeks after I stopped using the ointment.
Clobetasol apparently thins the skin and prolonged use is not recommended.
For weeks I rubbed Vaseline into my hands to help the peeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a milder recurrence just after Christmas.
Again, the ointment cleared up the eczema quickly
and again the peeling skin persists long after.
It&#39;s annoying but I can live with it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Matt Taibbi at Town Hall Seattle</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/06/MattTaibbiAtTownHallSeattle.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/george_v_reilly/16034447237&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Matt Taibbi signing books at Town Hall Seattle&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7519/16034447237_bc77758d40_n.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to hear &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Taibbi&#34;&gt;Matt Taibbi&lt;/a&gt;
speak at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://townhallseattle.org/&#34;&gt;Town Hall Seattle&lt;/a&gt; tonight.
He spoke about the topic of his new book,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Divide:_American_Injustice_in_the_Age_of_the_Wealth_Gap&#34;&gt;The Divide&lt;/a&gt;,
which covers inequality in the United States.
After several years of covering white-collar crime in Wall Street
after the financial collapse of 2008,
and not seeing &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; prosecutions,
he got curious about what the criminal justice system is like for the poor.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-nypds-work-stoppage-is-surreal-20141231&#34;&gt;Community policing&lt;/a&gt;
is harsh in many poor communities,
like Ferguson and Staten Island,
where the police regularly issue tickets for minor infractions.
Those being summonsed can ill-afford the fines,
often leading to worse consequences.
The U.S. prison population is now twice as high as it was in 1991
and four times as high as 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marsh Tanner is a San Francisco private investigator.
His secretary Peggy is starting to unravel,
as she&#39;s been getting sexually harassing phone calls for months,
which she&#39;s hidden from Marsh.
Thing is, she&#39;s also started to develop a case of
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome&#34;&gt;Stockholm syndrome&lt;/a&gt;
with her stalker.
Marsh discovers more about Peggy—and himself—than he really wants to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderately enjoyable.
I found the plot and the characters plausible,
unlike so many modern stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first volume of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleese&#34;&gt;John Cleese&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s autobiography
takes us through the first 30 years of his life,
from his birth in Weston-super-Mare in 1939
to the creation of Monty Python&#39;s Flying Circus in 1969.
I learned along the way
that his mother was impossible;
that the Pythons consider themselves writers first, performers second;
that he greatly enjoyed his school years;
quite a lot about the various TV and radio shows he worked on before Python;
not much about his first marriage to Connie Booth;
and that his speech in
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fish_Called_Wanda&#34;&gt;A Fish Called Wanda&lt;/a&gt; about
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095159/quotes?item=qt0320193&#34;&gt;the English been stifled and terrified of embarrassment&lt;/a&gt;
was truly heartfelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to the next volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;line-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;— &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Want_of_a_Nail&#34;&gt;proverb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to step down as the webmaster of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://nwcpp.org/&#34;&gt;Northwest C++ Users&#39; Group&lt;/a&gt;
after serving for four years.
The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://nwcpp.org/2013-website-refresh.html&#34;&gt;NWCPP website is built&lt;/a&gt;
with the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.getpelican.com/&#34;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; static site generator.
I don&#39;t know who will succeed me as webmaster,
but it&#39;s likely that they&#39;ll be a Windows user.
Pelican runs fine on Mac and Linux,
but Windows support has never been great in Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been trying to make sure that Pelican can generate the NWCPP website on Windows.
That simple goal cascaded into a series of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I had to update the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/nwcpp/pelican-site/blob/master/README.rst&#34;&gt;website README&lt;/a&gt;,
to clarify the instructions about virtualenvs
and custom installation of various packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I had to update my stale &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import/pull/25&#34;&gt;ghp-import pull request&lt;/a&gt;, which adds Windows support.
Ghp-import is used to publish the website&#39;s content on the &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I tried to get the website to build on Windows.
It did at one point, I think, about a year ago.
At least, I removed the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/pull/1550&#34;&gt;gratuitious Unixisms&lt;/a&gt; from the Fabfile back in April,
though I only got around to submitting a pull request for it a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the website to build required several &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/georgevreilly/pelican/tree/win-paths&#34;&gt;Windows fixes for Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.
I had to fix the handling of internal links,
which use the syntax &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;{filename}path/to/file&lt;/tt&gt;.
Windows backslash path separators worked their way in to various paths,
which broke some file generation.
I thought it was working at that point,
so I built the website and published it with ghp-import,
only to find that &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://nwcpp.org&#34;&gt;http://nwcpp.org&lt;/a&gt; was no longer serving content.
I instantly realized that the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/&#34;&gt;CNAME file for GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; was missing
(having painfully debugged that issue a number of months back).
That meant that I had to fix some other path handling in Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, I tried to get the Pelican unit tests to pass,
intending to write some new ones for the changes I had made.
When I tried to &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;pip install &lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;-r&lt;/span&gt; dev_requirements.txt&lt;/tt&gt;,
I ran into problems trying to install &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://lxml.de/&#34;&gt;lxml&lt;/a&gt;.
I quickly found &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml&#34;&gt;Christoph Gohlke&#39;s Windows binary&lt;/a&gt;,
but then I had a series of problems with &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://wheel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&#34;&gt;Python Wheels&lt;/a&gt;
and updating out-of-date installations of Pip and Setuptools and Virtualenv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit tests didn&#39;t pass—of course.
The first big problem that I ran into
was that a number of tests generate a tree of content
and use &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff&#34;&gt;git diff&lt;/a&gt; to compare the output tree
with a reference copy of good output.
After I fixed the invocation of &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;git diff&lt;/tt&gt;,
I got a ton of errors, most of which were more path separator issues,
Still, I was still getting a lot of errors about
&amp;quot;LF will be replaced by CRLF ... The file will have its original line endings&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&#39;t figure out how to invoke &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;git diff&lt;/tt&gt; to ignore CRLF issues,
so I spent a couple of hours trying to compare directory trees
with &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/2/library/filecmp.html#filecmp.dircmp&#34;&gt;dircmp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html&#34;&gt;difflib&lt;/a&gt;.
That more or less worked, but I was having difficulty with
both ignoring whitespace differences, yet rendering a legible diff.
Eventually I realized that I should just use &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;git diff&lt;/tt&gt; again
but filter the errors to remove the CRLF warnings.
Hey presto, that worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing this post, I realized that the mysterious accented filenames
that I had been seeing with &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;git status&lt;/tt&gt; in my Mac&#39;s working copy of Pelican
(&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;pelican/tests/output/custom_locale/posts/2010/décembre/&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;.../201*/février/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;)
could be stopped by &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://makandracards.com/makandra/17827-git-mac-working-with-unicode-filenames&#34;&gt;setting core.precomposeunicode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All for the want of a nail...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/pull/1581&#34;&gt;Pull Request for Windows fixes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s round of fixes led me through
fixing the remaining tests;
providing a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://pythonhosted.org/six/&#34;&gt;six-based&lt;/a&gt; answer to &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/a/14298190/6364&#34;&gt;converting a filepath to a file URL&lt;/a&gt;;
more updates to the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/nwcpp/pelican-site/blob/master/README.rst&#34;&gt;website README&lt;/a&gt;;
fixing some warnings in the NWCPP website;
and finding an &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1140&#34;&gt;issue in Pip&lt;/a&gt; with unzipping paths that are not ASCII.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Happy 100th Birthday to Auntie Pat</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/02/GreatAuntPatAt100.html</link>
        <description>&lt;img alt=&#34;Auntie Pat (December 2006)&#34; src=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/content/binary/GreatAuntPat.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother&#39;s mother&#39;s sister, known to all of us as Auntie Pat,
was born on January 2nd, 1915, in London.
My mother and a few other family members will join her today for her 100th birthday party.
I understand that the Queen has been notified
and will be sending a telegram of congratulations,
but can&#39;t attend in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat is frail but her mind is still good,
and she continues to live by herself in her own home in Bournemouth, England.
In the last decade, Pat has &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; emigrated to New Zealand,
but it didn&#39;t work out either time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat married only once, in her sixties,
to a Polish émigré who had served in the British forces during WW II.
She was widowed a few years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she has otherwise spent her entire life in England,
Pat&#39;s parents were Irish.
The Irish connection strengthened when Pat&#39;s sister Ethna visited cousins in Ireland
and met my grandfather.
Pat&#39;s father was a journalist, who died when Pat was a young woman (I think).
Her mother was one of the first women to graduate from an Irish university.
She too lived to a great age and died when I was about eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of my grandparents on both sides
and their siblings lived into their eighties and nineties,
but Pat is the first of my relatives to reach 100 years of age.
Sadly, the only other survivor of that generation,
Pat&#39;s younger sister Joan died last week.
There was one other sister,
Rosaleen who died young, just before Ethna&#39;s wedding, and a brother.
Desmond was an extremely mild and unworldy man
who joined the De La Salle Brothers at a young age.
Desmond died about 30 years ago, while my grandmother died 15 years ago this month.
Pat, like my grandmother, is very refined, but also quite determined—as you might expect from someone who moved around the world twice in her nineties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy 100th Birthday to Auntie Pat!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review: The Thirty-Nine Steps</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/01/ReviewThirtyNineSteps.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0082Z2904/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The Thirty-Nine Steps&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0082Z2904.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Title: The Thirty-Nine Steps&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Author: John Buchan&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Rating: $stars(4)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Copyright: 1915&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;ISBN: &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0082Z2904/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;1846373727&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Pages: 225&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Keywords: thriller, &amp;quot;shocker&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Reading period: 1 January, 2015&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Buchan&#39;s classic novel,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirty-Nine_Steps&#34;&gt;The Thirty-Nine Steps&lt;/a&gt;,
takes place in the summer of 1914,
weeks before the Great War breaks out.
Richard Hannay, who made his fortune in South Africa,
is bored of London.
When his neighbor is murdered after disclosing a spy plot to him,
Hannay is forced to go on the run
to avoid being arrested by the police or killed by the spies.
He spends much of the book hiding out in rural Scotland,
before returning to London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proto-thriller—or “shocker” as Buchan called it—is still an entertaining story.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sic Transit 2014</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2014/12/31/SicTransit2014.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In most of the world, as I write this, it&#39;s already 2015.
We in Seattle will enter the New Year in 4½ hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me personally, it was a reasonably good year.
My health remained good,
I had a new &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2013/12/17/JoiningCookbrite.html&#34;&gt;job&lt;/a&gt;,
we had a good summer vacation,
and generally enjoyed ourselves.
Emma&#39;s health was not so great,
but she&#39;s set up an &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.etsy.com/shop/emmasimonesworkshop&#34;&gt;Etsy shop for her knitting&lt;/a&gt;
and started modeling for artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog 2014</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2014/12/30/Blog2014.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My DasBlog-based blog at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/&#34;&gt;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/&lt;/a&gt;
has been out of commission for months.
I&#39;ve been meaning to replace it for a long time,
but I only just got around to making a serious effort,
as I realized that otherwise I would have no posts at all for 2014.
I received only a handful of complaints about its absence;
if there had been more, I would have fixed it sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://dasblog.codeplex.com/&#34;&gt;DasBlog&lt;/a&gt; is a fairly lightweight blogging engine that runs on ASP.NET.
It doesn&#39;t require a database,
but it does require the ability to write XML blogpost entries to the local filesystem.
That&#39;s a non-standard configuration for ASP.NET and IIS websites,
which inevitably causes problems.
Whenever the hosting company moved my site to another machine,
the blog always required special handholding to get it running again.
The CTO of the hosting company has graciously hosted several sites of mine
at no cost for a decade, for which I&#39;m thankful.
(I worked for him at another company in the mid–90s.)
Although DasBlog has served me well for that decade,
I&#39;ve grown tired of it and of dealing with hosting problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m in the process of moving the blog to a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2014/05/the-updated-big-list-of-static-website-generators-for-your-site-blog-or-wiki.html&#34;&gt;static website generator&lt;/a&gt;,
where I generate all the HTML and other files on my own computer,
and upload those generated files to the website.
Since there&#39;s no dynamic code running on the server,
there&#39;s very little to break down—or to be broken into.
I did this &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://nwcpp.org/2013-website-refresh.html&#34;&gt;two years ago&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://nwcpp.org/&#34;&gt;Northwest C++ Users&#39; Group website&lt;/a&gt;,
when I moved it from a hosted instance of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.joomla.org/&#34;&gt;Joomla&lt;/a&gt; CMS
to a static website generated by &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.getpelican.com/&#34;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of static site generators exist,
but I had two criteria that reduced the list to three contenders,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://posativ.org/acrylamid/&#34;&gt;Acrylamid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.getnikola.com/&#34;&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.getpelican.com/&#34;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.
The SSG &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to support &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html&#34;&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt; markup
and I strongly preferred that it be implemented in Python,
as that&#39;s been my primary language since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have all 800+ of my old blog posts in reStructuredText files.
My old process had been to craft a reST-formatted blog post in Vim locally,
then to paste the generated HTML into DasBlog&#39;s edit form.
The new process is still to edit the post locally,
but then to run a command to deploy the updated content.
I&#39;m a developer.
I&#39;m far more comfortable with reST and Vim and Git and command-line tools
than I am with writing in some second-rate HTML WYSIWYG editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had extensive experience with Pelican, thanks to the NWCPP website.
It works well enough for a pure blog, where you always want the latest post first,
but its support for a mixed website where you have other articles is weaker.
Also, it&#39;s slow at rebuilding the website since it rebuilds all files
whenever there&#39;s a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played briefly with Nikola over Thanksgiving
and I no longer recall why I preferred Acrylamid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acrylamid is faster than Pelican,
though its diagnostics when you have a syntax error are not great.
I don&#39;t much care for the default theme but I&#39;ve been too busy to try another one yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainly over the last few days,
I&#39;ve been trying to port my content over to Acrylamid.
First, I extracted permalinks
from a copy of the original blog which is running in a Windows virtual machine
by spidering through all the posts.
Then I associated those permalinks with the original reST posts,
though many yet remain to be updated.
Finally, I&#39;ve been working on a script that modifies the original posts
so that they&#39;re structured in the way that Acrylamid wants them,
with the right reStructuredText metadata at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The permalinks aren&#39;t quite right,
as they all end in &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;.html&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;.aspx&lt;/tt&gt;,
and of course they&#39;re currently on the wrong domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now, I&#39;m hosting this at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://georgevreilly.github.io/&#34;&gt;http://georgevreilly.github.io/&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.
I may later point the &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;www.georgevreilly.com&lt;/tt&gt; domain to GitHub Pages,
or I may set up my own Linux server later at Linode or AWS or somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the NWCPP website, which is a Project Pages site at GitHub Pages,
this site is a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/&#34;&gt;User Pages&lt;/a&gt; site.
The net effect of that is that I have to publish to the &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;master&lt;/tt&gt; branch
of my Git repository instead of the &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; branch,
which threw me at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m reasonably happy with the results so far, but more cleanup is required.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Joining CookBrite</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2013/12/17/JoiningCookBrite.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://cookbrite.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;CookBrite&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://cookbrite.com/images/cookbrite_logo.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday December 10th was my last day at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.cozi.com&#34;&gt;Cozi&lt;/a&gt;.
I had recently rolled off a major project that lasted for most of a year,
and the timing was good to go do something else.
In my six years there,
I made lasting friendships and I built a lot of software that makes me proud.
Cozi has about 15 engineers, small enough that I worked on most of the software,
notably on the web services that power everything else
and on the web client application,
though not, alas, on the iOS or Android applications.
Cozi was a great place to work
and I knew I wanted to replicate what I valued there,
working with a team of engineers that I liked and respected,
building interesting software in a variety of technologies,
at a small company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my job search just before Thanksgiving,
expecting to spend several weeks,
but I didn&#39;t reckon with the demand in the Seattle market
for experienced software developers.
I sent out several applications
and heard very little during Thanksgiving week.
The next week, my job search caught fire.
In the space of a little more than 24 hours,
I had set up interview loops or informationals with CEOs at four different startups.
I gave notice at Cozi later that week,
as it was apparent that I would be leaving soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had heard back from all of the startups where I interviewed by Thursday of last week.
After considering their offers,
I accepted a position at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://cookbrite.com/&#34;&gt;CookBrite&lt;/a&gt;,
a stealth-mode early-stage startup in Pioneer Square,
where I will be one of the first developers.
I&#39;ve never joined a company so early before and I&#39;m looking forward to the opportunity.
The founders have done a lot of planning and market research,
and I like what they&#39;ve shown me.
I start there on Thursday, December 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that there was more demand than supply in the Seattle software market,
but I was still blindsided by the speed at which this came together.
There are a lot of jobs for talented software developers.
All modesty aside, I do have a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/in/georgevreilly&#34;&gt;great résumé&lt;/a&gt;.
In fact, CookBrite first contacted me a couple of weeks before I started looking,
via &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://careers.stackoverflow.com/&#34;&gt;Stack Overflow Careers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside my tech bubble, I know it&#39;s not so easy to find work.
Many of my friends are struggling on the margins,
as are millions of others, in America and elsewhere.
I wish I could spread some of that employability fairydust around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I&#39;m taking a few days off before starting my new job.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sample ASP Components: now at Github</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2013/12/12/SampleASPComponentsNowAtGithub.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/1861001207/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Beginning ATL 3 COM Programming&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1861001207.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From October 1996 to May 1997, I wrote a number of sample components
for the then-new &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages&#34;&gt;Active Server Pages&lt;/a&gt;
(Classic ASP).
I worked for MicroCrafts, a consulting company in Redmond, WA;
the samples were written for Microsoft&#39;s
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services&#34;&gt;Internet Information Server&lt;/a&gt;
(IIS) team.
Most of the components used Microsoft&#39;s new
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Template_Library&#34;&gt;Active Template Library&lt;/a&gt; (ATL),
a C++ library for COM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work had two important consequences for me:
Microsoft recruited me to join the IIS development team
to work on improving ASP performance for IIS 3,
and Wrox Press invited me to write
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1861000111/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1861000111&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;Beginning ATL COM Programming&lt;/a&gt;
I was originally supposed to be the sole author of the book,
but I was a slow writer and I was caught up in the IIS 4 deathmarch,
so Wrox brought in three more co-authors to complete the book.
A fourth co-author was brought in for the second edition,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1861001207/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1861001207&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;Beginning ATL 3 COM Programming&lt;/a&gt;.
As for IIS, I spent seven years on the team,
where in addition to leading the performance team,
I also worked on the
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/a2a45c42-38bc-464c-a097-d7a202092a54.mspx?mfr=true&#34;&gt;http.sys&lt;/a&gt;
kernel driver that was released in Windows Server 2003 (IIS 6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, these components could be found at
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/sample-ASP-components.html&#34;&gt;http://www.georgevreilly.com/sample-ASP-components.html&lt;/a&gt;.
I&#39;m making them available now at
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/georgevreilly/sample-ASP-components&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Turn off Windows Defender on your builds</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2013/11/11/TurnOffWindowsDefenderOnYourBuilds.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve spent some time this evening profiling a Python application on Windows,
trying to find out why it was so much slower than on Mac or Linux.
The application is an in-house build tool which reads a number of config files,
then writes some output files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.vrplumber.com/programming/runsnakerun/&#34;&gt;RunSnakeRun&lt;/a&gt; Python profile viewer on Windows,
two things immediately leapt out at me:
we were running &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;os.stat&lt;/tt&gt; a lot
and &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;file.close&lt;/tt&gt; was really expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick test convinced me that we were &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://docs.python.org/2/library/stat.html&#34;&gt;stat-ing&lt;/a&gt; the same files over and over.
It was a combination of explicit checks and implicit code,
like &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;os.walk&lt;/tt&gt; calling &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;os.path.isdir&lt;/tt&gt;.
I wrote a little cache that memoizes the results,
which brought the cost of the &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;os.stats&lt;/tt&gt; down from 1.5 seconds to 0.6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out why closing files was so expensive was harder.
I was writing 77 files, totaling just over 1MB, and it was taking 3.5 seconds.
It turned out that it wasn&#39;t the UTF-8 codec or newline translation.
It was simply that &lt;em&gt;closing&lt;/em&gt; those files took far longer than it should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to try a different profiler, hoping to learn more.
I downloaded the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh448170.aspx&#34;&gt;Windows Performance Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;.
I recorded a couple of traces of my application running,
then I looked at them in the Windows Performance Analyzer,
whereupon I saw that in each case, the CPU spike of my app
was followed by a CPU spike in MsMpEng.exe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-vista-tips/what-is-msmpeng-exe/&#34;&gt;What&#39;s MsMpEng.exe&lt;/a&gt;? It&#39;s Microsoft&#39;s antimalware engine,
at the heart of Windows Defender.
I added my build tree to the list of excluded locations,
and my runtime &lt;em&gt;halved&lt;/em&gt;.
The 3.5 seconds of file closing dropped to 60 milliseconds,
a 98% reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of this story is:
don&#39;t let your virus checker run on your builds.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review: Backbone.js Testing</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2013/10/24/ReviewBackbonejsTesting.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://www.packtpub.com/backbonejs-testing/book&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Backbone.js Testing&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://images.amazon.com/images/P/178216524X.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Title: Backbone.js Testing&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Author: Ryan Roemer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Rating: $stars(4.5)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Publisher: Packt&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Copyright: 2013&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;ISBN: &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/178216524X/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;178216524X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Pages: 168&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Keywords: programming, testing, javascript, backbone, mocha, chai, sinon&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Reading period: October 2013&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.packtpub.com/backbonejs-testing/book&#34;&gt;Backbone.js Testing&lt;/a&gt; is a short, dense introduction
to testing JavaScript applications with three testing libraries,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/&#34;&gt;Mocha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://chaijs.com/&#34;&gt;Chai&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://sinonjs.org/&#34;&gt;Sinon.JS&lt;/a&gt;.
Although the author uses a sample application
of a personal note manager written with &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://backbonejs.org/&#34;&gt;Backbone.js&lt;/a&gt;
throughout the book, much of the material
would apply to any JavaScript client or server framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/&#34;&gt;Mocha&lt;/a&gt; is a test framework that can be executed in the browser or by &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://nodejs.org/&#34;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;,
which runs your tests.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://chaijs.com/&#34;&gt;Chai&lt;/a&gt; is a framework-agnostic &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development&#34;&gt;TDD&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development&#34;&gt;BDD&lt;/a&gt; assertion library.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://sinonjs.org/&#34;&gt;Sinon.JS&lt;/a&gt; provides standalone test spies, stubs and mocks for JavaScript.
They complement each other and the author does a good job of explaining
when and how to use each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve written a lot of tests in Python (&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html&#34;&gt;unittest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/&#34;&gt;mock&lt;/a&gt;, primarily)
and C# (&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.nunit.org/&#34;&gt;NUnit&lt;/a&gt;), but my experience with JavaScript unit testing
was both limited and years out of date.
The JavaScript ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly,
with new browser frameworks and Node packages springing up everywhere.
JavaScript has some particular challenges in testing—notably, the DOM, asynchrony, and callbacks.
Mocha, Chai, and Sinon meet those challenges, though they can&#39;t take away all the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author describes how to test Backbone models, views, and collections;
dealing with asynchrony;
provides useful testing heuristics, including isolating components to reduce dependencies;
when to use stubs and mocks and fake servers;
and test automation with &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://phantomjs.org/&#34;&gt;PhantomJS&lt;/a&gt;.
He does not, however, teach you Backbone.js itself; for that, you&#39;ll need another book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few areas which I thought were dealt with too lightly.
There&#39;s no real discussion of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development&#34;&gt;Test-driven_development&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development&#34;&gt;Behavior-driven_development&lt;/a&gt;,
which provide the intellectual foundations of much of the book.
Nor does he have much to say about &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testability&#34;&gt;testability&lt;/a&gt; and how to make
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_code&#34;&gt;legacy code&lt;/a&gt; more testable.
The sample Notes app has plenty of testing &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/08/by-miko-hevery-so-you-decided-to.html&#34;&gt;seams&lt;/a&gt;
(much of this falls naturally out of the architecture of Backbone);
other people&#39;s apps are not so lucky.
The chapter on automation is extremely terse—it could be expanded into a very large book!—but it does provide useful indicators to many areas for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot from this book and I have no hesitation in recommending it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: Thanks to &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://backbone-testing.com/&#34;&gt;Ryan Roemer&lt;/a&gt; and Packt for a review copy of this book.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adapting Penelope, part II</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2013/01/21/AdaptingPenelopePartII.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://karenswhimsy.com/the-odyssey.shtm&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The Odyssey :: The Meeting of Ulysses and Penelope&#34; src=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/content/binary/the-odyssey-7.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, I read the first third of the chapter.
Tonight I will read more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I described it as “badly punctuated.”
There&#39;s no punctuation at all!
No apostrophes, no commas, no periods.
The “sentences” are separated by paragraph breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Molly Bloom has thought back to Mrs Riordan,
an obnoxious elderly neighbor whom Leopold Bloom flattered;
sickness;
Bloom&#39;s infidelities, present and past;
her own seductions and confessions;
sex and childbirth;
jealousy;
aggravating husbands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second paragraph:
men are all so different;
how strange Bloom is;
Bloom is “mad on the subject of drawers”;
their first sexual encounter;
punctuality;
a potential singing trip to Belfast with both Bloom and Blazes Boylan, her paramour;
her last concert;
hating politics;
money;
well-dressed men;
losing weight, face lotion, and beauty on the wane;
the sordid books he brings her;
Bloom could do better than his advertising job;
Bloom thinking he knows a lot about women&#39;s dress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course lots more that I didn&#39;t note here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Static Website Conversions</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2013/01/20/StaticWebsiteConversions.html</link>
        <description>&lt;img alt=&#34;Webmaster&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/Users/georger/website/gvr-blog-acrylamid/content/blog/2013/01/20/nwcpp-website-refresh.html/content/binary/webmaster_globe.jpeg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;!-- http://webdezero.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/globe-webmaster.jpg --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve spent time over the last three weeks
working on a new website for the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://nwcpp.org/&#34;&gt;Northwest C++ Users&#39; Group&lt;/a&gt;.
I blogged about the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://nwcpp.org/2013-website-refresh.html&#34;&gt;NWCPP website refresh&lt;/a&gt; over there.
In brief, I moved the website
from an instance of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.joomla.org/&#34;&gt;Joomla&lt;/a&gt; Content Management System at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.justhost.com/&#34;&gt;Just Host&lt;/a&gt;
to a static website generated by &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.getpelican.com/&#34;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; and hosted at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;,
and I&#39;m happy with the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only am I the Webmaster (and Secretary) of NWCPP,
I am also the webmaster for several other organizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/&#34;&gt;Wild Geese Players of Seattle&lt;/a&gt;,
a static HTML site badly in need of a makeover
(I&#39;m the Director, Dramaturg, and Webmaster).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.freelyspeaking.org/&#34;&gt;Freely Speaking Toastmasters&lt;/a&gt;,
a dynamic site based on the horrid &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.toastmastersclubs.org/welcome/&#34;&gt;FreeToastHoast 2.0&lt;/a&gt; software;
also our &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://freelyspeaking.easy-speak.org&#34;&gt;Easy-Speak&lt;/a&gt; club management site
(Webmaster/Immediate Past President).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.binetseattle.org/&#34;&gt;BiNet Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, a small static HTML site
(Webmaster/Past President).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://tcdalumnipnw.org/&#34;&gt;TCD Alumni PNW&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.tumblr.com/&#34;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; blog
(Webmaster/Founder).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And my &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/&#34;&gt;personal site&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/&#34;&gt;personal blog&lt;/a&gt;;
the blog is based on &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.dasblog.info/&#34;&gt;dasBlog&lt;/a&gt;
but all the content is authored in &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html&#34;&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m seriously considering converting the Wild Geese site and
my personal site to &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.getpelican.com/&#34;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.
As I said in the conclusion of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://nwcpp.org/2013-website-refresh.html&#34;&gt;NWCPP website refresh&lt;/a&gt; post,
it works for me,
but it wouldn&#39;t be suitable for someone who isn&#39;t familiar
with reStructuredText, Git, and Python.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adapting Penelope, part I</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2013/01/20/AdaptingPenelopePartI.html</link>
        <description>&lt;img alt=&#34;Ulysses&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_coFoAhVunLs/RyTM3WKQROI/AAAAAAAAALM/za9o4PekL3M/s400/ulysses+redux.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We at the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/&#34;&gt;Wild Geese Players of Seattle&lt;/a&gt; have been adapting
James Joyce&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; for staged readings since 1998,
and we will complete the book with the Penelope chapter
(aka Molly Bloom&#39;s soliloquy) on Bloomsday 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shall detail my dramaturgical process over several blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first step is to re-read the chapter.
It&#39;s been several years since I last read it and I don&#39;t remember it clearly.
I&#39;ve yet to look at my old friends, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520253973?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;Gifford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415138574?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;Blamires&lt;/a&gt;,
for their takes on “Penelope”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly is lying in bed, daydreaming early on the morning of June 17th, 1904.
Leopold climbed in to bed a little while ago,
put his head at her feet (as always) and fell asleep.
Her mind skits all over the place
in a &lt;em&gt;tour de force&lt;/em&gt; of stream of consciousness,
reliving the past in nine enormously long, badly punctuated sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shall have to figure out how to break this up,
so that our readers have something to work with.
For the sake of the audience and the readers,
I shall try to tease themes out of the sentences.
We usually have a dozen or so readers,
more than half of them male.
The boys would prefer not to sit on the sidelines
and I&#39;m certainly not having them read in Monty Python falsettos,
so some reverse-Shakespearean casting is likely.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>30 Years of Programming</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2012/01/26/30YearsOfProgramming.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Apple ][&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/82/Apple_II_tranparent_800.png/261px-Apple_II_tranparent_800.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 years ago today, I sat down at a computer for the first time,
and I wrote my first program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in Fifth Year of secondary school in Ireland—the equivalent of eleventh grade.
Personal computers were just coming into Ireland;
few people had them.
I had been taking an extracurricular course in computer programming,
in the school&#39;s physics lab.
We wrote code on paper at our desks, as there were no computers in the room.
Somehow, I hadn&#39;t realized that there was another room with computers,
in a normally off-limits part of the school, until late January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I sat down at a computer, I was hooked.
&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;PRINT 2+2&lt;/tt&gt;? &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;!
Writing code on paper was boring.
This thing was fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were five Apple ][s in that room and eight regulars, if I remember correctly.
I spent a lot of time after school in that room over the next few months.
I became comfortable with AppleSoft BASIC
and I wrote some sloppy 6502 assembly language.
(Over the next seven years, I wrote a lot of very tight 6502 code.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to that point, I had some vague notion that I wanted to be a scientist.
Now I knew I wanted to work with computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, I got my first summer job so that I could buy a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro&#34;&gt;BBC Micro&lt;/a&gt;.
I worked as a car park (parking lot) attendant at a supermarket,
standing out in the rain all day long,
charging customers for the privilege of parking while buying groceries.
It was so traumatic that I&#39;ve never had a non-computer job since—and only the following summer&#39;s job required no programming skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished secondary school in 1983 and applied, successfully,
to study Computer Science at Trinity College Dublin.
I had a part-time job over the next five years,
writing software for RTÉ, the Irish national TV station.
I had one full-time job in Ireland.
I came to the States in 1989 and got a Masters in Computers Science at Brown.
I moved to Seattle in 1992 to work for Microsoft.
I left Microsoft the following year, though I later went back.
I&#39;ve spent the last 20 years in the Seattle software industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve written a lot of code over the last 30 years.
I still get a thrill out of creating elegant software.
I&#39;ve written code that&#39;s shipped on every Windows box in the last decade—&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/a2a45c42-38bc-464c-a097-d7a202092a54.mspx&#34;&gt;http.sys&lt;/a&gt; is available from Windows XP Service Pack 3 onwards—and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.vim.org/&#34;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; comes with every Linux and Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea that day that I had changed my life, that I had found my vocation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Christmas Pudding</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2011/12/17/ChristmasPudding.html</link>
        <description>&lt;img alt=&#34;Christmas Pudding&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mg65-sFQ_JE/SzEzwa436zI/AAAAAAAAAAs/CR6r3SPOSdg/s320/xmaspudding281106_228x269.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional Irish Christmas Pudding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recipe comes from my mother, who has used it for many years.
I added the soaking of the fruit in hot water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This amount makes one large pudding and two smaller ones (4–5 quarts),
so scale down to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick a sprig of holly in the top before bringing to the dinner table.
When it&#39;s placed on the dinner table,
heat a tablespoon of brandy or whisky over a flame until it catches fire,
then pour over the pudding.
Turn down the lights to enjoy the blue-tinged flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve with &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://allrecipes.com/recipe/brandy-butter-hard-sauce/&#34;&gt;Brandy Butter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&#34;1&#34; class=&#34;docutils&#34;&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width=&#34;18%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;col width=&#34;82%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign=&#34;top&#34;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1 lb&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Raisins&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1 lb&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sultanas&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1 lb&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;currants&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1 lb&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;suet (if you can&#39;t get suet, you could use ½lb butter)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;¾ lb&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;mixed peel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;½ tsp&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;powdered nutmeg&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;½ tsp&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;cinnamon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;¼ lb&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ground almonds&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;½ lb&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;brown sugar&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;small glass&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;brandy (whiskey would do)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;pinch&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;salt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4 apples&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;minced&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6 ozs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;cherries (can be assorted colours)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;11 or 12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;eggs beaten&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1 lb&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;breadcrumbs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;¼ lb&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;plain flour&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place the fruit in a mixing bowl
and cover with boiling water.
Add whiskey or brandy.
Stir well.
Let the fruit soak overnight, stirring occasionally.
Keep covered.
It will plump up considerably.
An hour before baking, drain the fruit thoroughly.
Be sure to press out excess liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mix all ingredients together and stir well. Grease bowls.
I put two layers of tinfoil on top and tie with string.
Cook for approx 9 hours (doesn&#39;t have to be consecutive).
You can steam them but be careful not
to let the water boil away. What I do now is to put them
standing in a roasting tray in the oven in about two inches
of water and top up the water when necessary. Medium oven,
about 150C or 300F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just heat on the day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The 1911 Census</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2011/04/03/The1911Census.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the 100th anniversary of the 1911 census of the United Kingdom,
which was taken on the night of Sunday, April 2nd.
Ireland was still part of the UK and hence was included in the census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The census results are online.
The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_of_Ireland,_1911&#34;&gt;Irish results&lt;/a&gt; are freely browsable.
The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.1911census.co.uk/&#34;&gt;UK results&lt;/a&gt; cost money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of my grandparents were born in the 18 months following the census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;George Clery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My maternal grandfather, George Victor Clery, was born on March 30th, 1900.
He died on March 3rd, 1965, twelve days before I was born.
I am called George after him and Vincent after my father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generations of Clerys worked for the Munster &amp;amp; Leinster bank,
which became Allied Irish Bank in the late 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Kilkenny/Callan_Urban/Green_Street/562382/&#34;&gt;Clery census form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethna MacDonagh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother&#39;s mother, Ethna MacDonagh, was born on April 28th, 1911.
Her parents had moved from Ireland to London a few years earlier.
Her father Francis was a journalist and died, I think, when she was a young woman.
Her mother Hannah died when I was 8.
Hannah was one of the first women to graduate from an Irish university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_v_reilly/4668493750/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;MacDonagh census form&#34; src=&#34;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4011/4668493750_a72df55384.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patrick Reilly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick “Paddy” Reilly was born on June 3rd, 1911,
to a well-to-do farmer, near Kells, Co. Meath.
He was one of 10 children; nine survived.
The last brother, Richard “Dick” O&#39;Reilly, lives near Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paddy studied medicine at Trinity College Dublin but never finished.
He spent most of his career selling tyres for Goodyear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kathleen Taylor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father&#39;s mother, Kathleen Taylor, was born on August 1st, 1912.
Her father was later a supplier to the Irish Dept of Defence, I believe.
“Gam”, as we called her, was always secretive about her age
and would be horrified that I&#39;ve told you.
She dyed her hair black until the day she died, six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
