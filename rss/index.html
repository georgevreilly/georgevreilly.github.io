        <title>Review: Independence Day: Resurgence</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/24/ReviewIndependenceDayResurgence.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day:_Resurgence&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Independence Day: Resurgence&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/58/Independence-Day-2-poster.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Title: Independence Day: Resurgence&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Director: Roland Emmerich&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Rating: ★ ★&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Released: 2016&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Keywords: sf&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Watched: 24 June, 2016&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I watched &lt;em&gt;Independence Day 2&lt;/em&gt;,
I disliked it more and more,
to the point where I was seething with anger
at the stupidity of the plot and the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original 1996 &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(1996_film)&#34;&gt;Independence Day&lt;/a&gt; was at least a watchable B-movie.
The sequel is leaden and plodding and makes no sense.
The characters are perfunctory and uninteresting,
while the comic reliefs are teeth-grindingly irritating.
You might assume that the young pilot who is the son of Will Smith&#39;s character
would be the lead in this film,
but he&#39;s sidelined here by Liam Hemsworth as the Top Gun jock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My anger is primarily directed at the repeated insults the plot offered to my intelligence.
Friendly alien materializes over the moon and gets shot down immediately;
doesn&#39;t think to call ahead or to send in an emissary.
Captain Hiller flees from the moon to the Earth and goes off alone to rescue his mother—an inexcusable dereliction of duty when the Earth has just been attacked.
Old man Julius&#39;s boat somehow floats 2,000 miles on a tidal wave
from the Atlantic to Nevada—yet he&#39;s unscathed.
Pilots are sent in to bomb the mothership
and are told that HQ will wait
until they&#39;re clear before setting off the fusion bombs—it&#39;s a suicide mission; the bombs would be triggered as soon as they reach the target.
People waste time making speeches when seconds count.
The entire world is under attack,
yet we spent more time on the moon than we do anywhere else outside the US,
apart from an early scene in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On and on and on, the characters act stupidly and unbelievably
in this threadbare excuse for a plot.
Roland Emmerich, I want my money back!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bad Speakers at Meetups</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/23/BadSpeakersAtMeetups.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I&#39;ve been spoilt,
but most of the speakers at the technical meetups and conferences that I go to
have something to say and say it well.
I&#39;ve also been to hundreds of Toastmasters meetings
and I&#39;ve heard many speakers at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to a tech meetup tonight and I sat through two bad hour-long presentations.
The first speaker should have eliminated the first 20 minutes of his talk,
a self-indulgent ramble about various other projects that he had attempted,
which shed no light on his main topic.
He could easily have eliminated another 15 minutes from the rest of his talk
and it would have been the better for it.
Many people, including myself, were obviously bored
and paid more attention to their phones than the speaker.
The speaker had some mildly interesting points to share,
but I can&#39;t claim that I learned much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second talk likewise was too long.
I left before the end, after nearly half the audience had gone.
This speaker was more nervous than the first,
and he was also unfocused and disorganized.
His demos were clumsy and imparted little to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tips for would-be technical speakers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Have something to say.
Know what your point is.
What do you want us to take away from your speech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Rehearse, dammit.
Don&#39;t just write some slides.
Speaking the words aloud will focus your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Rehearse in front of someone who will give you constructive feedback
about your content and delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Record your rehearsal and watch the video.
Your phone has a video camera, so no excuses.
You will learn a lot from watching yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class=&#34;first docutils&#34;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Rehearse your demos even more than your speech.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ul class=&#34;first last simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you demoing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are you demoing this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should we care?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Are your slides &lt;em&gt;legible&lt;/em&gt; when you&#39;re standing at least 10 feet away from your monitor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Get to the room early and debug the inevitable problems with projectors and audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Advice often given to writers is to
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://writeroutine.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-to-kill-your-darlings.html&#34;&gt;kill your darlings&lt;/a&gt;—remove the parts of your manuscript that you may love
but which do not advance the plot.
Likewise, remove extraneous slides and bullet points from your presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Review: Flashman</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/22/ReviewFlashman.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0452259614/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Flashman&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0452259614.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Title: Flashman&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Author: George MacDonald Fraser&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Rating: ★ ★ ★ ★ ½&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Publisher: Plume&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Copyright: 1969&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;ISBN: &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0452259614/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;0452259614&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Pages: 256&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Keywords: historical fiction, humor&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Reading period: 13–18 June, 2016&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brigadier-General Sir Harry Flashman,
celebrated Victorian soldier,
winner of the Victoria Cross,
survivor of the charge of the Light Brigade,
the battle of Little Big Horn,
and the raid on Harper&#39;s Ferry,
reveals himself in this frank memoir published long after his death
to be “a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward—and, oh yes, a toady.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central conceit of the fictional &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flashman_Papers&#34;&gt;Flashman Papers&lt;/a&gt;
is that Flashy, writing frankly in his old age about his remarkable set of adventures,
is perfectly willing to put himself in a bad light,
because he was an unabashed rogue and a poltroon who was never caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first novel in the series and it reveals how Flashman first made his name.
Later novels were not published in chronological order.
Fraser, having set down the mileposts of Flashman&#39;s life in the first book,
filled them in as the mood took him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young Flashman is expelled from Rugby School for beastly drunkeness,
an episode taken from &lt;em&gt;Tom Brown&#39;s School Days&lt;/em&gt;.
His father buys him a commission in a regiment of dragoons,
but he disgraces himself and is sent to India and thence to Afghanistan,
where he gets caught up in the First Anglo-Afghan War.
He is one of the few survivors of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1842_retreat_from_Kabul&#34;&gt;1842 retreat from Kabul&lt;/a&gt;,
the debacle also known as Elphinstone&#39;s Massacre.
He is mistakenly believed to have performed heroically—those who knew otherwise having all been killed—and so becomes a major celebrity upon his return to England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraser is a master storyteller and Flashman is a marvelous character,
entertaining yet rotten, cruel yet compelling, boorish yet endearing.
It&#39;s many years since I first this book and it&#39;s still enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deploying Docker Containers on AWS, part 3</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/18/DeployingDockerContainersOnAWSPart3.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I complained &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/18/17/DeployingDockerContainersOnAWSPart2.html&#34;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; about my difficulties in deploying Docker containers on AWS.
I have since succeeded in getting my app to deploy on ElasticBeanstalk,
though I have not quite ironed out all the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found several problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to revert from a Multi-Container Docker environment
to a Single-Container Docker environment
because ECS wasn&#39;t starting in the multi-container environment.
That meant I had to revert to a v1 &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;Dockerrun.aws.json&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to ensure that the Instance Profile had the
AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly policy attached,
so that I could pull from the EC2 Container Repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Deploying Docker Containers on AWS, part 2</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/17/DeployingDockerContainersOnAWSPart2.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I complained &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/05/24/DeployingADockerContainerOnAWS.html&#34;&gt;a few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; about how hard it was to deploy Docker containers on AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week has been nothing but container-related frustration.
We have two apps running in Kubernetes clusters on top of AWS.
This is not a well-supported scenario and we have a fragile script
that spends a lot of time sitting in polling loops,
waiting for various things to happen like DNS updates taking effect,
the new cluster being available, and so on.
One of the apps has decided to stop deploying.
I do not know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been trying to get a new app deployed on ECS, the EC2 Container Service.
The way to deploy an updated app is to take an existing Task Definition,
update the tag on the image name, and create a new revision.
I have not figured out the right incantation to get the cluster service
to start running the new task consistently,
much less how to do this without any downtime.
It&#39;s insanely difficult to bring up a new cluster,
or, more specifically, to configure an EC2 instance for the new cluster.
There&#39;s a huge list of non-obvious pieces that need to be configured.
I discovered that you could append &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;#/firstRun&lt;/tt&gt; to the URL
to get the first-run wizard to reappear.
That causes no less than 15 pieces of AWS infrastructure to start up,
which is significantly more than you get when you create an ECS cluster the other way.
However, the ELB Load Balancer is not configured correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried going back to ElasticBeanstalk,
since we&#39;ve successfully deployed a Docker container on EB for the last two years.
I realized that the way to bootstrap a new environment is to upload &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;Dockerrun.aws.json&lt;/tt&gt;.
However, I have yet to get the new environment to start up correctly.
I SSHed into the EC2 instance and found that the Docker daemon wasn&#39;t running
and refuses to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/17/18/DeployingDockerContainersOnAWSPart3.html&#34;&gt;fixed some problems with ElasticBeanstalk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very, very unhappy with AWS this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Behrends wakes up after a party at a drug dealer&#39;s house on Ibiza
with a gun in his hand,
no memory of the last few hours,
and a roomful of dead people.
He goes on the run,
and soon encounters a Russian hitman
who&#39;s looking for his abducted 12-year-old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictable plot, cardboard characters.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Final Bloomsday Rehearsal</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/15/FinalBloomsdayRehearsal.html</link>

we had one more rehearsal to go before
our &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2016.html&#34;&gt;2016 Reading&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; for Bloomsday.
That was tonight.
Mostly we worked out seating and other logistics.
We are intercutting two different chapters,
with the readers playing different roles in each chapter,
so it&#39;s a small but satisfying accomplishment
to have a seating arrangement that works for both chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pulse Massacre, Day 3</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/14/PulseMassacreDay3.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote this last night on Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even 25 years after coming out as bisexual,
I still censor myself and still check myself about coming out yet again.
Even though Seattle is about as safe as it gets
and most people here are queer-friendly, it&#39;s reflexive.
And even in Seattle, queer bashings happen.
We came very close to an even bigger tragedy in a gay nightclub in Seattle
on New Year&#39;s Eve 2013,
when an arsonist lit a fire in Neighbours while 750 people were present.
The fire was promptly detected and put out,
no-one was injured, and the perpetrator is in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became aware of my sexuality in a very different time and place—Ireland, about 1980—when it very much was not alright to be out.
I don&#39;t think those scars will ever completely heal.
I know that many of my friends here have much deeper scars than I,
thanks to beatings, harassment, disownment, violent rejection,
lost jobs, lovers and friends lost to AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, a friend remarked:
&amp;quot;I don&#39;t understand.
The way you are reacting, it&#39;s almost like you knew someone in the club.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the thing you need to understand
about every LGBT person in your family, your work, and your circle of friends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve spent most of our lives being aware that we are at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hear interviewers talking to LGBT folks and they say
&amp;quot;It could have been here.
It could have been me,&amp;quot;
they aren&#39;t exaggerating.
I don&#39;t care how long you&#39;ve been out,
how far down your road to self acceptance and love you&#39;ve traveled,
we are always aware that we are at some level of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m about as &amp;quot;don&#39;t give a shit what ANYONE thinks&amp;quot;
as anyone you&#39;ll ever meet...
and when I reach to hold Matt&#39;s hand in the car?
I still do the mental calculation of
&amp;quot;ok, that car is just slightly behind us so they can&#39;t see,
but that truck to my left can see right inside the car&amp;quot;.
If I kiss Matt in public, like he leaned in for on the bike trail the other day,
I&#39;m never fully in the moment.
I&#39;m always parsing who is around us and paying attention to us.
There&#39;s a tension that comes with that...
a literal tensing of the muscles as you brace for potential danger.
For a lot of us, it&#39;s become such an automatic reaction
that we don&#39;t even think about it directly any more.
We just do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then... over the last few years, it started to fade a little.
It started to feel like maybe things were getting better.
A string of Supreme Court decisions.
Public opinion shifting to the side of LGBT rights.
Life was getting better.
You could breathe a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened with this event is pretty dramatically demonstrated
by how Matt and I are reacting to it.
Matt came out fairly late, during the golden glow of the changing tide.
He&#39;s never dealt with something like this.
It&#39;s literally turned him inside out emotionally
because all that stuff he read about that was just &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; became very much &amp;quot;NOW&amp;quot;.
For me, I&#39;ve had some time to adjust to the idea that people hate us enough to kill us.
Matthew Shephard was my first real lesson in that.
So this weekend was a sudden slap in the face,
a reminder that I should never have let my guard down,
should never have gotten complacent...
because it could have been US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every LGBT person you know knows what I&#39;m talking about.
Those tiny little mental calculations we do over the course of our life add up...
and we just got hit with a stark reminder that those simmering concerns, those fears...
they probably won&#39;t ever go away.
We&#39;ll never be free of them.
Additionally, now we just got a lesson that expressing our love
could result in the deaths of &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt; completely unrelated to us.
It&#39;s easy to take risks when it&#39;s just you and you&#39;ve made that choice.
Now there&#39;s this subtext that you could set off someone
who kills other people who weren&#39;t even involved.
And that&#39;s just a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s why I&#39;m personally a bit off balance
even though (or because, depending on how you look at it)
I live in Texas and was not personally effected by this tragedy.
Don&#39;t get me wrong: nothing will change.
I will still hold my husband&#39;s hand in public.
I will still kiss him in public.
We&#39;ll still go out and attend functions and hold our heads high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we will be doing those mental calculations for the rest of our lives.
Those little PDAs you take for granted with your spouse.
They come with huge baggage for us.
Every single one is an act of defiance, with all that entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So do me a favor. Reach out to that LGBT person in your life.
Friend, co-worker, or family.
Just let them know you are thinking of them and you love them.
That will mean the world to them right now. I promise you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Pulse Massacre, Day 2</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/13/PulseMassacreDay2.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent the last 90 minutes reading Facebook,
and my feed has been absolutely overwhelmed with Orlando-related posts,
be they grieving, discussing homophobia, calling for gun control,
or reacting to reactions.
I&#39;ve never seen such a skewed set of posts.
Some of it is surely Facebook catering to what it knows are my interests,
but it seems like the vast majority of my friends
and the pages that I follow can talk of nothing else.
Even Trump/Clinton/Sanders articles, except as they pertain to this,
have temporarily disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have seen nothing useful from Republican politicians
regarding gun control or homophobia.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>50 Murdered in Orlando</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/12/50MurderedInOrlando.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I woke up this morning to news of another American massacre:
a lone gunman had murdered 50 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando,
and injured another 53 people.
It was the worst mass shooting in US history and also the worst hate crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put it out of my head for the afternoon while I attended an old friend&#39;s wedding,
but it&#39;s been at the forefront of my mind ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in America could we put up with massacre after massacre,
yet not find the political will to do anything meaningful about gun violence.
Craven politicians in thrall to the NRA mouth platitudes,
but will not make any changes.
We banned box cutters and bottles of liquid on planes after single incidents,
yet somehow we cannot do anything to reduce the number of guns
or to restrict the ease with which they can be bought,
no matter how many people are shot each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same politicians who refuse to do anything about guns
are also the ones who&#39;ve been whipping up fear about the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt;:
building a wall to keep Mexicans out,
banning transsexuals from bathrooms,
screaming to ban Muslims,
whipping up racial animus against black people.
The drumbeat of hatred and fear grows ever louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to a vigil tonight at Cal Anderson Park on Capitol Hill,
which gave me some hope that there are people of good will out there.
We need more people to say &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;, loudly and implacably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Reading period: 3–10 June, 2016&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simple_Art_of_Murder&#34;&gt;The Simple Art of Murder&lt;/a&gt; comprises the essay of the same name
and four early non–Philip Marlowe stories (in some editions, there are eight stories).
The essay is justifiably famous and worth reading;
the stories are of middling quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All are available online:
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.en.utexas.edu/amlit/amlitprivate/scans/chandlerart.html&#34;&gt;The Simple Art of Murder Essay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/chandler__spanish_blood__en.htm&#34;&gt;Spanish Blood&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/chandler__ill_be_waiting__en.htm&#34;&gt;I&#39;ll be Waiting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/chandler__the_king_in_yellow__en.htm&#34;&gt;The King in Yellow&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/chandler__pearls_are_a_nuisance__en.htm&#34;&gt;Pearls are a Nuisance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the essay, Chandler takes aim at the sterile confections of deduction
that comprised most detective fiction written in the 1920s and 1930s,
which “do not really come off intellectually as problems,
and they do not come off artistically as fiction.”
He contrasts that with the realistic style of Dashiell Hammett,
who “gave murder back to the kind of people that commit it for reasons,
not just to provide a corpse;
and with the means at hand,
not with hand-wrought duelling pistols, curare, and tropical fish.”
He concludes:
“In everything that can be called art there is a quality of redemption.
It may be pure tragedy, if it is high tragedy, and it may be pity and irony,
and it may be the raucous laughter of the strong man.
But down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean,
who is neither tarnished nor afraid.
The detective in this kind of story must be such a man ...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pearls are a Nuisance&lt;/em&gt; is a story of the kind that Chandler complained about.
More precisely, it&#39;s a parody of such stories,
with a well-spoken gentleman teaming up with a hard-drinking ruffian
to retrieve the purloined pearls of Mrs Penruddock.
It&#39;s the weakest story in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other three stories are classic Chandler,
tales of moral ambiguity that are whydunnits, not whodunnits.
In &lt;em&gt;Spanish Blood&lt;/em&gt;, a hardboiled cop investigates the political murder of an old friend.
&lt;em&gt;I&#39;ll be Waiting&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s sad house detective tries and fails to save a man.
&lt;em&gt;The King in Yellow&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s private eye
discovers a mess of frameups and revenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://howwegettonext.com/without-an-address-youre-no-one-51704526f558#.z8obtkdwg&#34;&gt;Without an Address, You’re No One&lt;/a&gt; introduced me to &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://what3words.com/&#34;&gt;What3Words&lt;/a&gt;,
an innovative system that uses just three English words to address
any 3m×3m square on the planet.
These words are drawn from a 40,000-word vocabulary.
A 3m×3m square is precise enough to identify a particular doorway in a large building
or a towel on a crowded beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent much of my childhood living at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://w3w.co/uses.pills.crunch&#34;&gt;uses.pills.crunch&lt;/a&gt; (Dublin).
I spent ten years working at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://w3w.co/navy.clear.poems&#34;&gt;navy.clear.poems&lt;/a&gt; (Microsoft&#39;s Redmond campus).
If I pinpointed the buildings that I worked in,
they would each have completely different w3w addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me a little of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/01/07/DicewareAndLastpass.html&#34;&gt;Diceware&lt;/a&gt; which strings together several words
to form an easy-to-remember but hard-to-crack password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said “English words” above but I lied.
W3w is actually available in multiple languages,
though many of them use a 25,000-word vocabulary,
which omits the seas.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hillary Clinton, presumptive nominee</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/09/HillaryClintonPresumptiveNominee.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee for the 2016 Presidential race.
Although Sanders has not yet ended his campaign, he can&#39;t win.
I voted for Sanders in the Washington state caucus
and I still have his yard sign sitting in my front yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike some diehard Sanders&#39; supporters,
I have absolutely no qualms getting behind Clinton.
She&#39;s one of the most qualified candidates ever to run.
If elected, she will be on the right side of many of the issues I care about
and she will make good appointments to the Supreme Court.
She&#39;s competent and capable and gets things done.
Clinton has survived more scrutiny and more attacks than just about anyone else.
She&#39;s not perfect:
for example, she&#39;s closer to Wall Street than I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I compare her to Donald Trump,
to his utter unfitness for office,
to his dangerous bellicosity,
to the appointments he&#39;d make,
to his denial of climate change,
it&#39;s a very, very easy decision for me to support Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillary for President!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bloomsday Approaches</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/08/BloomsdayApproaches.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote in &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/03/27/PreparingBloomsdayScripts.html&#34;&gt;Preparing Bloomsday Scripts&lt;/a&gt; back in late March,
that I was getting ready for this year&#39;s reading of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;.
Our &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2016.html&#34;&gt;2016 Reading&lt;/a&gt; is a week and a half away, on Sunday June 19th.
We&#39;ll be reading Chapters 3 (“Proteus”) and 6 (“Hades”)
of James Joyce&#39;s masterpiece at the Seattle Central Library.
We had our first full readthrough at tonight&#39;s rehearsal,
one hour fifty five minutes.
Next week, our dress rehearsal.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A New Car</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/07/ANewCar.html</link>
        <description>&lt;img alt=&#34;George &amp;amp; Emma with new Mazda 3&#34; src=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/content/binary/GeorgeEmmaNewMazda.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve bought only three cars in my life:
a new red VW Golf in April 1992, when I moved to Seattle;
an 18-month-old black VW Golf in April 2002;
and a 2007 Mazda 3 in April 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2001 VW was still running fine and had recently passed the 150,000-mile mark.
However, it, like the 1992 Golf, had a manual transmission (a “stick shift”).
Emma had a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mortons-neuroma/home/ovc-20202652&#34;&gt;Morton&#39;s Neuroma&lt;/a&gt; removed from the ball of her left foot around 2003.
It seems to be coming back
and she was having increasing difficulty depressing the clutch.
Between the ever-increasing traffic in Seattle and Seattle&#39;s steep hills,
drivers need to change gear often.
It was time to replace the car with an automatic.
We only have one car because I don&#39;t often need one,
since I cycle or take transit to work.
I had planned to drive this car for many more years,
so I was sad to give it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a sizeable tax refund this year
and we went car shopping the day after Emma&#39;s birthday.
We quickly found a car that we liked.
Aside from comparatively high mileage—almost 140,000 miles—it was in superb condition.
The previous owner must have been neurotic about keeping the interior spotless.
In comparison to some other used cars we saw
where there was no doubt that the interiors were well used,
this one looked as if it had been hardly driven.
We&#39;ve since driven it up to Vancouver BC and down to Portland OR,
and we&#39;re still very happy with it.
I look forward to many years&#39; use from this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sold our faithful 2001 VW to Raven and Iain,
who badly needed a second car,
since they now live north of Marysville.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detective Inspector Fin McLeod hasn&#39;t been back
to the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis&#34;&gt;Isle of Lewis&lt;/a&gt; in twenty years,
but he&#39;s been seconded to the task force investigating a murder.
The dead man had bullied Fin and his friends throughout their childhood.
Returning home brings up a lot that had been long buried: secrets and resentments.
Fin&#39;s childhood and youth is gradually revealed throughout the book,
informing his present-day investigation.
He acted badly in the past and that has not been forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May skillfully weaves these two tales together,
revealing details of character and plot,
all the while evoking the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.visitouterhebrides.co.uk/see-and-do/culture-and-heritage/peter-may-lewis-trilogy&#34;&gt;rugged beauty of the Hebrides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of March, I read an article in the &lt;em&gt;Irish Independent&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/the-girl-who-stole-my-book-how-eilis-ohanlon-found-out-her-crime-novels-were-swiped-by-a-stranger-34561638.html&#34;&gt;The girl who stole my book&lt;/a&gt;,
about a blatant case of plagiarism.
A Kindle All Star author by the name of Joanne Clancy
had taken two books written by Ingrid Black a decade earlier,
and rewritten them in her own words,
changing the names and adjectives
but preserving the plot.
Eilis O&#39;Hanlon, one half of the pseudonymous duo behind Ingrid Black,
only found out about the plagiarism by accident,
thanks to a tweet from a sharp-eyed reader.
O&#39;Hanlon wrote about the experience at more length in &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E7M5NMQ/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;The Real Book Thief&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saxon is a former FBI agent,
now living in Dublin and sleeping with Detective Chief Superintendent Grace Fitzgerald.
Ed Fagan, a serial killer last heard of five years ago, is back,
sending letters to the newspaper and claiming fresh victims.
But Saxon knows that Fagan is dead—because she killed him and buried him—so who&#39;s passing himself off as Fagan?
She just barely manages to be invited in as a consultant on the case.
The killer is clever and elusive and leaves a bloody trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from her lover, Saxon has few friends, and is not liked by the Gardaí.
She keeps everyone at bay with her biting wit and hardboiled attitude.
Still, she&#39;s an interesting character and the plot was good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Panel on Marriage Equality</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/04/PanelOnMarriageEquality.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/1806979636191540/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Panelists and Irish Network members&#34; src=&#34;https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/13391474_1633546976970055_6097193358846557945_o.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 800px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was supposed to be a second showing of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/02/ReviewTheQueenOfIreland.html&#34;&gt;The Queen of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; documentary
this morning at the SIFF Uptown,
preceded by a panel discussion on Marriage Equality.
We attended the discussion,
which was moderated by Phil Grant, the Consul General of Ireland.
The three panelists were
Rory O&#39;Neill, aka Panti Bliss, out of drag,
the accidental activist who became the face of marriage equality in Ireland;
Mayor Ed Murray, an Irish-American and Washington state&#39;s best-known gay politician;
and Gary Gates, an LGBT demographer, married to an Irishman,
who advised the Irish campaigners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a strong interest in marriage equality,
going back more than 20 years—I was wearing a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://lgbtweekly.com/2015/04/29/special-commentary-the-hawaii-heroes/&#34;&gt;HERMP&lt;/a&gt; shirt that I bought in 1993 at Thursday&#39;s premiere.
I worked on the technical teams
for both the 2009 Approve Referendum 71 campaign,
which saved Washington state&#39;s domestic partnership bill,
and the 2012 Approve Referendum 74 campaign,
which saved Washington&#39;s equal marriage bill.
I hold treasured of winning those campaigns
and of watching from afar as Ireland said &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/05/23/ireland-yes-on-marriage-equality.html&#34;&gt;Yes to Marriage Equality&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On principle, putting civil rights up to a popular vote
didn&#39;t sit well with the panel, or with me.
Different circumstances forced such votes
both in Ireland and in Washington in 2009 and 2012.
In the Irish case,
the language of the Irish Constitution had to be changed,
which required an amendment.
In Washington,
both referenda were ballot initiatives
designed to repeal legislation previously enacted by state lawmakers.
As Ed Murray reminded us,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-fourth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland&#34;&gt;Ireland&#39;s referendum&lt;/a&gt; passed with overwhelming approval,
winning in all but one constituency,
whereas &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Referendum_74&#34;&gt;Referendum 74&lt;/a&gt; barely passed in Washington,
where the more liberal cities around Puget Sound
outvoted conservatives in the rest of the state.
He also reminded us that Marriage Equality had the support of all major Irish political parties,
whereas there&#39;s a major partisan divide in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed said that he personally knew Republican politicians who supported equality,
but who couldn&#39;t be seen to do so by their voters.
Gary said that part of his work had been to assemble economic arguments,
which in some cases gave the necessary cover to such politicians to do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rory mentioned that he had assumed that after the Irish referendum,
that life would go on much as before save that same-sex couples could get married.
In fact, he found that gay couples had become much more willing to hold hands in public
and that this continued a year after the referendum.
In the Irish case,
the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/chrissy-curtin/pantigate-an-illustrated-timeline-dafef882b0be&#34;&gt;Pantigate&lt;/a&gt; scandal in early 2014
had occasioned a major national conversation
around homophobia and censorship.
This had benefited the 2015 equality campaign,
as most people now realized that they knew
LGBT people in their family or their neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also mentioned that he reminds Irish gays that it&#39;s not so good elsewhere.
Panti had appeared in Sarajevo a month ago
and the theater there had to arrange extra security,
as that part of the world remains virulently homophobic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of transphobic bathroom bills came up.
It&#39;s the opinion of both Ed Murray and Joe McDermott
that &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2016/04/28/24021548/washington-wont-discriminate-packs-the-pews-to-fight-anti-trans-ballot-initiative-1515&#34;&gt;Initiative 1515&lt;/a&gt; will get enough signatures to be on the ballot in November.
This would amend Washington&#39;s 2006 anti-discrimination law.
I asked later who was leading the fight against I-1515:
answer, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.washingtonwontdiscriminate.org/&#34;&gt;Washington Won&#39;t Discriminate&lt;/a&gt;.
I also asked about the state of marriage equality in Northern Ireland.
Rory said that the DUP are misusing &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/18/northern-ireland-gay-community-democratic-unionst-party-marriage-equality-tactical-voting&#34;&gt;petitions of concern&lt;/a&gt; to veto progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway through the panel discussion,
the power abruptly went out in the cinema.
It turned out that power would be out for several hours—despite City Light getting a prompt call from the mayor who was sitting right there—and the second showing of &lt;em&gt;The Queen of Ireland&lt;/em&gt; is postponed until 10am Sunday.
We continued the discussion in the near dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a photo session outside afterwards, as you can see above.
I talked to Rory briefly and discovered that he&#39;s known my cousin Tom for many years.
Tom is gay and used to do drag, so this wasn&#39;t a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am heartened by the progress we&#39;ve made in the US and Ireland
in the last 20 years.
But the struggle is not over yet.
A transphobic backlash is underway around the US,
and LGBT rights are still weak in much of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collection of short stories and essays from Kate Elliott,
some of which are drawn from her various story universes.
In the foreword and the essays,
she discusses the cultural biases that
lead to the “male gaze” and male characters
being the unconsidered defaults for many readers and writers.
These stories amply demonstrate that good, interesting fantasy and SF stories
can be written with strong female characters and subtle plots.
(I already knew this; some in SF fandom still don&#39;t.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years in Seattle, I&#39;ve met
the Prime Minister (Taoiseach) of Ireland,
the President of Ireland,
and now the Queen of Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen_of_Ireland&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The Queen of Ireland&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/PantiBliss.jpg/440px-PantiBliss.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Keywords: documentary, ireland, lgbt&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Watched: 2 June, 2016&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen_of_Ireland&#34;&gt;The Queen of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; is a documentary about Ireland&#39;s best-known drag queen,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panti&#34;&gt;Panti Bliss&lt;/a&gt; (Rory O&#39;Neill), who became an accidental activist
and the face of marriage equality in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filming started in 2010.
In early 2014, O&#39;Neill appeared on an RTÉ chat show
and alleged that some individuals in Irish journalism are homophobic.
They threatened to sue and RTÉ backed down, apologizing and paying them €85,000.
This became known as &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/chrissy-curtin/pantigate-an-illustrated-timeline-dafef882b0be&#34;&gt;Pantigate&lt;/a&gt;.
Panti gave a “&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXayhUzWnl0&#34;&gt;Noble Call&lt;/a&gt;” speech about homophobia at the Abbey Theatre,
which went viral on Youtube,
becoming internationally known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following year,
Ireland held a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/05/23/ireland-yes-on-marriage-equality.html&#34;&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; on Marriage Equality
and became the first country to grant full rights to LGBT citizens by popular vote.
Panti was one of the most high-profile campaigners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary covers Panti&#39;s life,
from a childhood in Ballinrobe, Co. Mayo;
the blatant homophobia of Ireland during Rory&#39;s youth in the seventies and eighties;
to becoming a fledgling drag queen in Tokyo in the late eighties and early nineties;
to moving back to Ireland and becoming a fixture in Dublin&#39;s gay scene,
shepherding the Alternative Miss Ireland contest for many years;
to Pantigate, the Noble Call speech, and the Marriage campaign;
to finally a homecoming at a sold-out show in Ballinrobe.
It presents Panti, who describes herself as a “giant cartoon woman”,
as a larger-than-life figure,
and interviews her thoughtful alter ego, Rory,
who says that being Panti has made him a better person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an LGBT expatriate who grew up in Ireland at the same time as Rory,
I found it especially personal and moving,
but I think &lt;em&gt;The Queen of Ireland&lt;/em&gt; is of much wider interest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HouseCanary PyCon2016 Progamming Challenge</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/01/HouseCanaryPyCon2016ProgammingChallenge.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, while at PyCon,
I whipped up a quick, brute-force answer
to the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/housecanary/PyCon2016&#34;&gt;HouseCanary PyCon2016 Progamming Challenge&lt;/a&gt;
in a few minutes.
That was sufficient to pass the first two test cases
and win me a very pretty HouseCanary t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer ran in &lt;em&gt;O(n⁴)&lt;/em&gt; time, so it failed miserably on the larger problem sets
in the third and fourth cases.
I mulled it over and came up with an &lt;em&gt;O(n²)&lt;/em&gt; solution that runs in reasonable time
on the larger problem sets.
On the second test case, &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;input1.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, runtime drops from 5.2s to 0.2s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I submitted my new answer.
I&#39;ll learn on Monday if I won the speed challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Keywords: crime, humor&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Listening period: 27–31 May, 2016&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely listen to &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/15/Audiobooks.aspx&#34;&gt;audiobooks&lt;/a&gt;, except on long driving trips.
We listened to another &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/20/ReviewTheHotRock.html&#34;&gt;Dortmunder&lt;/a&gt; book on our drive
down to and back from Portland for PyCon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dortmunder&#39;s jinxed associate Andy Kelp spends a few days in jail
and reads a book called &lt;em&gt;Child Heist&lt;/em&gt; by Richard Stark,
which Kelp believes to be the blueprint for a perfect crime.
Dortmunder, always wary of Kelp&#39;s schemes,
doesn&#39;t appreciate having a plan brought to him,
since he&#39;s always been the planner of the crew.
Some of the crew aren&#39;t eager to kidnap a child either,
but eventually they all come around.
Unfortunately for them, the kid is much smarter than they are,
so the perfect crime fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the joke is that Westlake wrote a series of novels
about the ruthless career criminal &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_(character)&#34;&gt;Parker&lt;/a&gt; under the pseudonym Richard Stark.
&lt;em&gt;Child Heist&lt;/em&gt; is not a real Parker novel, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audiobook is very amusing with a fine performance from the narrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot was loosely inspired by the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://thewestlakereview.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/review-jimmy-the-kid/&#34;&gt;real-life kidnapping of a Peugeot heir&lt;/a&gt;.
Apparently there&#39;s a lousy &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/28/AdaptingBooksForFilmAndTV.html&#34;&gt;movie adaptation&lt;/a&gt; with Gary Coleman made in 1982,
and it was also &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://violentworldofparker.com/?p=3216&#34;&gt;filmed twice more&lt;/a&gt; in Germany and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joanna Kilbourn&#39;s husband, Ian, was senselessly murdered
along the Trans-Canada Highway six years ago.
Now the killer has been murdered in prison.
And his vile girlfriend, who was acquitted of Ian&#39;s murder, is making threats.
Then she&#39;s found dead, strangled by Joanna&#39;s scarf, and Joanna is the prime suspect.
Joanna, who is a quietly competent mother, professor, and political commentator,
starts digging and she finds things that alarm her about Ian&#39;s past,
things that she had missed in her fog of grief after his murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fine blend of domesticity, political infighting, and detection.
Joanna is a keen observer of both her family and her political colleagues,
but she too is surprised at how this story plays out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a number of updates to the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://flyingcloud.readthedocs.io/&#34;&gt;FlyingCloud Documentation&lt;/a&gt; tonight.
I hope to give a lightning talk about FlyingCloud
at PyCon on Monday evening or Tuesday morning,
and I put together some slides for that too.&lt;/p&gt;
