        <title>Toastmasters Speech Contest</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/29/</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/01/ToastmastersContestChair.html&#34;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago that I was going to be the Contest Chair
for the International Speech and Evaluation Contests
at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://freelyspeaking.org/&#34;&gt;Freely Speaking Toastmasters&lt;/a&gt;.
Those contests were tonight,
and I was both Contest Chair and Toastmaster.
The contest chair sets up everything beforehand;
the toastmaster runs the contest itself;
frequently but not necessarily the contest chair is also the toastmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m happy with how it came off.
I managed to recruit two speakers for the Speech contest
and three evaluators for the Evaluation contest,
all of whom acquitted themselves well.
I also recruited three judges, two ballot counters, one timer,
a sergeant at arms, and a test speaker
to make the contest run.
The winner of each contest will go on to the Area 31 contest on March 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One point that I forgot to make at the contest
is that a weakness of the Toastmasters&#39; system
is that most speeches are given to an audience exactly once.
Professional speakers often deliver the same speech again and again to different audiences,
burnishing it to a high luster.
For most Toastmasters&#39; speeches,
the speaker has only one opportunity to receive feedback from an audience of evaluators
and no chance to hone and improve a speech through multiple deliveries.
A club contest winner, however, will deliver the same speech again to the area contest.
If they win that, they&#39;ll repeat it at the division contest.
And if they&#39;re successful there, they&#39;ll deliver it at the district contest.
Each time, the competition is tougher
and the contestant receives feedback from their supporters,
measurably improving their speech.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adapting Books for Film and TV</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/28/AdaptingBooksForFilmAndTV.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/16747829840591346/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Turning a Book into a Movie&#34; src=&#34;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/1a/92/10/1a921046a3cc406d145e0aa43625d2f9.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across this cartoon today;
it reminded me that I&#39;ve been meaning to write
about the hit-or-miss nature of adapting books for the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books and video/film are different media,
with different conventions and needs.
Often the most-loved elements of a book are lost
when it&#39;s adapted for television or film,
upsetting fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As J.K. Rowling wrote about one of the Harry Potter movies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;It is simply impossible to incorporate every one of my storylines
into a film that has to be kept under four hours long.
Obviously films have restrictions
– novels do not have constraints of time and budget;
I can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but
the interaction of my own and my readers&#39; imaginations&amp;quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved Lev Grossman&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Magicians&lt;/em&gt; novels—&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/12/26/ReviewTheMagicians.html&#34;&gt;The Magicians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/12/27/ReviewTheMagicianKing.html&#34;&gt;The Magician King&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/12/31/ReviewTheMagiciansLand.html&#34;&gt;The Magician&#39;s Land&lt;/a&gt;—but &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_(U.S._TV_series)&#34;&gt;The Magicians TV series&lt;/a&gt; has been a major disappointment to me.
They&#39;ve butchered the flow of the first book,
turning it into an American college movie with magic elements,
removing most of the Fillory connection
and adding a gratuitous subplot about hedge witches.
I&#39;ve watched the first four episodes
and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll watch any more.
If it hadn&#39;t been an adaptation of a book that I loved,
I would not have watched more than the first episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also saw &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(film)&#34;&gt;The Watchmen film&lt;/a&gt; recently,
which suffers from being an obsessive,
panel-for-panel recreation of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen&#34;&gt;The Watchmen graphic novel&lt;/a&gt;.
Aside from one significant change at the end,
the director apparently had no independent vision of his movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve read several of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dortmunder&#34;&gt;Dortmunder books&lt;/a&gt; by Donald E. Westlake
or listened to their audiobooks,
and I love the deadpan humor of all of them.
I&#39;ve seen three movie adaptations.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hot_Rock_(film)&#34;&gt;The Hot Rock&lt;/a&gt; with Robert Redford is bearable, if uninspired,
and fairly faithful to the source.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_the_Worst_That_Could_Happen%3F&#34;&gt;What&#39;s the Worst that Could Happen?&lt;/a&gt;
with Martin Lawrence and Danny De Vito
is loosely based on the book of the same name;
it&#39;s not particularly funny.
But &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Shot&#34;&gt;Bank Shot&lt;/a&gt; with George C. Scott is truly horrible;
they attempted to turn it into some kind of zany madcap Seventies romp
and failed badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones&#34;&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/a&gt; has it about right.
The early seasons hewed closely to George R.R. Martin&#39;s books,
but felt free to drop subplots and thin out characters
without losing the essence of the source material.
As the seasons went on, the divergence widened.
We have now reached the point where the show has caught up with the books
and they&#39;re starting to strike out in new directions.
Each is its own thing; both are done well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)&#34;&gt;Harry Potter movies&lt;/a&gt; are also fairly well received
by the rabid fan base,
and are generally considered successful works in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Blood&#34;&gt;True Blood&lt;/a&gt; to be better than Charlaine Harris&#39;s books.
A fair amount of plot was taken from the books,
but it quickly grew into its own over-the-top thing,
moving in different directions.
The books suffer from the limitations of being told
from the first-person perspective of Sookie Stackhouse,
the telepathic waitress who falls in love with several vampires.
&lt;em&gt;True Blood&lt;/em&gt; can tell multiple storylines and moves around more freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commitments_(film)&#34;&gt;The Commitments&lt;/a&gt; film is superior to its source,
Roddy Doyle&#39;s first novel,
a slender little book.
The film develops the characters more fully.
The book&#39;s two sequels were also adapted into films,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snapper_(film)&#34;&gt;The Snapper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Van_(1996_film)&#34;&gt;The Van&lt;/a&gt;,
which I think are about equal to their source novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptations are hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sent an invite to &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://keybase.io/&#34;&gt;Keybase&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks, which I accepted tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a cryptographic standpoint, PGP is rock solid.
In practice, using it is very messy.
Its complexity has deterred the vast majority of people
who might otherwise benefit from using encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem is establishing a valid identity,
especially with other people located oceans away.
The second is distributing public keys
without nefarious types posting alternative keys
that appear to be registered to the same person.
...
The third issue is getting people to install and use PGP software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can now be reached via &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://keybase.io/georgevreilly&#34;&gt;https://keybase.io/georgevreilly&lt;/a&gt;.

        <title>Review: Run Fatboy Run</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/26/ReviewRunFatboyRun.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_Fatboy_Run&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Run Fatboy Run&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7a/Run_fat_boy_run.JPG&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_Fatboy_Run&#34;&gt;Run Fatboy Run&lt;/a&gt; is a Simon Pegg comedy from 2007, which we just watched.
I didn&#39;t have high hopes for it and it was better than I expected.
Dennis left a pregnant Libby (Thandie Newton) at the altar five years ago.
Now he&#39;s an overweight security guard in a London lingerie shop
and she&#39;s found a new boyfriend who&#39;s everything that Dennis is not:
Whit (Hank Azaria) is well off, handsome, and very fit.
Somehow Dennis ends up promising to run in a marathon in three weeks&#39; time
that Whit is also running in.
Much of the story revolves around his training,
his desperate attempts to win over Libby,
and his struggles with Whit, who turns out to be an arsehole.
It&#39;s funny and occasionally bittersweet and quite enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review: Hail, Caesar!</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/25/ReviewHailCaesar.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail,_Caesar!&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Hail, Caesar!&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/Hail%2C_Caesar%21_Teaser_poster.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coen Brothers&#39; latest movie, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail,_Caesar!&#34;&gt;Hail, Caesar!&lt;/a&gt;, is a lot of fun.
I&#39;ve been looking forward to it since the trailers showed up a few months ago.
It&#39;s a homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood,
an age where quirky talents like the Coens
could not have made Coen Brothers&#39; movies.
We see song and dance numbers, synchronized swimming,
singing cowboys, and ballroom dramas.
Most of all, we see a big-budget swords-and-sandals epic,
whose star, Baird Whitlock, has been kidnapped by The Future,
a group of Communist screenwriters,
and is being held for $100,000 ransom.
Eddie Mannix is the studio fixer who has to wrangle
the studio&#39;s stars and keep them out of the gossip columns.
It&#39;s one big headache but it&#39;s his calling.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Taibbi on Trump</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/24/TaibbiOnTrump.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/how-america-made-donald-trump-unstoppable-20160224&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Trump Unbound&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/2016/media/229188/_original/1456166538/1035x1407-R1256_cover.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new article for Rolling Stone, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/how-america-made-donald-trump-unstoppable-20160224&#34;&gt;Matt Taibbi excoriates Trump&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out we let our electoral process
devolve into something so fake and dysfunctional
that any half-bright con man
with the stones to try it
could walk right through the front door
and tear it to shreds on the first go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Trump is no half-bright con man, either.
He&#39;s way better than average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Trump and Cruz scare me, for very different reasons.
Trump is impulsive, all id, doesn&#39;t give a fuck,
riling up the worst impulses of the American electorate for short-term gain.
Who knows what this loose cannon will do?
Cruz is a nasty piece of work,
cold and calculating,
a hard-right conservative and a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/14/does-ted-cruz-think-he-s-the-messiah.html&#34;&gt;Dominionist&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/12/why-everyone-in-congress-hates-ted-cruz.html&#34;&gt;widely hated&lt;/a&gt; by those who&#39;ve worked with him.
They&#39;re both very dangerous
and I do not look forward to either of them winning the Presidency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I favor Bernie Sanders but I will throw my support behind Hillary Clinton,
should she win the Democratic nomination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just watched an interesting &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.realmofhistory.com/2016/02/09/rome-the-eternal-city-in-its-peak-showcased-through-a-brilliantly-animated-video/&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; that recreates Rome as it probably was circa 320 AD.
At that point, Rome&#39;s population was somewhere between one and two million people,
the largest city in Europe until 19th century London.
Constantine was Emperor and a few years later,
he would move his capital to Constantinople.
A century and a half later, the final emperors would die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve only visited Rome once, when I was ten years old.
I&#39;m long overdue for another visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Orleans, 1834.
Benjamin January is a free man of color
and a Paris-trained surgeon who must support himself as a musician.
His sister Olympe, a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Voodoo&#34;&gt;voodooienne&lt;/a&gt;, and another woman, Célie,
are accused of murdering Célie&#39;s husband,
and Ben must save them from hanging.
As a professional musician and a colored man,
Ben moves between the high society of the old French inhabitants
and the new American merchants,
the poor white areas of town,
the many slaves,
and the small free black middle class.
Hambly adeptly explores slavery,
the uneasy crossover between French and American society,
voodoo,
the nature of grief,
and unhealthy mother–son relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A body has washed up in the canals of Venice,
that of an American soldier from the nearby US base at Vicenza.
Commissario Guido Brunetti doesn&#39;t believe that it&#39;s a mugging gone wrong,
especially when he sees the fear in the eyes
of the female army doctor who&#39;s sent to identify the body.
He digs and finds corruption among the rich and powerful, in a toxic coverup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brunetti is a decent and honorable family man,
whose sense of justice is undiminished by working for
an incompetent functionary in a broken system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;San Diego cop Benny Freedman decides to meet his Belfast relatives for the first time.
They disowned his Catholic mother decades ago when she married his Jewish father.
It turns out that her siblings are still unrepentant bigots,
but he finds himself drawn to two of his cousins,
pretty young Catherine Callahan
and Brendan O&#39;Malley, a poet whose brother Sean has just been murdered.
Cousin Benny finds himself drawn into internecine feuding between the IRA and the INLA,
as well as skirmishes against the British Army and loyalist gangs.
Brendan, an IRA cell leader, has his own designs upon Catherine
and he becomes jealous that she is drawn to Benny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of the plot are wildly improbable—Benny has been made a multimillionaire twice
by the two dead women that he mourns from earlier adventures,
not to mention the way that he draws trouble.
Still, the plot moves along at a good pace.
Benny, though he is troubled to find himself aiding republican violence,
also despairs at the plight of poor Catholics during the Troubles
and at their intransigence in piling retaliation upon retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review: Mad Max: Fury Road</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/19/ReviewMadMaxFuryRoad.html</link>

&lt;p&gt;We saw &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max:_Fury_Road&#34;&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road&lt;/a&gt; at the Cinerama tonight,
as part of its &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cinerama.com/News/January-2015/Eight-Days-of-Oscar.aspx&#34;&gt;Eight Days of Oscar&lt;/a&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Fury Road&lt;/em&gt; having being nominated for ten Oscars,
including Best Picture and Best Director.
I have no idea if it will win any awards from the Academy,
but it&#39;s no ordinary action movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action there is aplenty,
a kinetic feast of racing cars and roaring maniacs
that rarely lets up.
Imperator Furiosa and Max flee across the desert,
taking Immortan Joe&#39;s five nubile wives to a better place.
They seek hope, Furiosa seeks redemption, and Max seeks mostly to survive.
Furiosa sets the plot in motion;
Max is a loner battered by fate,
grudgingly coming to the women&#39;s aid.
Furiosa is the true hero here,
though Max proves himself a hero in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London, January 1381.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Gaunt&#34;&gt;John of Gaunt&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s regency is in trouble,
unrest abounds throughout the land,
and uprisings are being plotted.
Brother Athelstan and his friend the Coroner
are invited to a performance by Gaunt&#39;s players, the Straw Men,
at the Tower of London.
When a murder occurs during the play, Athelstan is required to investigate.
Several more murders happen before he finds the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doherty pulls off both an intricate plot and a satisfying historical novel.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shamrocks Have Three Leaves, Not Four</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/17/ShamrocksHaveThreeLeaves.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Shamrock&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/content/binary/shamrock.jpg&#34; style=&#34;height: 200px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I visited a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.shawnodonnells.com/Seattle/&#34;&gt;faux-Irish bar&lt;/a&gt; this evening
where both three-leaved and four-leaved shamrocks were found in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock&#34;&gt;shamrocks&lt;/a&gt; are associated with Ireland
is that our patron saint, St. Patrick,
used the three-leaved plant
as a metaphor for the Divine Trinity,
the three gods in one,
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.
(The Irish usually refer to the Holy Spirit as the Holy Ghost.
I spent ages 7–18 at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary%27s_College,_Dublin&#34;&gt;St. Mary&#39;s College CSSp&lt;/a&gt; in Dublin,
which is run by the Holy Ghost Fathers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-leaf_clover&#34;&gt;four-leaf clover&lt;/a&gt; is considered lucky because it is rare.
It may be lucky but it is not a shamrock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Sharman is a washed up London PI,
living with two strippers and drinking himself into oblivion.
He used to be a promising Detective Constable,
and a bad case from that time comes back to haunt him.
The teenaged daughter of an inspector died after being raped twelve years ago.
His sergeant fitted up a local flasher and Sharman reluctantly went along.
Now Sailor Grant is out and wants to clear his name.
Sharman refuses to get involved; Grant is murdered;
and Sharman&#39;s former sergeant beats him half to death.
Sharman recovers and finds a web of police corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot is tight and the characters are interesting.
Recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wife of a rich politician has been kidnapped by terrorists
who want to exchange her in nine days&#39; time
for one of their number who&#39;s in prison.
Actor Bob Farran thinks he can impersonate Tom Lacey well enough
that Sally Morland will be freed and he can earn the £250,000 reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spend three quarters of the book preparing for the impersonation,
which gives Farran time to do it well.
While the nine-day delay enabled the impersonation,
it makes little sense for the terrorists to have asked for such a delay.
The exchange and the aftermath were rather anticlimactic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, Rommy &amp;quot;Squirrel&amp;quot; Gandolph—generally regarded as a harmless thief not playing with a full deck—confessed to three murders.
Now he&#39;s about to be executed
and Arthur Raven, his court-appointed attorney,
believes his protestations of innocence.
The book follows Arthur,
who finds an ally in Gillian Sullivan,
the disgraced ex-judge who presided over Gandolph&#39;s trial,
and the prosecutor, Muriel Wynn, and the detective, Larry Starczek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turow digs deep into the characters of his four protagonists,
as they struggle with each other and with the revelations of the case.
They are all flawed, scarred individuals,
most notably Gillian who still conceals that she had been a heroin addict.
While Arthur and Gillian have come to believe that Gandolph is innocent,
Larry and Muriel still believe in his guilt,
even when a dying convict claims to have framed him.
Not only are the characters interesting but the plot draws you in too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/10/EmmaAtMadronaFiberArtsFestival.html</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Emma is once again at the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://madronafiberarts.com/&#34;&gt;Madrona Fiber Arts Festival&lt;/a&gt; in Tacoma.
It&#39;s a convention of knitters, crocheters,
and practitioners of other fiber arts,
and Emma goes every year.
She takes classes and hangs out with her fellow knitters.
It&#39;s always held over Valentine&#39;s Day Weekend,
so I tease her about preferring knitting to romantic dinners with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Title: Thrones, Dominations&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Author: Dorothy L. Sayers &amp;amp; Jill Paton Walsh&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently married, Lord Peter Wimsey and the former Harriet Vane
take up residence at their townhouse.
When the beautiful wife of an acquaintance is murdered,
Peter becomes involved in the investigation.
Meanwhile, Harriet is coming to terms with having &amp;quot;married up&amp;quot;,
after fending off Peter&#39;s wooing for several years.
Should she continue her career as a mystery novelist,
now that she no longer needs the income,
or do what is expected by some: have babies and give up writing.
All of this is against the backdrop of the nation mourning the death of George&amp;nbsp;V
and of the brief reign of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII&#34;&gt;Edward VIII&lt;/a&gt;, who is soon to abdicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sayers wrote the first few chapters of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrones,_Dominations&#34;&gt;Thrones, Dominations&lt;/a&gt; in 1936,
but never completed it.
Sixty years later, Paton Walsh was asked by Sayers&#39; estate to complete it.
She does a fine job of channeling Sayers&#39; much-loved characters.
The plot is unexceptional.
The subplot of the new king&#39;s dalliance with a divorcée and with Nazi sympathizers
would not have been written by Sayers in 1936.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precedes &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/03/ReviewAPresumptionOfDeath.html&#34;&gt;A Presumption of Death&lt;/a&gt;, which I enjoyed a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MythBusters: Lead Balloon</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/08/MythBustersLeadBalloon.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/adam-savage-on-lead-balloon/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;MythBusters: Lead Balloon&#34; src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/giSZSY1.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t watch much television.
One of the few shows that I do watch is &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters&#34;&gt;MythBusters&lt;/a&gt;,
sadly now in its last season.
I watched three old shows tonight,
including one of my all-time favorites,
making a lead balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking on the adage &amp;quot;to go down like a lead balloon&amp;quot;,
Jamie and Adam set out to prove that it is possible
to make a lead balloon fly.
But it&#39;s not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After prototyping a couple of designs with aluminum foil, they move on to lead foil.
Lead foil is very hard to obtain and it&#39;s much weaker than aluminum foil.
Jamie likens it to working with wet toilet paper,
as it&#39;s so easy to tear.
They prove at small scale that it&#39;s possible to make a burrito-shaped lead balloon,
but it&#39;s too heavy to fly,
as the ratio of the volume of helium to the mass of the balloon walls is too low.
Unhappy with the burrito shape,
Adam comes up with an ingenious origami-inspired design for a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://one-sick-psi-guy.blogspot.com/2008/07/mythbuster-collapsible-cube.html&#34;&gt;collapsible cube&lt;/a&gt;,
which unfolds like a flower.
They carefully construct a 10&#39;x10&#39;x10&#39; cube from lead foil in a large hangar,
fill it with a mixture of helium and air,
and it flies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pointless but ingenious.
Myth busted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I half-watched team sports &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; today.
We got up early to go to an Irish friend&#39;s house,
to eat a full Irish breakfast and watch rugby.
I no longer detest rugby with the virulence that I had growing up,
when I attended a rugby-playing school in Dublin from ages 7 to 18,
but I&#39;m still not interested in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon, I went to a Chinese New Year&#39;s party,
which doubled as a Superbowl party.
I transferred my feelings about rugby to American football when I moved here.
I have many problems with football culture:
the worship of jocks, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steubenville_High_School_rape_case&#34;&gt;rape culture&lt;/a&gt;, homophobia, concussion.
Even if all of those could be fixed,
the game itself is interminable to watch,
worse even than baseball or cricket.
In rugby, they play two 40-minute halves;
they do not stop the clock every 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Story Sticks</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/06/StorySticks.html</link>

&lt;p&gt;I assembled a couple of adjustable shelving units today.
Trying to count the same number of indentations on all four legs for each level
quickly grew tedious, and I realized that I needed to make a story stick.
I cut a &amp;quot;stick&amp;quot; to the right length
and then I was able to place the stick along the leg
and instantly read where the next pair of snap rings should be placed.
I mentioned this to Emma and she had never heard of story sticks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodworkers have used &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.startwoodworking.com/post/using-story-sticks-build-furniture&#34;&gt;story sticks&lt;/a&gt; for a long time
to build furniture and to get reproducible results.
Instead of writing down a measurement on a sheet of paper
and later using a tape measure to cut something to that length,
the measurement is instead marked on a stick
and &lt;em&gt;transferred&lt;/em&gt; to the new piece of wood.
It&#39;s less error prone, especially if the actual measurement
is slightly off from the prescribed measurement.
A story stick often has several marks,
describing different aspects of the piece being built.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Car2go: Out of Home Area</title>
        <link>http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/05/Car2goOutOfHomeArea.html</link>
        <description>&lt;a class=&#34;reference external image-reference&#34; href=&#34;https://www.car2go.com/en/seattle/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Car2go&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/content/binary/stamp-car2go2.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve driven Car2go a couple of times this week.
On both occasions, while driving through downtown Seattle,
the car announced that I was outside its home area.
Presumably it temporarily lost a signal
and thereby assumed that it was no longer in the home area.
Given the car knew my position and direction just moments before,
and that I was well inside the home area,
any half-way decent algorithm would have concluded
that it was physically impossible for me to be now outside the home area,
and kept its mouth shut.&lt;/p&gt;
