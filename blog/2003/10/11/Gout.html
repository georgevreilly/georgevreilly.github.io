<p>I have gout. It&#8217;s an unpleasant form of arthritis. Once or twice a year,
one of my lower joints will swell up overnight. Usually, it&#8217;s struck one of
my knees, though the last few attacks have all been in my feet. The knee
attacks have all been extremely painful initially and I&#8217;ve required
pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion painkillers to get to sleep at night. Just bending my knee a
few degrees is enough to make me break out in a cold sweat. For&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly,
after a few days, the pain decreases to the point where it&#8217;s annoying but&nbsp;tolerable.</p>
<p>Oddly, the feet attacks have been less painful. I had a few pre&shy;mon&shy;i&shy;to&shy;ry
twinges in my right foot on Thursday evening, so I took a colchicine
tablet. I woke up early yesterday morning to find my foot hurting. I can
bend my big toe upwards, but it hurts to lift off from my right foot, so
I&#8217;m hobbling around stiff-footed with the help of a cane. I can drive, but
I don&#8217;t think I could manage it it were my left foot, since the clutch
requires more pressure than the ac&shy;cel&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tor or brake&nbsp;pedals.</p>
<p>This is the first time that I&#8217;ve had a gout attack in my right foot. I had
one in my left foot three weeks ago, the day that we were flying back from
our vacation in Ireland. I had only one attack in my left foot before that,
just as we were about to leave for a two-week driving vacation over last
Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing. For&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, the anti-in&shy;flam&shy;ma&shy;to&shy;ries brought it under control
quickly. Before that, I&#8217;ve had four or five attacks, always in one knee or
the other, over the last five years. I&#8217;ve never yet had an attack in the
classic locus of the big&nbsp;toe.</p>
<p>Gout is caused an excess of uric acid forming crystals in a joint. Uric
acid is a by-product of the breakdown of purines. High levels of uric acid
are due to one or more of three factors: consuming too much food which is
high in purines, the body generates too many purines, or the body is not
effective at elim&shy;i&shy;nat&shy;ing&nbsp;purines.</p>
<p>I have never consumed sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant quantities of the foods that are really
high in purines, such as organ meats and shellfish, and my con&shy;sump&shy;tion of
alcohol is quite modest. I&#8217;m probably twenty-five pounds over my ideal
weight, my blood pressure is fine, and I&#8217;m in my late thirties, so I don&#8217;t
really fit the stereotype of a fat sweaty squire, quaffing port by the
gallon, a la <a class="reference external" href="http://www.peterwestern.f9.co.uk/hogarth/hogarth25.html">Hogarth</a>.
My doctors have been telling me for over a decade
that I have a high con&shy;cen&shy;tra&shy;tion of uric acid in my&nbsp;blood.</p>
<p>Some people have a genetic pre&shy;dis&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion to gout. My father had an attack
a few years ago. My mother&#8217;s sister reportedly had an attack once or twice,
but she&#8217;s a hypochon&shy;dri&shy;ac who&#8217;s had&nbsp;everything.</p>
<p>I spent most of September and October 2002 limping around because my left
knee was swollen due to gout. I couldn&#8217;t par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pate in last year&#8217;s
Northwest <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Walk, because I couldn&#8217;t walk very far. I had expected to
walk in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aidswalk2003.org/">this year&#8217;s <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Walk</a>,
which is tomorrow, but it&#8217;s unlikely that I&#8217;ll be up for&nbsp;it.</p>
