<p>I just read an interview on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.buzzflash.com/">BuzzFlash</a>
with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/03/10/int03161.html">Bob Beckel</a>.
Beckel is a longtime
Democrat political consultant. He's now gone into the business of exposing
the right wing's dirty tactics at his website,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bobbeckel.com/">BobBeckel.com</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re in the business of exposing their tactics, some of which I’ve had
used against me before -- like mailing official government-looking
stationery to blacks in precincts in the South, telling them if they
vote in the wrong place, they’ll get a $5,000 fine and a year in jail.
It obviously drove down black turnout. That’s one that Jesse Helms’
thugs used against Harvey Gant in NC. One of the missions of
bobbeckel.com is to expose these tactics with examples, and also what a
campaign should do if something like this happens to them. The problem
for campaigns dealing with these guys is the press tends to call it a
political fight and not newsworthy.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>It seems to me that if the in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions that you’ve come to depend on,
whether they are Congress or the press, fail to do their job or expose
what is un&shy;doubt&shy;ed&shy;ly a vast Right Wing takeover of the Government, then
for those of us who understand them, who’ve been up against them, and
who’ve been victims of them – it’s our re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty to carry it
forward. And if it means having to do it the way they do it, we will.
We’re not afraid of them.</p>
<p>It’s like Richard Mellon Scaife. The reason I’m after that SOB is he’s
trying now, after trying to destroy the Clinton’s, to clean up his
image. This guy has been funding dirt projects which are then carried
out by people like those involved with the Arkansas Project, a bunch of
thugs and crooks. Then Scaife turns his back and says: I don’t know
what they’re doing. How much longer are we going to put up with that?
We can’t.</p>
