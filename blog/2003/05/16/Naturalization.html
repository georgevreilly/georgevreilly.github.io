<p>I gave the following speech to Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters on January 29th, 2003, as Speech #2, "S&shy;in&shy;cer&shy;i&shy;ty".</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">NAT&shy;U&shy;RAL&shy;IZA&shy;TION</span></p>
<p>Fellow Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters and Guests, last September, on the first
an&shy;niver&shy;sary of 9/11, I made one of the biggest decisions of my life: I
decided to apply for American cit&shy;i&shy;zen&shy;ship, to become nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;ized.</p>
<p>Like many of you, I am an immigrant. I have spent most of my adult life
in this country. Fourteen years ago, I came to the <span class="caps">US</span> from Ireland to
earn a Masters degree. I moved to Seattle in 1992, the same year that I
became a permanent resident. I have made a career here, as well as many
ties: those of friends, of family, and of assets. I met my wife here
five years ago; together we have bought a lovely house in Seattle.</p>
<p>My two brothers became <span class="caps">US</span> citizens last year. Apart from my parents and
some friends in Dublin, my ties to Ireland grow weaker every year. I
have changed and grown since I came here and Ireland has changed too.
It’s noticeably different from the country that I left, both better and
worse. I am still proud of being Irish, but I expect to spend the rest
of my life living in America.</p>
<p>It might seem to you that it should have been an obvious decision for
me to become a <span class="caps">US</span> citizen. Indeed, you might ask why I didn’t do it
much sooner. But this was not an easy decision for me. I dithered about
it for years. Only my decision to come out of the closet as a bisexual
in ‘91 was harder.</p>
<p>I put this decision off for so long because I have misgivings about
America, the swaggering bully of the world, about the outrageous
con&shy;sump&shy;tion of the planet’s resources, about the arrogance and
com&shy;pla&shy;cen&shy;cy of so many Americans who un&shy;crit&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly believe that America
is better than anywhere else.</p>
<p>I am leery of American patriotism because it is so often identified
with conformity, blind na&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ism, and militarism. America: Love It or
Leave It! My Country, Right or Wrong!</p>
<p>I am appalled by a rich country leaving 41 million of its citizens
without health insurance. I am troubled by the in&shy;tol&shy;er&shy;ance and power of
the Religious Right. I have no liking for the Bush ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion,
their war mongering, their uni&shy;lat&shy;er&shy;al&shy;ism, their crony capitalism, their
disregard for the en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment, their abrogation of rights in the name
of security.</p>
<p>This litany is so depressing that you must be wondering by now not why
it took me so long to apply for cit&shy;i&shy;zen&shy;ship, but why I haven’t fled to
a more congenial country.</p>
<p>I want to become an American because I believe in the promise of
America, in the ideals of the Founding Fathers: the in&shy;alien&shy;able rights
of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. I believe in the Bill
of Rights, in Freedom of Speech, and in the Separation of Church and State.</p>
<p>I want to become an American because for all of its flaws, America has
so much in its favor. This is a beautiful country, full of millions of
the nicest people you’d ever want to meet. Many of them are working
hard to build a better society. America provides great freedoms and
op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ties, not just to make money but to remake oneself.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech is taken seriously here: Europe has chilling libel
laws instead of the First Amendment. In the <span class="caps">US</span>, I have the right to
dissent. I can call the Clintons foul fiends from Hell or write that
Bush is a dangerous dolt, without fear that the secret police will kick
down my door one night and haul me off to the gulag. This is why
Operation <span class="caps">TIPS</span> and the Pentagon’s Office of Total In&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion Awareness
are so unAmerican.</p>
<p>In Ireland, the Catholic Church had a "special position" written into
the Con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion for several decades, though its authority has been
much diminished in recent years. In America, the principle of
Separation of Church and State means that I am free to be a godless
atheist and my wife is free to be a Wiccan. Some people may object to
that, but the state does not privilege their religious beliefs over
mine, nor mine over theirs.</p>
<p>No other country has come close to the tech&shy;no&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal ferment of Silicon
Valley. Only in America could Microsoft have been such a success. The
Internet was born here and still remains deeply American. My early
exposure to the Net in the mid-to-late Eighties played a big part in my
initial decision to come here.</p>
<p>Millions of people move here every year, making America the most
het&shy;eroge&shy;nous society in the world. For all of its flaws, this is a good
place to be! There is no perfect country! Every country, every nation
has problems.</p>
<p>Permanent residents have all the re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ties of cit&shy;i&shy;zen&shy;ship, save
that of jury duty. I pay taxes, I am subject to the laws of this
country. Had I been slightly younger when I got my green card, I would
have been required to register for the draft.</p>
<p>As a permanent resident, I also have many rights in the <span class="caps">US</span>. But there
is one right that I do not have, perhaps the most important right of
all: the vote. I have been of voting age for almost 20 years, but I
have only once had the op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ty to vote in a national election in
Ireland or the U.S, seventeen years ago in 1986.</p>
<p>Even though I have been active in the community for many years, giving
time and money to causes that I care about, I diminish myself by
forgoing the full experience of being an American.</p>
<p>Like many others, I found the events of 9/11 profoundly disturbing. I
was heartened when the country pulled together afterwards, then
dis&shy;ap&shy;point&shy;ed when it drifted back to business as usual.</p>
<p>Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, in honor of 9/11, I chose to apply for American
cit&shy;i&shy;zen&shy;ship. I hope to become a citizen within a year.</p>
<p>It was time for me to move past my fears and embrace America
whole&shy;heart&shy;ed&shy;ly. This is my home now. If there are things that I do not
like about it, then I must work harder to change them.</p>
<p>I’m proud of much that is good in America: its fine people, its
beautiful lands, its Con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion. I’m proud to be part of a country
that gives rise to leaders like Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln,
and Thomas Jefferson. America is the wellspring of modern democracy and
it continues to inspire the world.</p>
<p>Nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;iza&shy;tion was the right choice for me. I hope American cit&shy;i&shy;zen&shy;ship
is also the right choice for you.</p>

<p>I heard from the <span class="caps">INS</span> last week. My "initial interview" is scheduled for
late July.</p>
