<p>I have recently become involved with the upcoming local cel&shy;e&shy;bra&shy;tion of
Bloomsday, on June 16th. James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em> takes place on June 16th,
1904. In Seattle and elsewhere, fans of the book re-enact portions of the
book. In Dublin, Joyce has spawned a whole industry: ironic, when you
consider how little recog&shy;ni&shy;tion he received there during his lifetime. No
doubt, the Joycean industry will go into overdrive next year for the
centenary.</p>
<p>The Seattle group has been working its way through the book since 1998.
This year, we are reading Chapters 8 and 9, &quot;Lestry&shy;go&shy;ni&shy;ans&quot; and &quot;Scylla and
Charybdis&quot;. I had been vaguely aware that readings were held every year,
but I hadn't been to any of them. Two weeks ago, I saw on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishclub.org/resource.htm#4">Seattle Irish News</a>
mailing list that more readers were needed, so I decided to apply. I
am reading Dennis Breen, Dixon, the barman in Burton's restaurant, and Tom
Rochford in Chapter 8, and Mr. Best in Chapter 9. The reading will start at
8pm on June 16th, at the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.artsci.washington.edu/arts/Locations/Brechemin.asp">Brechemin Auditorium</a>
at the School of Music in the
University of Washington.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, &quot;Lestry&shy;go&shy;ni&shy;ans&quot;, describes Bloom's pere&shy;gri&shy;na&shy;tion through the
center of Dublin. He crosses the Liffey and heads south towards the
National Library. Much of the chapter is Bloom's stream of con&shy;scious&shy;ness,
as he observes people and places along the way. He runs into a few
ac&shy;quain&shy;tances and ends up in Davy Byrne's pub to eat lunch.</p>
<p>Chapter 9, &quot;Scylla and Charybdis&quot;, takes place in the National Library.
Bloom is briefly observed in the background, but doesn't say anything.
Stephen Dedalus, Joyce's young alter ego, is the subject of this chapter.
He holds forth in a long discussion of Shake&shy;speare and Hamlet. As usual,
he's witty, erudite, and not a little insecure.</p>
<p>As a Dubliner, you might expect that I have an affinity for the book. I
first attempted to read <em>Ulysses</em> in 1982, the centenary of Joyce's birth,
when I was 17. I gave up after a few chapters, finding it heavy going and
obscure. I've tried it again a few times since then, but have never got
more than a couple of hundred pages in to the book.</p>
<p>I'm trying once again. This time it's going better. No doubt, because I
have a motivation. But also, it makes more sense to me. I've learned two
tricks. The first is that if a section doesn't make sense, don't give up.
Keep going. It'll get more enjoyable. I don't think it all makes sense to
anyone on a first reading. The second is that the sounds are very
important. Joyce was a poet. Sub&shy;vo&shy;cal&shy;ize the odder bits and the music will
come through.</p>
<p>Someone once said that <em>Ulysses</em> is the most difficult of the en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing
books and the most en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing of the difficult books.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to the reading.</p>
