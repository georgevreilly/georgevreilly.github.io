<p>I have recently become involved with the upcoming local cel&shy;e&shy;bra&shy;tion of
Bloomsday, on June 16th. James Joyce&#8217;s <em>Ulysses</em> takes place on June 16th,
1904. In Seattle and elsewhere, fans of the book re-enact portions of the
book. In Dublin, Joyce has spawned a whole industry: ironic, when you
consider how little recog&shy;ni&shy;tion he received there during his lifetime. No
doubt, the Joycean industry will go into overdrive next year for the&nbsp;centenary.</p>
<p>The Seattle group has been working its way through the book since 1998.
This year, we are reading Chapters 8 and 9, &quot;Lestry&shy;go&shy;ni&shy;ans&quot; and &quot;Scylla and
Charybdis&quot;. I had been vaguely aware that readings were held every year,
but I hadn&#8217;t been to any of them. Two weeks ago, I saw on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishclub.org/resource.htm#4">Seattle Irish News</a>
mailing list that more readers were needed, so I decided to apply. I
am reading Dennis Breen, Dixon, the barman in Burton&#8217;s restaurant, and Tom
Rochford in Chapter 8, and Mr. Best in Chapter 9. The reading will start at
8pm on June 16th, at the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.artsci.washington.edu/arts/Locations/Brechemin.asp">Brechemin Auditorium</a>
at the School of Music in the
University of&nbsp;Washington.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, &quot;Lestry&shy;go&shy;ni&shy;ans&quot;, describes Bloom&#8217;s pere&shy;gri&shy;na&shy;tion through the
center of Dublin. He crosses the Liffey and heads south towards the
National Library. Much of the chapter is Bloom&#8217;s stream of con&shy;scious&shy;ness,
as he observes people and places along the way. He runs into a few
ac&shy;quain&shy;tances and ends up in Davy Byrne&#8217;s pub to eat&nbsp;lunch.</p>
<p>Chapter 9, &quot;Scylla and Charybdis&quot;, takes place in the National Library.
Bloom is briefly observed in the background, but doesn&#8217;t say anything.
Stephen Dedalus, Joyce&#8217;s young alter ego, is the subject of this chapter.
He holds forth in a long discussion of Shake&shy;speare and Hamlet. As usual,
he&#8217;s witty, erudite, and not a little&nbsp;insecure.</p>
<p>As a Dubliner, you might expect that I have an affinity for the book. I
first attempted to read <em>Ulysses</em> in 1982, the centenary of Joyce&#8217;s birth,
when I was 17. I gave up after a few chapters, finding it heavy going and
obscure. I&#8217;ve tried it again a few times since then, but have never got
more than a couple of hundred pages in to the&nbsp;book.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying once again. This time it&#8217;s going better. No doubt, because I
have a motivation. But also, it makes more sense to me. I&#8217;ve learned two
tricks. The first is that if a section doesn&#8217;t make sense, don&#8217;t give up.
Keep going. It&#8217;ll get more enjoyable. I don&#8217;t think it all makes sense to
anyone on a first reading. The second is that the sounds are very
important. Joyce was a poet. Sub&shy;vo&shy;cal&shy;ize the odder bits and the music will
come&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>Someone once said that <em>Ulysses</em> is the most difficult of the en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing
books and the most en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing of the difficult&nbsp;books.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the&nbsp;reading.</p>
