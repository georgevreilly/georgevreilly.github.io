<p>I detest George W. Bush and his ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion. The war, the economy, the
en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment, the judicial battles. I loathe just about everything that
comes out of the White House. I want that man <em>gone</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been following the Democratic pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial candidates with some
interest for the last few months. Right now, I feel like I&#8217;m a yellow dog
Democrat. I don&#8217;t care who wins in 2004, just so long as it&#8217;s a&nbsp;Democrat.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really true, however. I&#8217;d much rather have a candidate that I
have some enthusiasm for, rather than the lesser of two evils: such as Holy
Joe Lieberman or Bob Graham. It&#8217;s not enough to be against Bush; I have to
be <em>for</em> someone. Of the electable candidates, I like Howard Dean the&nbsp;best.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.deanforamerica.com/">Dean</a>
was the Governor of Vermont for nearly twelve years, winning
re-election five times. He positions himself as a social liberal and a
fiscal con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tive. He&#8217;s an <span class="caps">MD</span>, who managed to bring in health insurance
for almost child in Vermont. He also balanced the budget every year, and
signed the only civil unions bill in the nation, which almost gives
marriage to gay people. He has also attracted a fair amount of attention
for opposing the Iraq&nbsp;war.</p>
<p>I got to hear him when he spoke to the Microsoft Political Action Commitee
during his visit to Seattle a couple of weeks ago, and I found him to be
forthright, personable, and refreshing. He spoke off the cuff and he gave
reasoned responses to difficult questions. Compare that to Bush&#8217;s scripted
responses. For example, when asked about a report that he had felt
un&shy;com&shy;fort&shy;able about signing the civil unions bill in Vermont, he replied
that like most het&shy;ero&shy;sex&shy;u&shy;al male Americans, he wasn&#8217;t com&shy;fort&shy;able around
gay people, but he didn&#8217;t let that blind him to the injustice of the&nbsp;situation.</p>
<p>I just watched his appearance on the Charlie Rose show that I recorded on
the TiVo last week. Dean has built an
<a class="reference external" href="http://dean2004.meetup.com/">enormous following</a> on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://dean2004.blogspot.com/">Internet</a>,
and he&#8217;s appealing to a lot of people who&#8217;ve never been involved in
politics&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>Dean will be formally <a class="reference external" href="http://action.deanforamerica.com/meet/june23.html">declaring his candicacy on June 23rd</a>.</p>
