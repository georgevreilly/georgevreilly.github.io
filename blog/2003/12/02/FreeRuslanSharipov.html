<p>I sign a lot of petitions. Here&#8217;s one that I wrote a custom letter&nbsp;for.</p>
<p>First, the&nbsp;background.</p>

<strong><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">LIST</span> - Special Alert for Gay Torture&nbsp;Victim</strong></p>
<p>Washington, <span class="caps">DC</span>
December 1,&nbsp;2003</p>
<p>Ruslan Sharipov, a journalist in Uzbekistan, is being imprisoned and
tortured because he&#8217;s gay. His government captors have threatened to
rape him with a bottle and inject him with <span class="caps">AIDS</span>. But there is talk that
the government may soon amnesty a few political prisoners. Let&#8217;s make
sure he is one of them by emailing the 3 key <span class="caps">US</span> officials below,
demanding they tell the Uzbek government to free Ruslan&nbsp;Sharipov.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve managed to get the direct email addresses for these rather
high-ranking <span class="caps">US</span> officials. Let&#8217;s take advantage of our luck. And if
you&#8217;re not American, no matter - it&#8217;s still good for them to hear that
people around the world are watching America&#8217;s actions on this
important&nbsp;case:</p>

<p>You can read more about Ruslan&#8217;s case at the
<a class="reference external" href="http://thelist.c.tep1.com/maabIIBaa2zf3b4Ee9Wb/">Human Rights Watch Web site</a>.
<strong><span class="caps">BACKGROUND</span></strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, openly-gay journalist Ruslan Sharipov was given a
five-year prison term by the Uzbek government simply because he is an
openly-gay advocate for human rights in his Stalinist homeland. In the
six months he&#8217;s already been in prison, the 25-year-old Ruslan has been
physically and mentally tortured, and forced to write his own suicide
note. <strong><span class="caps">WHY</span> <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">EMAILS</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">MATTER</span></strong></p>
<p>This month, December 2003, the Uzbek government, under intense
in&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al pressure from groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty
In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al, is reportedly con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;ing freeing some of its 7,000 to
10,000 political prisoners. We need to make sure that Ruslan is among
those&nbsp;freed.</p>
<p>I have it on good authority that senior <span class="caps">US</span> officials do not believe the
American people care about Ruslan&#8217;s im&shy;pris&shy;on&shy;ment and torture. They
think we don&#8217;t care that the Bush Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion is giving Uzbekistan
$500 million a year in aid, much of it going towards training the very
state security apparatus that tortures gays and lesbians and other
political prisoners. And they think we don&#8217;t care that earlier this
year two political prisoners were boiled alive, and that our tax money
helps all of this happen. <strong><span class="caps">IT</span>&#8217;S <span class="caps">TIME</span> <span class="caps">TO</span> <span class="caps">TELL</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">US</span> <span class="caps">GOVERNMENT</span> <span class="caps">WE</span> <span class="caps">DO</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">CARE</span>.</strong></p>
<p>President Bush tells us he&#8217;s fighting for freedom and democracy in
Iraq, then supports a brutal dictator next door. President Bush needs
to start practicing what he preaches. He should tell the government of
Uzbekistan to free gay journalist Ruslan Sharipov. Again, those email

<p>Thanks so much, and please share this email alert with all of your
friends and colleagues. I truly believe that if we all get involved
now, this is one we can win in no time. (I&#8217;m doing this update as a
text-only version so you can easily forward it by email to your friends
and&nbsp;colleagues.)</p>

Subject: Free Ruslan&nbsp;Sharipov</p>
<p>The Bush Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion has taken to arguing that the <span class="caps">US</span> invaded Iraq
to save the Iraqi people from the brutality and torture of Saddam
Hussein&#8217;s regime, and to bring democracy. It&#8217;s un&shy;ques&shy;tion&shy;ably good that
the torturers of Iraq are&nbsp;gone.</p>
<p>But the Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion has also given $500 million to Uzbekistan, where
political prisoners have been boiled alive. Have we learned nothing
from the past? Saddam was once our puppet, as were many other dictators
in Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere. The <span class="caps">CIA</span> helped overthrow
Mossadegh&#8217;s de&shy;mo&shy;c&shy;ra&shy;t&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly elected government in Iran in 1953, to our
lasting cost. Supporting brutal dictators may help our strategic
position in the short term, but it makes us look like hypocrites. Can
we not do better than&nbsp;this?</p>
<p>I am par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly concerned about the plight of Ruslan Sharipov, the
gay journalist and human rights advocate who has been imprisoned in
Uzbekistan on trumped-up charges. I ask you to call upon the Uzbek
government to free Sharipov and other political&nbsp;prisoners.</p>

<p>May it do some&nbsp;good.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Ruslan was released and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sodomylaws.org/world/uzbekistan/uznews034.htm">granted asylum in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span></a>.</p>
