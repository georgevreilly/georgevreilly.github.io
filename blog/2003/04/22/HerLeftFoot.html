<p>I&#8217;ve been too busy in the last few weeks to post anything here. Mostly
because I&#8217;ve been busy with work. Partially because I&#8217;m too disgusted with
Iraq to say anything useful: Win the war and lose the peace.&nbsp;Feh!</p>
<p>In the last few days, I&#8217;ve been at home taking care of Emma. On Friday
morning, she had a Morton&#8217;s neuroma removed from her left foot. A nerve
running through the space between a couple of her toes had become enlarged
to about a centimeter in diameter, and it had been causing her a lot of
pain. She wasn&#8217;t able to stand or walk for more than 20 minutes without
discomfort, which rapidly grew worse the longer she stayed on her feet. It
first became a serious problem when we were in Ireland during Christmas
2001, when her foot gave out on Christmas Day. She was in great pain and
spent the rest of the vacation on&nbsp;crutches.</p>
<p>For the first week or so, she has to keep her foot elevated as much as
possible, and she&#8217;s under doctor&#8217;s orders not to put any weight on it. Even
if she were inclined to flout the orders, any time that she&#8217;s ac&shy;ci&shy;den&shy;tal&shy;ly
jolted it has been intensely painful. I&#8217;m staying home for a few days to
help nurse&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>After she goes back to work, I&#8217;m still going to have to look after her for
the next six-to-eight weeks. She&#8217;s supposed to minimize the amount of
walking or standing that she does, which means that she can&#8217;t wait for the
bus and she can&#8217;t drive, so I&#8217;ll have to bring her to and from work. I&#8217;ll
also have to bring her to physical therapy several times a&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s bearing up well, con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;ing the amount of pain that she&#8217;s been in
and the frus&shy;tra&shy;tion she feels at being able to do so little for herself. I
dislike seeing her in pain, so I&#8217;m looking forward to the time that she&#8217;ll
be able to walk com&shy;fort&shy;ably&nbsp;again.</p>
