<p>Emma got this list of &quot;why did the chicken cross the road?&quot; jokes off one
of her mailing lists. I&#8217;ve seen most of these before, but some are new, and
I can&#8217;t find this selection on&nbsp;Google.</p>

<div class="line">We don&#8217;t really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is either with us or it is against us. There is no middle ground here.</div>

<div class="line">The chicken&#8217;s habitat on the original side of the road had been polluted by unchecked in&shy;dus&shy;tri&shy;al&shy;ist greed. The chicken did not reach the unspoiled habitat on the other side of the road because it was crushed by the wheels of a gas-guzzling <span class="caps">SUV</span>.</div>

<div class="line">I don&#8217;t know why the chicken crossed the road, but I&#8217;ll bet it was getting a government grant to cross the road, and I&#8217;ll bet someone out there is already forming a support group to help chickens with crossing-the-road syndrome. Can you believe this? How much more of this can real Americans take? Chickens crossing the road paid for by their tax dollars, and when I say tax dollars, I&#8217;m talking about your money, money the government took from you to build roads for chickens to cross.</div>

<div class="line">Because the chicken was gay! Isn&#8217;t it obvious? Can&#8217;t you people see the plain truth in front of your face? The chicken was going to the other side. That&#8217;s what they call it &#8211; the other side. Yes, my friends, that chicken is gay. And, if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion that the liberal media white&shy;wash&shy;es with seemingly harmless phrases like the other side.</div>
