<p>Along with perhaps
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/antiwar/story/0,12809,897098,00.html">30 million others</a>,
Emma and I took part in a peace
rally on Saturday. We were delayed finishing up our signs, so we failed to
meet up with our friends before the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.feb15.org/">Seattle rally</a>,
although we did run into
another friend as the march set off.</p>
<p>There were an estimated <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/aplocal_story.asp?category=6420&amp;slug=WA%20Anti%20War%20Protests%20Wash">20,000 people</a>
at the Seattle rally, according to
the Seattle P-I. I would have thought more. It took eighty minutes from the
first marchers setting out to the last of the marchers getting a few blocks
away from the Seattle Center.</p>
<p>The night before the rally, I found a number of slogans on a mailing list,
and I turned 16 of them into signs (see the second of my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.george-reilly.com/sea-peace-feb15/index.html">photos</a>). We gave
most of them out to strangers before the rally. I marched with &quot;Don’t Waive
Your Rights while Waving Your Flag&quot;; Emma had &quot;Preemptive Im&shy;peach&shy;ment&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Contain Saddam -- and Bush</li>
<li>War begins with 'Dubya'</li>
<li>Who Would Jesus Bomb?</li>
<li>How did our oil get under their sand?</li>
<li>Sacrifice Our SUVs, not our Children</li>
<li>Preemptive Im&shy;peach&shy;ment</li>
<li>Our Grief over 9/11 is not a Cry for War</li>
<li>You don’t have to like Bush to love America</li>
<li>America, get out of the Bushes!</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm glad we went. It was good to feel some solidarity. It was especially
good to learn that so many others turned out at other rallies around the
world. We showed the world that not everyone in America is in lockstep
behind Bush.</p>
<p>Bush, however, remains unim&shy;pressed, at least in public. We can only hope
that it makes him pause even a little in private, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>My youngest brother, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.alienresident.net/">Mark</a>,
took part in the New York rally. He said that
the NYPD made it <a class="reference external" href="http://www.warblogging.com/archives/000501.php">impossible to get to the center of the rally</a>. My other
brother, David, and my sister, Michelle, took part in the rally in Dublin.</p>
