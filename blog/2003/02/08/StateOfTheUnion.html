<p>I didn't listen to Bush's State of the Union last week, because I was still
at work. Reading about it afterwards, I found it to be pre&shy;dictably
ob&shy;jec&shy;tion&shy;able.</p>
<p>I'm a Toast&shy;mas&shy;ter, so I found Salon's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/01/30/sotu_critique/index_np.html">&quot;Horrible&quot; speaker, great speech</a>
to be an in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing critique of the delivery and pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion.</p>
<p>The only parts of the speech that I did care for were the hydrogen car and
the promise to help prevent and treat AIDS in Africa.</p>
<p>Hydrogen cars would be a big im&shy;prove&shy;ment over gas-guzzling SUVs, but there
are a few problems. First, they're many years out and the Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion is
making no moves towards more fuel efficiency in the short-to-medium term. A
big part of the Iraq crisis is our dependence on foreign oil, but the
Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion is riddled with oil and energy industry veterans.</p>
<p>Secondly, hydrogen may be en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;men&shy;tal&shy;ly friendly to consume, but the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/weekinreview/02LIZZ.html">production of hydrogen can be en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;men&shy;tal&shy;ly harmful</a>. &quot;96 percent
of hydrogen produced in the world today comes from natural gas, oil and
coal -- the same fossil fuels that en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;men&shy;tal&shy;ists would like to
abandon.&quot;</p>
<p>AIDS is ravaging Africa. 90% of new cases of HIV infection occur there, 30
million are HIV+, and millions have already died. Many of the dead are
adults in the prime of their life, leaving behind orphans to be cared for
by the elderly. Generic versions of the AIDS an&shy;ti&shy;retro&shy;vi&shy;ral drugs, although
much cheaper than the first batch of drugs, are still beyond the reach of
most Africans. Not only is it the morally right thing to help Africa, but
it's a good for our security. Failed states breed terrorism.</p>
<p>Apparently this has been in the works for several months and I applaud the
Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion for this. Despite the Bush Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion's preference for
abstinence instead of safe sex, condoms are reported to be part of the
package. Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, much of the new money is coming out of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/000632.php">money used
to fight malaria and mal&shy;nu&shy;tri&shy;tion</a>.</p>
