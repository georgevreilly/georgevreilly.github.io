<p>&quot;The following was stolen from <span class="caps">JINX</span>: The World&#8217;s Weirdest eZine. Send
&#8216;Jinx me&#8217; to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:jinx@thecentre.com">jinx&#64;thecentre.com</a> for inclusion, sub&shy;scrip&shy;tion, and&nbsp;delight.&quot;</p>
<p>You know, many important the&shy;o&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal questions are answered if we think
of God as a Computer&nbsp;Programmer:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Does God control everything that happens in my&nbsp;life?</dt>
<dd>He could, if he used the debugger,
but it&#8217;s tedious to step through all those&nbsp;variables.</dd>
<dt>Why does God allow evil to&nbsp;happen?</dt>
<dd>God thought he eliminated evil in one of the earlier&nbsp;versions.</dd>
<dt>What causes God to intervene in earthly&nbsp;affairs?</dt>
<dd>If a critical error occurs, the system pages him au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly
and he logs on from home to try to bring it up.
Otherwise things can wait until&nbsp;tomorrow.</dd>
<dt>Did God really create the world in seven&nbsp;days?</dt>
<dd>He did it in six days and nights while living on
cola and candy bars. On the seventh day he went home
and found out his girlfriend had left him.
<em>or</em> on the 7th day the re&shy;quire&shy;ments were&nbsp;changed!</dd>
<dt>How come the Age of Miracles&nbsp;Ended?</dt>
<dd>That was the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment phase of the project,
now we are in the main&shy;te&shy;nance&nbsp;phase.</dd>
<dt>Who is&nbsp;Satan?</dt>
<dd>Satan is a <span class="caps">MIS</span> director who takes credit for more powers
than he actually possesses, so people who aren&#8217;t pro&shy;gram&shy;mers
are scared of him. God thinks of him as irritating but&nbsp;irrelevant.</dd>
<dt>What is the role of&nbsp;sinners?</dt>
<dd>Sinners are the people who find new and imag&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tive ways
to mess up the system when God has made it&nbsp;idiot-proof.</dd>
<dt>Where will I go after I&nbsp;die?</dt>
<dd>Onto a <span class="caps">DAT</span>&nbsp;tape.</dd>
<dt>Will I be&nbsp;rein&shy;car&shy;nat&shy;ed?</dt>
<dd>Not unless there is a special need to recreate you.
And searching those tar files is a major hassle,
so if there is a request for you,
God will just say that the tape has been&nbsp;lost.</dd>
<dt>Am I unique and special in the&nbsp;universe?</dt>
<dd>There are over 10,000 major university and corporate sites
running exact duplicates of you in the present release&nbsp;version.</dd>
<dt>What is the purpose of the&nbsp;universe?</dt>
<dd>God created it because he values elegance and simplicity,
but then the users and managers demanded he tack
all this senseless stuff onto it and now everything
is more com&shy;pli&shy;cat&shy;ed and expensive than&nbsp;ever.</dd>
<dt>If I pray to God, will he&nbsp;listen?</dt>
<dd>You can waste his time telling him what to do,
or you can just get off his back and let him&nbsp;program.</dd>
<dt>What is the one true&nbsp;religion?</dt>
<dd>All systems have their advantages and dis&shy;ad&shy;van&shy;tages,
so just pick the one that best suits your needs and
don&#8217;t let anyone put you&nbsp;down.</dd>
<dt>How can I protect myself from&nbsp;evil?</dt>
<dd>Change your password every month and don&#8217;t make it a name,
a common word, or a date like your&nbsp;birthday.</dd>
<dt>Some people claim they hear the voice of God. Is this&nbsp;true?</dt>
<dd>They are much more likely to receive&nbsp;email.</dd>
