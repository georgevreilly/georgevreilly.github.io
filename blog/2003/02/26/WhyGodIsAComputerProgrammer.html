<p>Taken from a mail to <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/">win_tech_of&shy;f_&shy;topic</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The following was stolen from JINX: The World's Weirdest eZine. Send
'Jinx me' to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:jinx@thecentre.com">jinx&#64;thecentre.com</a> for inclusion, sub&shy;scrip&shy;tion, and
delight.&quot;</p>
<p>You know, many important the&shy;o&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal questions are answered if we think
of God as a Computer Programmer:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Does God control everything that happens in my life?</dt>
<dd>He could, if he used the debugger,
but it's tedious to step through all those variables.</dd>
<dt>Why does God allow evil to happen?</dt>
<dd>God thought he eliminated evil in one of the earlier versions.</dd>
<dt>What causes God to intervene in earthly affairs?</dt>
<dd>If a critical error occurs, the system pages him au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly
and he logs on from home to try to bring it up.
Otherwise things can wait until tomorrow.</dd>
<dt>Did God really create the world in seven days?</dt>
<dd>He did it in six days and nights while living on
cola and candy bars. On the seventh day he went home
and found out his girlfriend had left him.
<em>or</em> on the 7th day the re&shy;quire&shy;ments were changed!</dd>
<dt>How come the Age of Miracles Ended?</dt>
<dd>That was the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment phase of the project,
now we are in the main&shy;te&shy;nance phase.</dd>
<dt>Who is Satan?</dt>
<dd>Satan is a MIS director who takes credit for more powers
than he actually possesses, so people who aren't pro&shy;gram&shy;mers
are scared of him. God thinks of him as irritating but irrelevant.</dd>
<dt>What is the role of sinners?</dt>
<dd>Sinners are the people who find new and imag&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tive ways
to mess up the system when God has made it idiot-proof.</dd>
<dt>Where will I go after I die?</dt>
<dd>Onto a DAT tape.</dd>
<dt>Will I be rein&shy;car&shy;nat&shy;ed?</dt>
<dd>Not unless there is a special need to recreate you.
And searching those tar files is a major hassle,
so if there is a request for you,
God will just say that the tape has been lost.</dd>
<dt>Am I unique and special in the universe?</dt>
<dd>There are over 10,000 major university and corporate sites
running exact duplicates of you in the present release version.</dd>
<dt>What is the purpose of the universe?</dt>
<dd>God created it because he values elegance and simplicity,
but then the users and managers demanded he tack
all this senseless stuff onto it and now everything
is more com&shy;pli&shy;cat&shy;ed and expensive than ever.</dd>
<dt>If I pray to God, will he listen?</dt>
<dd>You can waste his time telling him what to do,
or you can just get off his back and let him program.</dd>
<dt>What is the one true religion?</dt>
<dd>All systems have their advantages and dis&shy;ad&shy;van&shy;tages,
so just pick the one that best suits your needs and
don't let anyone put you down.</dd>
<dt>How can I protect myself from evil?</dt>
<dd>Change your password every month and don't make it a name,
a common word, or a date like your birthday.</dd>
<dt>Some people claim they hear the voice of God. Is this true?</dt>
<dd>They are much more likely to receive email.</dd>
