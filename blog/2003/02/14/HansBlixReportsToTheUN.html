<p>Hans Blix presented his latest report to the <span class="caps">UN</span> this morning. No surprises.
Saddam is not being par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly co&shy;op&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tive, there are some &quot;proscribed&quot;
missiles, but they&#8217;ve found no evidence that Iraq is hiding prohibited
weapons. All the players held fast to their&nbsp;positions.</p>
<p>Colin Powell hammered home the point that if Saddam had nothing to hide,
the Iraqi scientists would be lining up to be in&shy;ter&shy;viewed by <span class="caps">UN</span> inspectors.
True, but that&#8217;s still not a <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2003/02/10/CasusBelliII.html">case for going to war</a>.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s New York Times, a new <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/14/politics/14POLL.html?th">poll shows most want war delay</a>. 59% of
Americans favor giving the inspectors more time and 56% want Bush to wait
for <span class="caps">UN</span> approval. Three-quarters see war as inevitable, and two-thirds
approve of war as an&nbsp;option.</p>
<p>I think the war is inevitable. Bush won&#8217;t back down and Saddam is unlikely
to. In&shy;spec&shy;tions are containing Iraq, and I see no need to attack. About the
only thing that would change my mind is clear, un&shy;equiv&shy;o&shy;cal proof that
Saddam was behind the September 11th attacks. So far, that proof has
cir&shy;cum&shy;stan&shy;tial, frag&shy;men&shy;tary, and un&shy;con&shy;vinc&shy;ing. Tuesday&#8217;s tape from Osama
bin Laden showed that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/14/opinion/14FRI1.html">Al-Qaida has little liking for Saddam</a>.</p>
<p>The Bush Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/14/opinion/14KRIS.html">seems more interested in using nukes in Iraq</a> than
it is in planning how to maintain a long occupation. We liberated
Afghanistan from the Taliban and broke up the Al-Qaida training grounds,
but we&#8217;ve not seen it through. Afghanistan is a mess, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav020603.shtml">opium trade is
flour&shy;ish&shy;ing again</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/000652.php">was omitted from the <span class="caps">US</span> aid budget</a>! An attack on
Iraq will further inflame dis&shy;em&shy;pow&shy;ered young Muslims who, rightly, complain
that too little is being done by the <span class="caps">US</span> to make peace between the Israelis
and the Pales&shy;tini&shy;ans. Much of the world thinks that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/14/opinion/14LEVI.html">Al-Qaida is a bigger
threat than Saddam</a>.
Others believe that Bush is a bigger threat to world
peace than Saddam: certainly the Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion&#8217;s
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/000654.php">alliance wrecking in <span class="caps">NATO</span></a>
and the <span class="caps">UN</span> tends to supports that. (It&#8217;s hard to believe how quickly Bush
managed to dissipate the good will that poured out to America after 9/11.)
And the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hillnews.com/marshall/021203.aspx">crisis in North Korea</a>,
which is being handled so dif&shy;fer&shy;ent&shy;ly, is
perhaps most worrying of&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">US</span> economy is in a shambles, with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/14/opinion/14KRUG.html">deficits soaring</a>.
The War on Terrorism is going nowhere. The Department of Homeland Security is raising
public anxiety by going to Threat Level Orange, but can offer nothing
better than suggesting that we seal off windows with plastic sheeting and
duct tape. Ashcroft is cooking up a <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2003/02/14/PatriotActII.html">draconian sequel to the Patriot Act</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I intend to go to the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2003/02/15/SeattlePeaceRallySat15thFebSeattleCenter.html">Seattle Peace March and Rally</a> tomorrow.
It&#8217;s important to demon&shy;strate to Bush, the <span class="caps">US</span> public, and the world that a
lot of Americans oppose Bush&#8217;s&nbsp;war&shy;mon&shy;ger&shy;ing.</p>
