<p>I have received hundreds of copies of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.potifos.com/fraud/">Nigerian scam spam</a> in the last couple of years. Nigerian
criminals, typically claiming to be relatives of rich-but-deceased African
potentates, ask for &quot;help&quot; in getting assets out of Africa. You are asked
to pony up some money to defray expenses, in return for a cut of the
proceeds.</p>
<p>Someone has put together a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.politechbot.com/p-04372.html">Bush-Iraq parody</a> of these letters. George Walker
Bush, son of the former President of the USA, seeks your help in acquiring
oil funds that are trapped in Iraq...</p>

<p>IMMEDIATE ATTENTION NEEDED
: HIGHLY CON&shy;FI&shy;DEN&shy;TIAL</p>
<p>FROM: GEORGE WALKER BUSH
DEAR SIR / MADAM,</p>
<p>I AM GEORGE WALKER BUSH, SON OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH, AND CURRENTLY SERVING AS PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THIS LETTER MIGHT SURPRISE YOU BECAUSE WE HAVE
NOT MET NEITHER IN PERSON NOR BY COR&shy;RE&shy;SPON&shy;DENCE. I CAME TO KNOW OF YOU IN MY
SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE AND REPUTABLE PERSON TO HANDLE A VERY CON&shy;FI&shy;DEN&shy;TIAL
BUSINESS TRANS&shy;AC&shy;TION, WHICH INVOLVES THE TRANSFER OF A HUGE SUM OF MONEY TO
AN ACCOUNT REQUIRING MAXIMUM CONFIDENCE.</p>
<p>I AM WRITING YOU IN ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE PRIMARILY TO SEEK YOUR ASSISTANCE IN
ACQUIRING OIL FUNDS THAT ARE PRESENTLY TRAPPED IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ. MY
PARTNERS AND I SOLICIT YOUR ASSISTANCE IN COMPLETING A TRANS&shy;AC&shy;TION BEGUN BY
MY FATHER, WHO HAS LONG BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM
IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND BRAVELY SERVED HIS COUNTRY AS DIRECTOR
OF THE UNITED STATES CENTRAL IN&shy;TEL&shy;LI&shy;GENCE AGENCY.</p>
<p>IN THE DECADE OF THE NINETEEN-EIGHTIES, MY FATHER, THEN VICE-PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, SOUGHT TO WORK WITH THE GOOD OFFICES OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ TO REGAIN LOST OIL REVENUE SOURCES IN THE
NEIGH&shy;BOR&shy;ING ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN. THIS UN&shy;SUC&shy;CESS&shy;FUL VENTURE WAS SOON
FOLLOWED BY A FALLING OUT WITH HIS IRAQI PARTNER, WHO SOUGHT TO ACQUIRE
ADDITIONAL OIL REVENUE SOURCES IN THE NEIGH&shy;BOR&shy;ING EMIRATE OF KUWAIT, A
WHOLLY-OWNED U.S.-BRITISH SUBSIDIARY.</p>
<p>MY FATHER RE-SECURED THE PETROLEUM ASSETS OF KUWAIT IN 1991 AT A COST OF
SIXTY-ONE BILLION U.S. DOLLARS ($61,000,000,000). OUT OF THAT COST,
THIRTY-SIX BILLION DOLLARS ($36,000,000,000) WERE SUPPLIED BY HIS PARTNERS
IN THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER PERSIAN GULF MONARCHIES, AND
SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ($16,000,000,000) BY GERMAN AND JAPANESE PARTNERS.
BUT MY FATHER'S FORMER IRAQI BUSINESS PARTNER REMAINED IN CONTROL OF THE
REPUBLIC OF IRAQ AND ITS PETROLEUM RESERVES.</p>
<p>MY FAMILY IS CALLING FOR YOUR URGENT ASSISTANCE IN FUNDING THE REMOVAL OF
THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ AND ACQUIRING THE PETROLEUM ASSETS OF
HIS COUNTRY, AS COM&shy;PEN&shy;SA&shy;TION FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVING HIM FROM POWER.
UN&shy;FOR&shy;TU&shy;NATE&shy;LY, OUR PARTNERS FROM 1991 ARE NOT WILLING TO SHOULDER THE BURDEN
OF THIS NEW VENTURE, WHICH IN ITS UPCOMING PHASE MAY COST THE SUM OF 100
BILLION TO 200 BILLION DOLLARS ($100,000,000,000 - $200,000,000,000), BOTH
IN THE INITIAL AC&shy;QUI&shy;SI&shy;TION AND IN LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT.</p>
<p>WITHOUT THE FUNDS FROM OUR 1991 PARTNERS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE
THE OIL REVENUE TRAPPED WITHIN IRAQ. THAT IS WHY MY FAMILY AND OUR
COLLEAGUES ARE URGENTLY SEEKING YOUR GRACIOUS ASSISTANCE. OUR DIS&shy;TIN&shy;GUISHED
COLLEAGUES IN THIS BUSINESS TRANS&shy;AC&shy;TION INCLUDE THE SITTING VICE-PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RICHARD CHENEY, WHO IS AN ORIGINAL PARTNER
IN THE IRAQ VENTURE AND FORMER HEAD OF THE HAL&shy;LIBUR&shy;TON OIL COMPANY, AND
CONDOLEEZA RICE, WHOSE PRO&shy;FES&shy;SION&shy;AL DEDICATION TO THE VENTURE WAS
DEMON&shy;STRAT&shy;ED IN THE NAMING OF A CHEVRON OIL TANKER AFTER HER.</p>
<p>I WOULD BESEECH YOU TO TRANSFER A SUM EQUALING TEN TO TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT
(10-25 %) OF YOUR YEARLY INCOME TO OUR ACCOUNT TO AID IN THIS IMPORTANT
VENTURE. THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL
FUNCTION AS OUR TRUSTED IN&shy;TER&shy;ME&shy;DI&shy;ARY. I PROPOSE THAT YOU MAKE THIS TRANSFER
BEFORE THE FIFTEENTH (15TH) OF THE MONTH OF APRIL.</p>
<p>I KNOW THAT A TRANS&shy;AC&shy;TION OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD MAKE ANYONE AP&shy;PRE&shy;HEN&shy;SIVE
AND WORRIED. BUT I AM ASSURING YOU THAT ALL WILL BE WELL AT THE END OF THE
DAY. A BOLD STEP TAKEN SHALL NOT BE REGRETTED, I ASSURE YOU. PLEASE DO BE
INFORMED THAT THIS BUSINESS TRANS&shy;AC&shy;TION IS 100% LEGAL. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO
CO-OPERATE IN THIS TRANS&shy;AC&shy;TION, PLEASE CONTACT OUR IN&shy;TER&shy;ME&shy;DI&shy;ARY
REP&shy;RE&shy;SEN&shy;TA&shy;TIVES TO FURTHER DISCUSS THE MATTER.</p>
<p>I PRAY THAT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR PLIGHT. MY FAMILY AND OUR COLLEAGUES WILL BE
FOREVER GRATEFUL. PLEASE REPLY IN STRICT CONFIDENCE TO THE CONTACT NUMBERS
BELOW.</p>
<p>SINCERELY WITH WARM REGARDS,</p>
<p>GEORGE WALKER BUSH</p>
