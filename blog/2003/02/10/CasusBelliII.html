<p>Colin Powell went to the <span class="caps">UN</span> and made a case that Saddam has not disarmed
and that he continues to act in defiance of the <span class="caps">UN</span>. Not too surprising,
since that&#8217;s what Blix has said. If Saddam had nothing to hide, he would
have cooperated with the <span class="caps">UNMOVIC</span>&nbsp;inspectors.</p>
<p>What Powell did not show is why Saddam&#8217;s defiance warrants going to&nbsp;war.</p>
<p>Some doubt the veracity of Powell&#8217;s case, citing the ease of forging
evidence. This is the same ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion that gave us the
<a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1843201.stm">Pentagon&#8217;s Office of Strategic In&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion aka the
dis&shy;in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion unit</a>.
I&#8217;ll give them the benefit of the doubt. They have to know that if a war is
launched and sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant quantities of weapons of mass de&shy;struc&shy;tion are not
found in Iraq, that Bush will be out on his&nbsp;ear.</p>
<p>Joe Conasaon reviewed Colin Powell&#8217;s <span class="caps">UN</span> speech in Wednesday&#8217;s Salon and
concludes that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/conason/2003/02/05/bush/">the case for war has not been made</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
What was most noticeably absent from Powell&#8217;s pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion, however,
was any evidence that Iraq is a present threat to its neighbors or any
other nation &#8211; and thus must be invaded and subdued im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly. He
showed that Saddam has sought an arsenal of mass de&shy;struc&shy;tion, and that
his regime is still resisting dis&shy;ar&shy;ma&shy;ment. But he in&shy;ad&shy;ver&shy;tent&shy;ly made
some arguments for continued in&shy;spec&shy;tions backed by force, rather than
war.</blockquote>
<p>Nicholas Kristof comes to a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/07/opinion/07KRIS.html">similar conclusion</a>
in yesterday&#8217;s&nbsp;<span class="caps">NYT</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hawks often compare Saddam to Hitler, suggesting that if we don&#8217;t stand
up to him today in Baghdad we&#8217;ll face him tomorrow in the
Mediter&shy;ranean.&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<p>A better analogy is Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, who used to be
denounced as the Hitler of the 1980&#8217;s.&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<p>But President Ronald Reagan wisely chose to contain Libya, not invade
it &#8211; and this worked. Does anybody think we would be better off today
if we had invaded Libya and occupied it, spending the last two decades
with our troops being shot at by Bedouins in the&nbsp;desert?</p>
