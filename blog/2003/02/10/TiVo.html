<p>Emma bought herself a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tivo.com/1.0.asp">TiVo Digital Video Recorder</a>
a few weeks ago. I had heard it said
that TiVo changes the way you watch <span class="caps">TV</span>. It&#8217;s true. Emma is fond of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hgtv.com/">Home and Garden Television (<span class="caps">HGTV</span>)</a>,
which has a lot of shows about re&shy;dec&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ing and re&shy;mod&shy;el&shy;ling. They&#8217;re padded
un&shy;mer&shy;ci&shy;ful&shy;ly, constantly recapping what they showed you before the most
recent break. She can work through an ostensible 30-minute show in under 10
minutes by skipping from highlight to&nbsp;highlight.</p>
<p>Our TiVo also has a DirecTV satellite receiver built in, giving us access
to far more stations than we had on cable, with better quality picture. We
also bought a new 27&quot; <span class="caps">TV</span> to replace the 21&quot; <span class="caps">TV</span> that I bought secondhand in
1993. The com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion of a digital signal and a new <span class="caps">TV</span> gives us a far
better image than we&#8217;re used to &#8211; though it&#8217;s not half bad on the old <span class="caps">TV</span>
either. Alas,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_law">Sturgeon&#8217;s Law</a>
(Ninety percent of everything is [crud]), still applies to the&nbsp;content.</p>
<p>The sheer con&shy;ve&shy;nience of being able to tell it to record a slew of shows,
without having to mess around with lots of videotapes, means that we&#8217;re
able to watch a number of programs that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise watch. I&#8217;ve
started watching the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.charlierose.com/">Charlie Rose Show</a>
again, for the first time in years. It airs from midnight to 1am in
Seattle. I&#8217;m a night owl, but that was too in&shy;con&shy;ve&shy;nient for me. &quot;Time
shifting&quot; makes it much more likely that I&#8217;ll watch&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been much of a <span class="caps">TV</span> watcher, but I&#8217;m seeing more than I have in
years. I&#8217;ve also taken to watching <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/multimedia/tv/">Cirque du Soleil: Fire Within</a>,
a doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary series about the making of the Cirque&#8217;s new show Varekai, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sho.com/ptbs/">Penn <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Teller: Bullshit!</a>, a series debunking
alien abductions, psychics, and&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also recording a lot of films that we might not have got around to
renting or seeing in the cinema. Our main problem is that the hard disk
only holds about 35 hours of content. That sounds like a lot, but it fills
up&nbsp;quickly.</p>
