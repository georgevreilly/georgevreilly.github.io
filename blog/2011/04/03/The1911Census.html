    <p>It&#8217;s the 100th an&shy;niver&shy;sary of the 1911 census of the United Kingdom,
which was taken on the night of Sunday, April 2nd.
Ireland was still part of the <span class="caps">UK</span> and hence was included in the&nbsp;census.</p>
<p>The census results are online.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_of_Ireland,_1911">Irish results</a> are freely browsable.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.1911census.co.uk/"><span class="caps">UK</span> results</a> cost&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>Three of my grand&shy;par&shy;ents were born in the 18 months following the&nbsp;census.</p>
<p><strong>George&nbsp;Clery</strong></p>
<p>My maternal grand&shy;fa&shy;ther, George Victor Clery, was born on March 30th, 1900.
He died on March 3rd, 1965, twelve days before I was born.
I am called George after him and Vincent after my&nbsp;father.</p>
<p>Gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tions of Clerys worked for the Munster <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Leinster bank,
which became Allied Irish Bank in the late&nbsp;1960s.</p>

<p><strong>Ethna&nbsp;MacDonagh</strong></p>
<p>My mother&#8217;s mother, Ethna MacDonagh, was born on April 28th, 1911.
Her parents had moved from Ireland to London a few years earlier.
Her father Francis was a journalist and died, I think, when she was a young woman.
Her mother Hannah died when I was 8.
Hannah was one of the first women to graduate from an Irish&nbsp;university.</p>

<p><strong>Patrick&nbsp;Reilly</strong></p>
<p>Patrick “Paddy” Reilly was born on June 3rd, 1911,
to a well-to-do farmer, near Kells, Co. Meath.
He was one of 10 children; nine survived.
The last brother, Richard “Dick” O&#8217;Reilly, lives near&nbsp;Vancouver.</p>
<p>Paddy studied medicine at Trinity College Dublin but never finished.
He spent most of his career selling tyres for&nbsp;Goodyear.</p>

<p><strong>Kathleen&nbsp;Taylor</strong></p>
<p>My father&#8217;s mother, Kathleen Taylor, was born on August 1st, 1912.
Her father was later a supplier to the Irish Dept of Defence, I believe.
“Gam”, as we called her, was always secretive about her age
and would be horrified that I&#8217;ve told you.
She dyed her hair black until the day she died, six years&nbsp;ago.</p>
