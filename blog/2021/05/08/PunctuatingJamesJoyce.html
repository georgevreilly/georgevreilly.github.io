<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://lithub.com/the-punctuation-marks-loved-and-hated-by-famous-writers/">The Punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion Marks Loved (and Hated) by Famous Writers</a>,
Emily Temple relays a range of opinions from writers
such as Tom Wolfe, Elmore Leonard, and Ursula K. Le Guin
on periods, semicolons, hyphens and&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;commas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Listens to the sound of the sentence, and is always right, Bob: Toni&nbsp;Morrison</p>
<blockquote>
[On her editor, Bob Gottlieb, who famously
“was always inserting commas into Morrison’s sentences
and she was always taking them out”]
We read the same way.
We think the same way.
He is over&shy;whelm&shy;ing&shy;ly aggressive about commas and all sorts of things.
He does not understand that commas are for pauses and breath.
He thinks commas are for gram&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal things.
We have come to an un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing, but it is still a fight.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>On&nbsp;periods:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tolerates it, if he must: Cormac&nbsp;McCarthy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe in periods, in capitals, in the occasional comma, and that’s&nbsp;it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>James Joyce is a good model for punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion.
He keeps it to an absolute minimum.
There’s no reason to blot the page up with weird little marks.
I mean, if you write properly you shouldn’t have to&nbsp;punctuate.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>My own prose tends towards longer sentences,
often sprinkled with dashes, paren&shy;the&shy;ses, and&nbsp;semicolons.</p>
<p>Since 2004, I&#8217;ve adapted all of James Joyce&#8217;s <em>Ulysses</em> for staged readings
by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/">Wild Geese Players of Seattle</a>,
and I&#8217;m in the Morrison camp, not the Mc&shy;Carthy–Joyce&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>Paragraphs like these work on the printed page.
(More or&nbsp;less.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tear is bloody near your eye.
Talking through his bloody hat.
Fitter for him go home to the little sleep&shy;walk&shy;ing bitch he married,
Mooney, the bumbailiff&#8217;s daughter,
mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street,
that used to be stravaging about the landings
Bantam Lyons told me
that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her,
exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no&nbsp;favour.</p>
<p class="attribution">&mdash;Anonymous narrator, Episode 12, “Cyclops”,&nbsp;L400</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Martin Cunningham forgot to give us his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jjon.org/joyce-s-allusions/spellingbee-conundrum">spelling&shy;bee conundrum</a> this morning.
It is amusing to view the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it?
double ess ment of a harassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y

Silly, isn&#8217;t it? Cemetery put in of course on account of the&nbsp;symmetry.</p>
<p class="attribution">&mdash;Mr Bloom, Episode 7, “Aeolus”,&nbsp;L170</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But imagine trying to read those sentences <em>aloud</em> during a per&shy;for&shy;mance
and bring the sense of the text to the&nbsp;audience.</p>
<p>As an aide to my performers,
I&#8217;ve introduced “cadence bars” (denoted by ‘≀’) to the scripts
to augment Joyce&#8217;s sparse punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion
and to bring out the individual&nbsp;fragments.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve also added some pseudo-hyphens
(bum·bailiff, spelling·bee, what·&shy;do·y&shy;ou·&shy;cal&shy;l·him)
to counteract Joyce&#8217;s Germanic habit of stringing several words into&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>This seems to help,
though some of our readers have to fight a tendency to pause too much
when they encounter a ‘≀’&nbsp;symbol.</p>
