<p>I&#8217;ve read hundreds of technical books over the last 40 years.
<em>Crafting In&shy;ter&shy;preters</em> is an instant classic,
and far more readable and fun than many of the&nbsp;classics.</p>
<p>Nystrom covers a lot of ground in this book,
building two very different in&shy;ter&shy;preters for Lox,
a small dynamic language of his own design.
He takes us through <em>every line</em> of
jlox, a Java-based tree-walk in&shy;ter&shy;preter,
and of clox, a bytecode virtual machine written in&nbsp;C.</p>
<p>For the first im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion, jlox,
he covers such topics as scanning,
parsing ex&shy;pres&shy;sions with recursive descent,
evaluating ex&shy;pres&shy;sions, control flow,
functions and closures, classes, and&nbsp;in&shy;her&shy;i&shy;tance.</p>
<p>Starting with an empty slate,
Nystrom adds just enough code to implement the topic
of each chapter,
having a working albeit incomplete im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion of the in&shy;ter&shy;preter
by the end of the chapter.
He adds new code as he goes,
inserting an extra <tt class="docutils literal">case</tt> into a <tt class="docutils literal">switch</tt> here
or writing a new function there,
or replacing a few lines of an earlier im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion
with something that&#8217;s just been explained.
Knuth&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Literate Pro&shy;gram&shy;ming</a> explains a finished im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion,
broken into separate pieces for exposition.
Nystrom&#8217;s continual, ever-evolving exposition is slower to get to the point,
but it&#8217;s excellent pedagogy.
I would be remiss if I didn&#8217;t mention the hundreds of hand-drawn il&shy;lus&shy;tra&shy;tions,
which add a quirky flavor to the tone of the book.
He has a blog post on how he <a class="reference external" href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2020/04/05/crafting-crafting-interpreters/">pulled this or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tion off</a>
and another on how he created a <a class="reference external" href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2021/07/29/640-pages-in-15-months/">physical book</a> from the&nbsp;text.</p>
<p>clox is a very different second im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion of a Lox in&shy;ter&shy;preter.
Instead of a slow in&shy;ter&shy;preter walking an abstract syntax tree,
he develops a stack-based virtual machine,
compiles Lox into bytecode,
and interprets the bytecode.
He covers theory and practical con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tions
for creating a bytecode virtual machine,
makes use of Pratt’s “top-down operator precedence parsing”,
and implements closures and classes in C.
In jlox, he used Java&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal">HashMap</tt> to manage iden&shy;ti&shy;fiers
and relied on Java&#8217;s garbage collection for memory management.
For clox, he implements a hash table and a mark-and-sweep garbage collector.
Although he has to cover similar topics (parsing, local variables, closures) each time,
he finds a fresh per&shy;spec&shy;tive for the second&nbsp;im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion.</p>
<p>I read the entire book for free at <a class="reference external" href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">https://crafting&shy;in&shy;ter&shy;preters.com/</a>,
but I liked it so much that I&#8217;ve ordered a physical copy.
In fact, I actually read much of the book on the website in 2020,
but life intervened and I didn&#8217;t finish it,
so this month, I read it again from the&nbsp;start.</p>
<p>This book is not a textbook and you don&#8217;t get an exhaustive in&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;tion
to building in&shy;ter&shy;preters, much less compilers.
In the final year of my Computer Science degree at Trinity College Dublin in 1986–87,
I studied the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools">Dragon Book</a> when the first edition was brand new.
<em>Crafting In&shy;ter&shy;preters</em> is a lot more fun than the Dragon&nbsp;Book.</p>
<p>Highly&nbsp;rec&shy;om&shy;mend&shy;ed!</p>
