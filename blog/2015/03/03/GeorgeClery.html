<p>It's the fiftieth an&shy;niver&shy;sary of the death of my maternal grand&shy;fa&shy;ther,
George Victor Clery, on 3rd March 1965.
It did not come as a shock to the family.
His health was often poor and he had been ill for some time.
He was born a month premature on 30th March 1900
and his mother was told she would never rear him.
Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, he grew up to become an avid golfer and tennis player,
to marry and father five children,
and to live all the way to a brief retirement,
though not quite long enough to see any of his grand&shy;chil&shy;dren.
Both I and my cousin Siobh√°n were born in the six weeks after his death.
We must have been a welcome dis&shy;trac&shy;tion for his grieving widow and children.</p>

<p>George joined the family trade of retail banking
and spent his entire career at the Munster &amp; Leinster bank.
Once he became a bank manager, he got to live &quot;above the shop&quot;, in the bankhouse.
My mother spent her entire childhood in two Dublin bankhouses,
many years in the working-class suburb of Inchicore,
followed by a few years in middle-class Rathgar.</p>
<p>George had an older brother, Dick, who was always something of a prig.
One day when they were both children,
Dick snapped at George, &quot;Don't contradict me!&quot;,
to which George replied, &quot;Don't con&shy;tra&shy;george me!&quot;.</p>
<p>George met Ethna MacDonagh when she was visiting cousins in Ireland.
She had grown up in London, born there of Irish parents.
They had a quick courtship and a quiet wedding in 1936, as one of her sisters had just died.
Four children followed promptly, Joan, Dick, Ethna (my mother), and Georgina,
with Gabriel born in 1949.</p>

<p>His word was law in his household, but my mother adored him.
He was very sociable:
he'd invite clients to lunch in the bankhouse at the drop of a hat
and my grand&shy;moth&shy;er would have to figure out to feed them.
He'd stay up late with his cronies, playing poker.</p>
<p>My own parents courted for more than six years,
saving to buy a house,
and George and Ethna Sr became friendly with Paddy and Kathleen Reilly.
One day, George was ill in bed with a bad case of diarrhoea
and Paddy arrives with a present.
George unwraps it and finds an enormous cork to stop the flow, which he found quite amusing.</p>
<p>My parents married on George's 64th birthday, 30th March 1964.
Alas, he did not live to celebrate their first wedding an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
My mother was nine months pregnant with me when he died.
Despite the stress, I was born two weeks late, on 15th March.
I was to have been named Vincent, after my father;
instead I was christened George Vincent.</p>
<p>I got to know my other three grand&shy;par&shy;ents well, as they all lived until I was an adult,
but I regret that I had never had a chance to meet George Victor Clery.</p>
