<p>Blogging has been on my mind lately,
as I&#8217;ve just set up an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.metabrite.com/devblog/">en&shy;gi&shy;neer&shy;ing blog</a> at&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>I gave a speech about blogging earlier tonight
to my club, <a class="reference external" href="http://freelyspeaking.org/">Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters</a>.
I no longer write speeches be&shy;fore&shy;hand;
I ex&shy;tem&shy;po&shy;rized my speech from a
<a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/01/09/MindMappingSpeech.html">mindmap</a>
that I had prepared yesterday.
This post is a more coherent and expanded rendition of my&nbsp;points.</p>
<p>As Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters, we give speeches about topics that interest us,
when we want to share or inform or entertain.
A live, in-person speech reaches a direct audience at one point in time.
A written blog post can reach a much larger audience.
Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters have something to say, whether in person or in&nbsp;print.</p>
<p>A blog can be a personal soapbox, allowing us to talk to people around the world.
Not so many years ago, the best that most of us could hope for would be to send out
a badly mimeo&shy;graphed newsletter at in&shy;ter&shy;mit&shy;tent intervals.
The select few might have a newspaper column or have written some books.
Little dialog was possible with the&nbsp;audience.</p>
<p>A blog allows us to build personal or pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al brands.
A blog lets us air our political views,
show off our knowledge,
teach some hard-won skill,
expound upon our insights,
inspire others,
share stories about our family,
fight for a cause,
build an audience for our business,
chat about our hobbies,
talk about our travels,
journal our lives—or many other&nbsp;purposes.</p>
<p>Writing a blog forces us to <em>write</em>,
to clarify our thinking,
and to craft our words.
It imposes discipline upon us,
especially if we post regularly.
Writing is com&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;tary to&nbsp;speaking.</p>
<p>Writing can help us build an audience and a network.
A blog can serve as a&nbsp;résumé.</p>
<p>A few bloggers—a very few—make sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant income from blogging,
though most seem to be little better than multilevel marketing.
&quot;Pay $39.95 for my book on blogging secrets!&quot;,
where the secret is to sell books on blogging for&nbsp;$39.95.</p>
<p>Some writers,
like <a class="reference external" href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/">John Scalzi</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/">Charlie Stross</a>,
not content with writing best-selling books,
also write popular blogs with sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ties.
These blogs un&shy;doubt&shy;ed&shy;ly help sell their authors&#8217; books,
but they also provide another outlet for their&nbsp;thoughts.</p>
<p>I contribute to three blogs:
my <a class="reference external" href="/blog/">personal blog</a> (this one),
where I write about whatever strikes my fancy:
politics, technology, book reviews, pho&shy;tog&shy;ra&shy;phy, travel, etc;
my <a class="reference external" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/george_v_reilly">technical blog</a>;
and the new <a class="reference external" href="http://www.metabrite.com/devblog/">en&shy;gi&shy;neer&shy;ing blog</a> at work.
I also set up <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.cozi.com/tech/">another en&shy;gi&shy;neer&shy;ing blog</a> at my previous job.
The en&shy;gi&shy;neer&shy;ing blogs provide a forum for the en&shy;gi&shy;neer&shy;ing teams
to talk about technology,
to give back by sharing knowledge,
to hone writing skills,
to improve the writers&#8217; personal brands,
and to tacitly recruit other&nbsp;engineers.</p>
<p>Find something you want to write about—be it your travels, your business, your cancer,
your favorite <span class="caps">TV</span> show, your hob&shy;bies—and start writing.
Keep a notebook and jot down potential topics as they come to you.
(I give the same advice about making&nbsp;speeches.)</p>
<p>To get started on your own blog,
try out one of the free services,
like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>,
or <a class="reference external" href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>.
Choose a theme that reflects your style and per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ty.
Write a few&nbsp;posts.</p>
<p>If you like blogging,
register your own domain name,
like georgevreil&shy;ly.com or joeys&shy;jaun&shy;tyjin&shy;gles.net.
This will give you more presence.
If you ever decide to move to a different blogging platform,
migration will be simpler if neither the domain nor the blog post links change.
Consider paying someone to host your&nbsp;blog.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t paralyze yourself over&shy;think&shy;ing the blog.
Get started and write&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>Everybody has something to say, both in speech and in&nbsp;writing.</p>
