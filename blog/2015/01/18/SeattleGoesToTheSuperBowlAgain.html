    <p>I sat in a deserted coffee shop this afternoon with Emma,
as much of Seattle was watching the playoff game
of the Seattle Seahawks against the Green Bay Packers.
Idly curious, I checked the score early in the fourth quarter
and found that the Packers were leading 19–7.
I was quite surprised later to find that the Seahawks had won 28–22,
sending themselves to the Super Bowl in Arizona in two weeks' time.
Apparently, it was a thrilling comeback late in the game.</p>
<p>I suppose that I'm happy for my football-loving friends,
though I'm inclined to “love the sinner but hate the sin”,
as I can't stand football.
I spent eleven years (ages 7–18) at a rugby-playing school in Dublin,
where I came away with an abiding dislike of that game and the jock culture.
American football, if anything, is worse:
a brutal, punishing sport with obnoxious fans.</p>
<p>We're thinking of having a non-Super Bowl Super Bowl party—a football-free party held at the same time.</p>
