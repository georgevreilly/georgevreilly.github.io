        </h1>

    <p>When I buy a book, I want to be able to read it how and where I like,
not where the bookseller dictates.
With printed books, the very idea of the bookseller having any say is ridiculous.
The book is now my property, to read where and how I like,
to give away or to lend or even to sell.
I've bought thousands of new books and thousands more secondhand books from bookstores.</p>
<p>Most electronic books are crippled with DRM.
DRM stands for <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">Digital Rights Management</a>,
although <a class="reference external" href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/">Defective By Design</a> prefers to expand DRM
as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management">Digital Re&shy;stric&shy;tions Management</a>.
DRM is technology that controls digital content <em>after</em> it has been sold.
In particular, DRM'd ebooks sold at Amazon are encrypted
and can only be read on Kindle devices and apps.
Similarly, DRM'd ebooks from Barnes &amp; Noble are restricted to Nook devices and apps.</p>
<p>Some publishers sell DRM-free ebooks at Amazon and B&amp;N,
but they're in a small minority.
When I buy technical books, I try to buy directly from the publishers,
who will often bundle both the ebook and the pbook editions together
for a fraction of their separate costs.</p>
<p>Having paid for an ebook, I want to read it on whatever computer or device is at hand,
regardless of where I bought it.
I can do that if I remove the DRM encryption.
Tools exist to help with that,
such as Apprentice Alf's <a class="reference external" href="https://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/drm-removal-tools-for-ebooks/">DRM Removal Tools for eBooks</a>.
The plugin for <a class="reference external" href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> works very well.
I convert ebooks to unlocked EPUBs,
which I can then read on my eInk reader,
or with the <a class="reference external" href="http://readium.org/">Readium</a> browser extension in Chrome,
or the <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/epubreader/">EPUBReader</a> browser extension for Firefox,
or the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.canoejoy.com/clearview/">Clearview</a> app on my Macâ€”or in the original seller's app.
It's my choice.</p>
