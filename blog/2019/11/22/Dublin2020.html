<p>I left in the Eighties; I&#8217;m going back in the&nbsp;Twenties.</p>
<p>I am trans&shy;fer&shy;ring to a Dublin-based team at <a class="reference external" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> for a one-year rotation.
Emma and I will be moving to Dublin just before Christmas.
Emma has never lived in Ireland
and I haven&#8217;t lived there since January 1989.
After 30 years in the <span class="caps">US</span>, I&#8217;m about to spend a year in my&nbsp;hometown.</p>
<p>I grew up in Dublin,
earned a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Computer Science at Trinity College Dublin in 1987,
and moved to the <span class="caps">US</span> in 1989
to get a Master&#8217;s degree in Comp Sci at Brown University in Providence, <span class="caps">RI</span>.
Microsoft moved me to Seattle, <span class="caps">WA</span> in 1992,
where I&#8217;ve lived ever since.
Between 1992 and 2005,
I worked at Microsoft three times
for a total of ten years.
I joined Stripe in Seattle in mid-2018,
after eleven years at two startups,
Cozi and&nbsp;Cookbrite/MetaBrite.</p>
<p>Emma and I met in 1997,
and married and bought a house in 2000.
We are now fran&shy;ti&shy;cal&shy;ly trying to get that house into shape
to rent out during our year&#8217;s absence.
We&#8217;ve been working all-out for several weeks
and now there&#8217;s only four weeks to go.
She carried the burden by herself last week,
as I spent the week in Dublin, meeting my new team.
I had done so much painting of interior rooms
before I went to Dublin two weeks ago,
that the fin&shy;ger&shy;print readers on my laptop and phones
were rejecting my fin&shy;ger&shy;print.
My fin&shy;ger&shy;print works again,
but there&#8217;s still a little painting to be&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited and nervous.
It&#8217;s not easy to pick up and move after spending decades in one city.
We have plenty of storage in our Seattle house
and had little im&shy;pe&shy;tus—un&shy;til now—to shed stuff.
And there&#8217;s lots and lots of stuff.
Thousands upon thousands of books,
the im&shy;ped&shy;i&shy;men&shy;ta of various hobbies,
and twenty years of odds and ends.
We&#8217;ve purged a lot but the end is not yet in sight.
I&#8217;ll be spending the second week of December in the San Jose and San Francisco,
so I&#8217;ll need to spend Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing working on the&nbsp;house.</p>
<p>Stripe has been great in providing relocation assistance to us,
providing services in both Seattle and Dublin.
I lined up an apartment in Dublin the day before I returned.
We&#8217;ll be living at the top of a Georgian house on Adelaide Road.
It&#8217;s not too small, but it&#8217;ll feel cramped compared to our Seattle&nbsp;house.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I moved from an in&shy;fra&shy;struc&shy;ture team in the Stripe Seattle office
to a new security team (Anti-Abuse) in the Stripe Dublin office.
Not only is the team new, all of the team members are new to Stripe:
most joined in August and the longest-tenured joined in March.
They&#8217;ve already ac&shy;com&shy;plished quite a bit,
but they&#8217;ve left a few things for me to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>My family are excited too.
I have two siblings living in Ireland,
but they&#8217;re both over two hours&#8217; drive
from my parents&#8217; home in Dublin.
My sister&#8217;s in rural Cork and one of my brothers is in rural Mayo.
We&#8217;re all going down to Cork for a few days at&nbsp;Christmas.</p>
<p>Ireland, here we&nbsp;come!</p>
