<p>I woke up on Saturday to read on Bram Moolenaar&#8217;s Facebook page
an <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/bram.moolenaar/posts/pfbid0d7rBdoVZu7Ww2yvmpEjmjJ1B3WYVFf86nFrFXczmRcYzjUxChq3xcjH84zURsZYjl">an&shy;nounce&shy;ment</a> of his death.
I knew Bram online for nearly 30 years and
I was one of his relatively small number of Facebook friends,
but we never met in real life.
I knew that he had retired from Google Zurich to Tenerife,
but I hadn&#8217;t been aware that he had been&nbsp;ill.</p>
<p>Bram was known to the world for his signature creation,
the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vim.org">Vim text editor</a>,
used by millions of developers on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
Vim stands for Vi IMproved,
but it outgrew the original <tt class="docutils literal">vi</tt> long&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p>I was an <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/12/30/20YearsOfVi.html">active con&shy;trib&shy;u&shy;tor</a> to Vim in the 1990s:
I wrote a lot of the Win32 console mode code
as well as the alpha version of Windows gVim;
my name is at the top of the <a class="reference external" href="https://vimhelp.org/os_win32.txt.html">page</a> if you do <tt class="docutils literal">:help win32</tt>.
In the 00s, I ported Vim to Win64.
I drifted away from active par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pa&shy;tion more than a decade ago,
but I still lurk on the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/g/vim_dev/">vim_dev</a> mailing&nbsp;list.</p>
<p>Vim has been the thoroughly dominant flavor of <tt class="docutils literal">vi</tt>
for a number of years,
but that wasn’t the case in the 90s.
There were Elvis, vile, xvi, and other things I no longer recall.
Bram built a better <tt class="docutils literal">vi</tt>
and he built a solid community of developers and users.
I never saw the toxic behavior that’s prevalent in some tech com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ties.
Bram was always a patient and reasonable leader.
He poured countless hours into making Vim an ever better editor
and he answered so many questions on the various mailing lists.
Vim would not have succeeded half so well without the community that he built.
I didn’t always agree with Bram&#8217;s technical decisions
(and neither did the NeoVim people),
but I have enormous respect for what he ac&shy;com&shy;plished,
tech&shy;ni&shy;cal&shy;ly and&nbsp;socially.</p>
<p>The other remarkable thing about Vim is that it’s <a class="reference external" href="https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/uganda.html#license">char&shy;i&shy;ty&shy;ware</a>.
Vim users were strongly encouraged to donate to <a class="reference external" href="https://iccf-holland.org/"><span class="caps">ICCF</span> Holland</a>,
which supports children in Kibaale, Uganda.
Bram was the treasurer of <span class="caps">ICCF</span> and was involved with the work for many years.
When I was at Microsoft,
I got a bunch of Vim-loving engineers to donate;
Microsoft matched our donations.
I made another donation to <span class="caps">ICCF</span> today in his&nbsp;memory.</p>
<p>It’s clear that work on Vim will continue.
Although Bram was the benevolent dictator for life of Vim,
a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/orgs/vim/people">handful of others</a> have commit rights
and are planning <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/g/vim_dev/c/dq9Wu5jqVTw/m/puYIETTwAAAJ">future of the Vim project</a>.
They have big shoes to fill.
I don’t know enough about <span class="caps">ICCF</span> to say how severely this will affect&nbsp;them.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ETA</span></strong>: The upcoming Vim 9.1 release will be <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/12749">dedicated to Bram</a>,
just as the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/g/vim_announce/c/MJBKVd-xrEE/m/joVNaDgAAgAJ">9.0 release was dedicated to Sven Guckes</a>, who died last year.
Sven was one of Vim&#8217;s greatest am&shy;bas&shy;sadors,
endlessly helpful to users in the newsgroups.
We stayed for a week with Sven in August 2014 in his Berlin apartment,
and he was the most wonderful host,
spending many hours showing us around his beloved&nbsp;city.</p>
