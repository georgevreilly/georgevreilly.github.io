<p>George W. Bush, after months of hinting that he would support the Federal
Marriage Amendment, has endorsed it. He&#8217;s desparate&shy;ly trying to change the
subject from whether he was <span class="caps">AWOL</span> from the National Guard in&nbsp;Alabama.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Campaign is urging everyone to oppose this. They provide a
sample letter to send to your rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives, but I threw it away and
wrote my own (below), which has been sent to my rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives, via the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hrcactioncenter.org/campaign/bush_fma"><span class="caps">HRC</span> Action Center</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bush Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion pisses me off on so many levels. I&#8217;m
par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly infuriated about Bush&#8217;s support for the Federal Marriage
Amendment. After hinting that he&#8217;d support it for the last few months,
he&#8217;s now trying to change the subject from the charges that he was <span class="caps">AWOL</span>
from the Air National&nbsp;Guard.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">FMA</span> is a rabble-rousing exercise cooked up by the likes to Donald
Wildmon to invigorate the religious right. Once again, the know-nothing
bible thumpers are demonizing gay people. I&#8217;m sick of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Specious arguments about the sanctity of marriage fall flat when you
consider that 50% of marriages end in divorce and Britney Spear&#8217;s
frivolous prank has more legal standing than a gay couple that have
been together for&nbsp;decades.</p>
<p>The federal government has no business in&shy;ter&shy;fer&shy;ing in marriage. That&#8217;s
the states&#8217;&nbsp;pre&shy;rog&shy;a&shy;tive.</p>
<p>Several com&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tors have argued that not only would the <span class="caps">FMA</span> forbid gay
marriage, it would also void any civil unions leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;tion that some
states may&nbsp;pass.</p>
<p>We should be following the example of most Western European nations and
decoupling the civil and religious aspects of marriage. The state and
only the state can marry you. A religious wedding has no legal
sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cance. I don&#8217;t expect this to happen in the <span class="caps">US</span> anytime soon. So
much for the Separation of Church and&nbsp;State.</p>
<p>I fully expect you to vigorously oppose the&nbsp;<span class="caps">FMA</span>.</p>
<p>I would very much like for you to support gay marriage, or at least
civil&nbsp;unions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives are Rep. Jim McDermott, Sen. Patty Murray, and Sen.
Maria Cantwell, Jim McDermott is very liberal and needs no urging to oppose
it; Cantwell and Murray are fairly liberal, but it does no harm to stiffen
their spines. Or for me to&nbsp;vent.</p>
