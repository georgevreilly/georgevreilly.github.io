<p>George W. Bush, after months of hinting that he would support the Federal
Marriage Amendment, has endorsed it. He's desparate&shy;ly trying to change the
subject from whether he was AWOL from the National Guard in Alabama.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Campaign is urging everyone to oppose this. They provide a
sample letter to send to your rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives, but I threw it away and
wrote my own (below), which has been sent to my rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives, via the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hrcactioncenter.org/campaign/bush_fma">HRC Action Center</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bush Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion pisses me off on so many levels. I'm
par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly infuriated about Bush's support for the Federal Marriage
Amendment. After hinting that he'd support it for the last few months,
he's now trying to change the subject from the charges that he was AWOL
from the Air National Guard.</p>
<p>The FMA is a rabble-rousing exercise cooked up by the likes to Donald
Wildmon to invigorate the religious right. Once again, the know-nothing
bible thumpers are demonizing gay people. I'm sick of it.</p>
<p>Specious arguments about the sanctity of marriage fall flat when you
consider that 50% of marriages end in divorce and Britney Spear's
frivolous prank has more legal standing than a gay couple that have
been together for decades.</p>
<p>The federal government has no business in&shy;ter&shy;fer&shy;ing in marriage. That's
the states' pre&shy;rog&shy;a&shy;tive.</p>
<p>Several com&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tors have argued that not only would the FMA forbid gay
marriage, it would also void any civil unions leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;tion that some
states may pass.</p>
<p>We should be following the example of most Western European nations and
decoupling the civil and religious aspects of marriage. The state and
only the state can marry you. A religious wedding has no legal
sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cance. I don't expect this to happen in the US anytime soon. So
much for the Separation of Church and State.</p>
<p>I fully expect you to vigorously oppose the FMA.</p>
<p>I would very much like for you to support gay marriage, or at least
civil unions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives are Rep. Jim McDermott, Sen. Patty Murray, and Sen.
Maria Cantwell, Jim McDermott is very liberal and needs no urging to oppose
it; Cantwell and Murray are fairly liberal, but it does no harm to stiffen
their spines. Or for me to vent.</p>
