<p>From my email. Origin&nbsp;obscure.</p>
<p>Things you have to believe to be a Republican&nbsp;today:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you&#8217;re a con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tive radio host. Then it&#8217;s an illness and you need our prayers for your&nbsp;recovery.</li>
<li>The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing <span class="caps">U.N.</span> res&shy;o&shy;lu&shy;tions against&nbsp;Iraq.</li>
<li>&quot;Standing Tall for America&quot; means firing your workers and moving their jobs to&nbsp;India.</li>
<li>A woman can&#8217;t be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national cor&shy;po&shy;ra&shy;tions can make decisions affecting all mankind without&nbsp;regulation.</li>
<li>Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of ho&shy;mo&shy;sex&shy;u&shy;als and Hillary&nbsp;Clinton.</li>
<li>The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans&#8217; benefits and combat&nbsp;pay.</li>
<li>Group sex and drug use are degenerate sins unless you someday run for governor of California as a&nbsp;Republican.</li>
<li>If condoms are kept out of schools, ado&shy;les&shy;cents won&#8217;t have&nbsp;sex.</li>
<li>A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies then demand their co&shy;op&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion and&nbsp;money.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="10">
<li>HMOs and insurance companies have the interest of the public at heart. Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is&nbsp;socialism.</li>
<li>Global warming and tobacco&#8217;s link to cancer are junk science, but cre&shy;ation&shy;ism should be taught in&nbsp;schools.</li>
<li>Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush&#8217;s daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him, and a bad guy when Bush needed a &quot;we can&#8217;t find Bin Laden&quot;&nbsp;diversion.</li>
<li>The public has a right to know about Hillary&#8217;s cattle trades, but George W. Bush&#8217;s driving record is none of our&nbsp;business.</li>
<li>You support states&#8217; rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter ini&shy;tia&shy;tives they have a right to&nbsp;adopt.</li>
<li>Government should relax regulation of Big Business and Big Money but crack down on in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;als who use marijuana to relieve the pain of&nbsp;illness.</li>
<li>What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what <span class="caps">G.W.</span> Bush did in the &#8216;80s is&nbsp;irrelevant.</li>
<li>Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of in&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al&nbsp;harmony.</li>
</ol>
