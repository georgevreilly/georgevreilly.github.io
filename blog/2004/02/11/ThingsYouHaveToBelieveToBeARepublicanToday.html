<p>From my email. Origin obscure.</p>
<p>Things you have to believe to be a Republican today:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tive radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery.</li>
<li>The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. res&shy;o&shy;lu&shy;tions against Iraq.</li>
<li>&quot;Standing Tall for America&quot; means firing your workers and moving their jobs to India.</li>
<li>A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national cor&shy;po&shy;ra&shy;tions can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.</li>
<li>Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of ho&shy;mo&shy;sex&shy;u&shy;als and Hillary Clinton.</li>
<li>The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.</li>
<li>Group sex and drug use are degenerate sins unless you someday run for governor of California as a Republican.</li>
<li>If condoms are kept out of schools, ado&shy;les&shy;cents won't have sex.</li>
<li>A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies then demand their co&shy;op&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion and money.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="10">
<li>HMOs and insurance companies have the interest of the public at heart. Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.</li>
<li>Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but cre&shy;ation&shy;ism should be taught in schools.</li>
<li>Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him, and a bad guy when Bush needed a &quot;we can't find Bin Laden&quot; diversion.</li>
<li>The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George W. Bush's driving record is none of our business.</li>
<li>You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter ini&shy;tia&shy;tives they have a right to adopt.</li>
<li>Government should relax regulation of Big Business and Big Money but crack down on in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;als who use marijuana to relieve the pain of illness.</li>
<li>What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what G.W. Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.</li>
<li>Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of in&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al harmony.</li>
</ol>
