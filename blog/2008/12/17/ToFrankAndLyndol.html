<p>My friends Frank and Lyndol met 32 years ago today,
the day they celebrate as their an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
For several years, Emma and I have brought them out for dinner on this date.
We also celebrate Lyn&#8217;s birthday,
which falls next&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>Frank&#8217;s health has been poor for some years,
but it&#8217;s grown worse this year.
He spent six weeks in hospital in September and October.
He&#8217;s home now, but he&#8217;s in <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.motss/browse_thread/thread/38e9223106252317">hospice care</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, we try to see him often,
since he rarely feels strong enough to leave the house,
even in a wheelchair.
We almost always find him in good form,
glad to see us and ready with his&nbsp;stories.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s somewhat stronger than when he left hospital.
They&#8217;ve been provided with a hospital bed as part of the hospice care,
but he&#8217;s still sleeping in his own bed while he&nbsp;can.</p>
<p>We had hoped to take them to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.szmanias.com/">Szmania&#8217;s</a> in Magnolia for dinner tonight.
It didn&#8217;t work out as planned, alas.
Lyndol showed up alone:
Frank had felt too weak to come.
In truth, he was also worried about the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2008/12/15/IcyRoads.html">icy roads</a>
and getting&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>The three of us ate dinner together.
The pheasant was par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly good.
It was a fine meal, but not the same without&nbsp;Frank.</p>
<p>We brought the dessert back to their house,
surprising Frank who was very happy to see&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>I would wish them many more years together,
but it&#8217;s not to&nbsp;be.</p>
