<p>When I was a boy, anytime we said ‘Dundrum’ (a suburb of Dublin),
it was with a snigger, because it was synonymous in our minds
with the <a class="reference external" href="http://wikimapia.org/72462/Central-Mental-Hospital-Dundrum">mental asylum</a> located there.
Nowadays, Dundrum is much better known as the home of a large
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dundrum.ie/">shopping centre</a>.
I’m so out of touch with Dublin that I hadn’t realized
that there was a major new shopping centre there.
I assumed that people were talking about the unim&shy;pres&shy;sive
little centre that I remembered there from my childhood.
Until today, when we went there to return the
mobile phone that we had given my mother for Christmas.</p>
<p>Dundrum was, indeed, a madhouse.
There’s much talk of a recession in Ireland,
as in the United States,
but there was little evidence of it in Dundrum today.
The Centre was op&shy;pres&shy;sive&shy;ly full: heat, noise, jostling crowds.</p>
<p>My mother wanted a new mobile phone for Christmas.
Her only re&shy;quire&shy;ments were that it have a camera,
that it be easy to use, and the buttons easy to read.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.carphonewarehouse.ie/blog/2008/06/30/samsung-tocco/">Samsung Tocco</a> has a nice-looking touch screen and
David and I thought it would be just the thing,
based on our brief experiment with one the other day.</p>
<p>Not so. My mother was totally flummoxed by it.
David and I found it confusing and irritating too.
The scroll works opposite to the way I expected from the iPhone.
Texting was horrible:
instead of an alphabetic keypad on the touch&shy;screen,
it showed the ten digits with three letters on each digit—just like a
tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al mobile phone.
And the <span class="caps">UI</span> locked you into a nasty series of modal dialogs
that were not easy to work with.
I probably would have returned it had I bought it for myself,
and it was in&shy;sup&shy;port&shy;able for my mother.</p>
