<p>Emma had a chance to play with Jacob&#8217;s Kindle (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA">Amazon</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle">Wikipedia</a>) today,
while I looked&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>The electronic paper screen is one of the big selling points.
We found the text to be very readable, albeit black-and-white.
It works very well for its primary use case—dis&shy;play&shy;ing
book pages with minimal battery drain—but it&#8217;s sluggish when updating&nbsp;menus.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not impressed by the design of the case.
The buttons on the side are far too big;
the keyboard at the bottom is ridiculous.
It would be in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing to see what Apple could&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexcycle_Stanza">Stanza</a> on my iPhone for the last couple of months,
mostly to read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.feedbooks.com/book/228">Ac&shy;celeran&shy;do</a> on the bus.
I like it, though the screen is so small that I&#8217;m flipping
pages every few&nbsp;seconds.</p>
<p>The thought of holding several months&#8217; worth of reading
on one device is very tempting,
especially as we&#8217;re off to Dublin for two weeks.
Physical books are heavy and they&#8217;re bulky.
We&#8217;ll bring a number of books with us
and come back with even&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>I read a lot online, but I prefer to read printed books.
I am more likely to get lost in a book.
Online, I am more likely to drift.
Books have heft and tactile feedback.
Good books are physically beautiful.
The typography and layout contribute to
a plea&shy;sur&shy;able reading&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>Flipping through a book is not the same as scrolling through an e-book.
There are sub&shy;con&shy;scious cues that allow spatial navigation to be very fast
in printed material.
Orienting myself in an ebook is harder.
Annotating and high&shy;light&shy;ing online material is difficult.
I like to have a high&shy;lighter marker in hand
when reading technical books.
On the other hand, you can&#8217;t grep dead&nbsp;trees.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m deeply skeptical of DRMed content
and reluctant to buy content that I can&#8217;t transfer to
other devices of my choosing.
I know that if I take reasonable care of a book,
I will still be able to read it in thirty years&#8217; time.
I am less confident of e-books in pro&shy;pri&shy;etary&nbsp;formats.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s ridiculous that e-books cost as much as printed books.
There are real costs associated with printing
and dis&shy;trib&shy;ut&shy;ing printed books.
Publishers can make higher margins off e-books
than they do from printed books
and still sell them for&nbsp;less.</p>
<p>Emma is more en&shy;thu&shy;si&shy;as&shy;tic about e-book readers than I am.
It seems inevitable that we&#8217;ll buy one,
but not just&nbsp;yet.</p>
