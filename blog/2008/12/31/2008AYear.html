<p>2008 closes, leaving economic wreckage in its wake.
Personally and pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly, it's been a good year.
At the national level, it's been both a very good year and a disastrous one.
Obama's historic victory is offset by the imploding economy.</p>
<p>My health remains good, I'm a little fitter than I was a year ago.
I've notched up a few personal milestones,
such as receiving my Competent Com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tor award at Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters and
becoming the secretary of Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters.</p>
<p>My friends and family are, mostly, doing well.
My sister is (still!) on the verge of having her first child.
Emma's health is never great:
she will have surgery to remove abdominal adhesions in a few weeks.
And Frank is in slow decline.</p>
<p>I like my job at Cozi.
I've learned a lot in the last year and
I've seen our products improve enormously since the beginning of the year.
I think we're well placed to ride out the downturn.</p>
<p>That downturn worries me.
The economy was unsound and badly needs re&shy;struc&shy;tur&shy;ing,
but a lot of people are going to get hurt
before it can be fixed.</p>
<p>I still have high hopes for Obama.
I wonder how much he can achieve in that initial honeymoon.
He certainly can't fix everything that's broken.</p>
<p>2009? We live in in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing times.</p>
