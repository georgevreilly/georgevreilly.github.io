<p>Yesterday, I said that it seemed like the economy was one giant Ponzi&nbsp;scheme.</p>
<p>Via Eric, Michael Lewis&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/11/11/The-End-of-Wall-Streets-Boom">The End of Wall Street&#8217;s&nbsp;Boom</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Whit&shy;ney’s] message was clear. If you want to know what these Wall
Street firms are really worth, take a hard look at the crappy assets
they bought with huge sums of borrowed money, and imagine what they’d
fetch in a fire sale. The vast as&shy;sem&shy;blages of highly paid people inside
the firms were es&shy;sen&shy;tial&shy;ly worth nothing. For better than a year now,
Whitney has responded to the claims by bankers and brokers that they
had put their problems behind them with this write-down or that capital
raise with a claim of her own: You’re wrong. You’re still not facing up
to how badly you have mismanaged your&nbsp;business.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>By the spring of 2005, FrontPoint was fairly convinced that something
was very screwed up not merely in a handful of companies but in the
financial un&shy;der&shy;pin&shy;nings of the entire <span class="caps">U.S.</span> mortgage market. In 2000,
there had been $130 billion in subprime mortgage lending, with $55
billion of that repackaged as mortgage bonds. But in 2005, there was
$625 billion in subprime mortgage loans, $507 billion of which found
its way into mortgage&nbsp;bonds.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The funny thing, looking back on it, is how long it took for even
someone who predicted the disaster to grasp its root causes. They were
learning about this on the fly, shorting the bonds and then trying to
figure out what they had done. Eisman knew subprime lenders could be
scumbags. What he un&shy;der&shy;es&shy;ti&shy;mat&shy;ed was the total unabashed complicity of
the upper class of American capitalism. For instance, he knew that the
big Wall Street investment banks took huge piles of loans that in and
of themselves might be rated <span class="caps">BBB</span>, threw them into a trust, carved the
trust into tranches, and wound up with 60 percent of the new total
being rated&nbsp;<span class="caps">AAA</span>.</p>
<p>But he couldn’t figure out exactly how the rating agencies justified
turning <span class="caps">BBB</span> loans into <span class="caps">AAA</span>-rated bonds. “I didn’t understand how they
were turning all this garbage into gold,” he says. He brought some of
the bond people from Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, and <span class="caps">UBS</span> over for a
visit. “We always asked the same question,” says Eisman. “Where are the
rating agencies in all of this? And I’d always get the same reaction.
It was a smirk.” He called Standard <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Poor’s and asked what would
happen to default rates if real estate prices fell. The man at S&amp;P
couldn’t say; its model for home prices had no ability to accept a
negative number. “They were just assuming home prices would keep going
up,” Eisman&nbsp;says.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“You have to understand this,” he says. “This was the engine of doom.”
Then he draws a picture of several towers of debt. The first tower is
made of the original subprime loans that had been piled together. At
the top of this tower is the <span class="caps">AAA</span> tranche, just below it the <span class="caps">AA</span> tranche,
and so on down to the riskiest, the <span class="caps">BBB</span> tranche—the bonds Eisman had
shorted. But Wall Street had used these <span class="caps">BBB</span> tranch&shy;es—the worst of the
worst—to build yet another tower of bonds: a “par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly egregious”
<span class="caps">C.D.O.</span> The reason they did this was that the rating agencies, presented
with the pile of bonds backed by dubious loans, would pronounce most of
them <span class="caps">AAA</span>. These bonds could then be sold to in&shy;vestors—pen&shy;sion funds,
insurance com&shy;pa&shy;nies—who were allowed to invest only in highly rated
securities. “I cannot fucking believe this is allowed—I must have said
that a thousand times in the past two years,” Eisman&nbsp;says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sordid tale of moral bankruptcy.
