<p>David Postman says that State Senator Eric Oemig is
once again <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/davidpostman/2008/01/lawmaker_pushes_again_for_impeachment_of_president.html">pushing for im&shy;peach&shy;ment</a> in the Washington State Leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;ture.
Washington for Im&shy;peach&shy;ment has the text of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonforimpeachment.org/blog/index.php?entry=entry080113-212558">SJM 8016</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the comment that I posted under Postman's article.
It's based upon a speech that I gave at Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters last year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've had enough.
I'm sick of the lies.
I'm tired of the scandals.
I'm angry at the loss of civil liberties.</p>
<p>Scandals like the US Attorneys' firings,
the Walter Reed out&shy;pa&shy;tients,
the Katrina debacle.
Pardoning Scooter Libby, who outed an undercover CIA agent.
Voter sup&shy;pres&shy;sion.
The War on Science.
Theocracy.
Corruption.
The War on the En&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment.
Food safety.
Toy safety.
The Pat Tillman coverup.
Terri Schiavo.
700+ signing statements.</p>
<p>The lies.
Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Powell lied to the Congress,
the American people, and the world,
when they told us there were weapons of mass de&shy;struc&shy;tion in Iraq.
There were no ties between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda.
Thousands of American troops are dead,
tens of thousands are maimed,
and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis are dead.
Now they're trying to instigate a war on Iran.</p>
<p>Do you miss your civil liberties?
The PATRIOT Act is an Orwellian nightmare.
What about the &quot;quaint&quot; Geneva Con&shy;ven&shy;tions?
Ex&shy;tra&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nary rendition, torture, and the loss of habeas corpus.
Illegal wire&shy;tap&shy;ping of US citizens.</p>
<p>Where is the outrage?
It's been a slow-motion coup for the last seven years.</p>
<p>We can't fire Bush.
We can't try him in court.
We can't have a recall election
or a vote of no confidence.</p>
<p>We should impeach him for these crimes:
lying us into Iraq;
torturing prisoners;
and illegally wire&shy;tap&shy;ping US citizens.</p>
<p>Yes, it will be ugly.
But if we continue to leave him in office,
we become complicit.
We already failed one test in the 2004 election.
Im&shy;peach&shy;ment will restore US moral authority.
Leaving him in office sends the wrong message.</p>
<p>Military personnel and office holders take
an oath to support and defend the Con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion.</p>
<p>We can defend the Con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion by Impeaching this President.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the sooner, the better.</p>
