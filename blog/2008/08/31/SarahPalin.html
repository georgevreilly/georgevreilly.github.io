<p>After months of attacking Obama's “in&shy;ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence”,
McCain has picked an unknown first-term governor from a minor state
with an un&shy;der&shy;whelm&shy;ing resume.</p>
<p>What gross ir&shy;re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty!
A seventy-two-year-old with a history of skin cancer,
who feels the need to keep his medical records under a tight wrap,
should have a running mate who's ready to
take over at any time.
When you compare her to Biden or Obama,
Palin clearly isn't.
I sincerely believe that I'm better informed about the world than she is,
based on reports of her lack of interest in Iraq until recently,
and that she didn't have a passport until 2007.</p>
<p>What she does bring to the ticket is hard-right,
cre&shy;ation&shy;ist, evan&shy;gel&shy;i&shy;cal cred&shy;i&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty.
(<a class="reference external" href="http://pol.moveon.org/emails/palin_announcement.html?rc=homepage">MoveOn</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2008/08/maverick-mom-by-digby-im-back-now.html">Digby</a> have more.)</p>
<p>The other thing that she brings is her looks.
Most people's very first impression of her
is going to be some variant of &quot;Wow! She's hot!&quot;
Sur&shy;pris&shy;ing&shy;ly <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">|---|</span></a> or perhaps not <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">|---|</span></a> almost all of the
serious political commentary that I've read over the
last couple of days has avoided mentioning this.</p>
<p>Some people will un&shy;doubt&shy;ed&shy;ly vote for McCain now
because there's an attractive woman on the ticket.
Others will re&shy;flex&shy;ive&shy;ly dismiss her as a Barbie doll
because of her looks.
I think it'll both help and hurt McCain.
Help, because sex sells.
Hurt, because her fresh face will remind voters how old McCain is.</p>
<p>Personally, I'd much rather vote for Michael Palin,
but he's not running — or eligible.
I'm sticking with Obama.</p>
