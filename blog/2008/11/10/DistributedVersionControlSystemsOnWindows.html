<p>At work, I&#8217;ve been ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ment&shy;ing with the big three
Dis&shy;trib&shy;uted Version Control Systems,
<a class="reference external" href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a>,
on Windows over the last ten&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>Pavel and Eric have been singing the praises of Git and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html">git-svn</a> on their Mac and Linux boxes re&shy;spec&shy;tive&shy;ly
for the last few months.
Git allows them to check in small changes locally without perturbing the build.
The ease of branching and merging allows them to work in more than one branch
at a time at a lower cost than Subversion did.
Most of our dev team continue to work in Subversion on Windows boxes.
git-svn allows Pavel and Eric to easily in&shy;ter&shy;op&shy;er&shy;ate with the Subversion server.
Pavel is also a big fan of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-stash.html">git-stash</a>:
he stacks away in-progress work and switches easily to other&nbsp;patches.</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve worked primarily in Python on Linux since the summer,
I&#8217;ve been working on our forth&shy;com&shy;ing mobile client recently.
It&#8217;s <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span>-based, hence I&#8217;m working on Windows again.
I&#8217;m in the throes of a major refac&shy;tor&shy;ing, extracting the mobile client
out of the main webclient and hoisting other code into shared projects,
while other developers continue to work on the main webclient
and the mobile&nbsp;client.</p>
<p>This seemed like a perfect op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ty to bite the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/dvcs-guide"><span class="caps">DVCS</span> bullet</a>,
since I knew that branching and merging would be less painful
with git-svn than with&nbsp;Subversion.</p>
<p>Getting git-svn working on Windows turned out to be a major headache.
The Cygwin version of git-svn simply <a class="reference external" href="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2008-10/msg00602.html">doesn&#8217;t work</a> for me.
And msysGit doesn&#8217;t <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/issues/detail?id=160">currently support</a> git-svn.
(Eric has had some success with an older version of msysGit and git-svn,
but I found it to be wretchedly slow.)
Moreover, Git&#8217;s in&shy;te&shy;gra&shy;tion with Windows is poor.
There&#8217;s nothing like <a class="reference external" href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">Tor&shy;tois&shy;eSVN</a> to ease developers into using&nbsp;Git.</p>
<p>Having written off Git on Windows for now,
it was time to try <a class="reference external" href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> (<tt class="docutils literal">bzr</tt>),
which has its own Subversion plugin, <a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/bzr-svn">bzr-svn</a>.
The version of bzr-svn that was available for Windows the week before last
was ancient, and <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr-svn/+bug/291361">promptly crashed</a>.
Jelmer, the developer, mailed me yesterday to say that there should be an
up-to-date copy of bzr-svn in the brand new 1.9 release of Bazaar.
I&#8217;ll try it at work tomorrow.
Windows doesn&#8217;t seem like an af&shy;ter&shy;thought for Bazaar;
indeed, <a class="reference external" href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/TortoiseBzr">Tor&shy;toise&shy;Bzr</a> offers Explorer&nbsp;in&shy;te&shy;gra&shy;tion.</p>
<p>On to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a> (<tt class="docutils literal">hg</tt>).
Alas, this has the weakest in&shy;te&shy;gra&shy;tion with Subversion.
There are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.momentaryfascinations.com/programming/how.to.use.mercurial.for.local.source.code.management.with.a.public.subversion.server.html">in&shy;struc&shy;tions</a> for doing it by hand (which is what I&#8217;m doing).
The <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.red-bean.com/sussman/?p=116">hg&shy;sub&shy;ver&shy;sion</a> extension looks promising, but is still&nbsp;immature.</p>
<p>Even so, Mercurial is what I&#8217;ve ended up using for the last week.
Partly because it didn&#8217;t bite me.
Partly because I like it best of the three.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/">Mercurial book</a> takes much of the credit for that.
Windows is a first-class client
and <a class="reference external" href="http://tortoisehg.wiki.sourceforge.net/">TortoiseHg</a> offers half-way decent Explorer&nbsp;in&shy;te&shy;gra&shy;tion.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not impressed with Git as software en&shy;gi&shy;neer&shy;ing;
it strikes me as an incoherent mess of C and Perl.
The attitude of su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or&shy;i&shy;ty from some Git proponents is off-putting.
I watched <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8">Linus Torvalds&#8217; Google techtalk</a> about Git on Friday;
he came across as a major jerk,
repeatedly calling anyone who uses Subversion an idiot.
I&#8217;d still recommend watching the video:
it gives good insight into the social aspects of
dis&shy;trib&shy;uted/de&shy;cen&shy;tral&shy;ized VCSes,
how very different they are from tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al cen&shy;tral&shy;ized VCSes,
and how they afford a different way of&nbsp;working.</p>
<p>Watching my compatriot <a class="reference external" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7724296011317502612">Bryan O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s Google techtalk</a> on Mercurial
this afternoon was a far more pleasant experience.
He talks more about workflow and&nbsp;im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion.</p>
<p>Both Bazaar and Mercurial are written in Python and
seem to be fairly well ar&shy;chi&shy;tect&shy;ed.
Frankly, if I do have to get my hands dirty in the code
(e.g., hg&shy;sub&shy;ver&shy;sion), I&#8217;d much rather hack in Python.
I did C/C++ for fifteen years and I&#8217;m sick of unmanaged&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>Anyway, Mercurial is where I&#8217;m going for now,
though I won&#8217;t cat&shy;e&shy;gor&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly rule out Bazaar or&nbsp;Git.</p>
