<p>My formerly trusty Casio Exilim <span class="caps">EX</span>-Z1000 camera went berserk one night in September.
The zoom lens wedged open and nothing I did would persuade it to retract
into the case or take more photos.
The zoom had grown a little tem&shy;per&shy;me&shy;n&shy;tal in the preceding month,
but I didn’t expect cat&shy;a&shy;stroph&shy;ic failure.</p>
<p>The other hardware failure was far more upsetting.</p>
<p>From Christmas until August, I ripped most of our <span class="caps">CD</span> collection
with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/">Exact Audio Copy</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Lossless_Audio_Codec"><span class="caps">FLAC</span></a> (Free Lossless Audio Codec).
Since <span class="caps">FLAC</span> is lossless and open source,
I figured I’d never need to rip the CDs again.
I also wrote a Python script to convert the FLACs to MP3s with <a class="reference external" href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/"><span class="caps">LAME</span></a>,
since MP3s are far smaller and all players handle MP3s.
I stored the FLACs on a Maxtor OneTouch <span class="caps">III</span> drive,
twin <span class="caps">750GB</span> <span class="caps">SATA</span> drives configured as <span class="caps">NTFS</span> on mirrored <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_1"><span class="caps">RAID</span> 1</a>.</p>
<p>A few minutes changing CDs here and there;
a few more minutes entering album metadata into <a class="reference external" href="http://www.readerware.com/music/index.html">Readerware <span class="caps">AW</span></a>.
Over the months, it really added up:
775 albums, 250 <span class="caps">GB</span> of FLACs, <span class="caps">45GB</span> of MP3s.
The MP3s were replicated on several machines,
but the FLACs and the Readerware <span class="caps">AW</span> database were stored
only on the OneTouch’s mirrored drives.
This drive became my primary backup solution.
When I had copied the latest data to it,
I’d power it down and store it in the fire safe.</p>
<p>You can guess what’s coming next.
The OneTouch stopped working one day.
Refused to do a damn thing on any machine that I connected it to.
I was <em>very</em> unhappy.</p>
<p>I was going to return it to Maxtor,
until I read the fine print.
They’d replace it, but they’d send me back different drives
and would make no attempt to get the data off the old drives.</p>
<p>Well, that was completely un&shy;ac&shy;cept&shy;able!
I found the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.erowid.org/devel/misc/archives/000083.shtml">Maxtor OneTouch <span class="caps">III</span> dis&shy;as&shy;sem&shy;bly</a> guide online,
but didn’t get around to doing anything about it until tonight.
I bought two 3.5" external enclosures at Fry’s yesterday.
A couple of hours ago, I voided the warranty by prising the case off,
extracting the drives, and putting them into the enclosures.</p>
<p>They worked! Both of them appear to be fine
and the data is accessible.
Until tonight, I wasn’t completely sure that I would be able to
get the data off the disks even if they were okay.
I had visions of having to extract sectors and rebuild the files by hand.</p>
<p>Presumably it’s the <span class="caps">RAID</span> controller or something else
in the Maxtor case that died.
I’m going to throw that piece of crap away.
One of the drives is undergoing a full chkdsk;
the other will get the same treatment tomorrow.</p>
<p>Not only that, but I also plugged the camera in for the first time
since it had died.
The battery had completely drained and I had to reset the clock.
And now it’s decided to work too.
I’m not sure that I trust it,
but should it die again, it’s no great loss.</p>
