<p>It&#8217;s been too long since I last posted an Odds <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Ends.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7ibPk37_U">Henri</a> is a very amusing short spoof of French&nbsp;ennui.</p>
<p>Back in January, Emma and I were being repeatedly shocked
by static elec&shy;tric&shy;i&shy;ty.
We would in&shy;ad&shy;ver&shy;tent&shy;ly discharge by kissing or
otherwise touching each other,
or by touching laptops or faucets.
Eventually, I realised that it was due to a com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion
of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf69496036.tip.html">microfiber upholstery</a> on our new couch
and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hardforum.com/showthread.php?p=1031999079">dry, unhumid air</a>.
We solved it by a com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion of rubbing an anti-static dryer sheet (Bounce)
on the couch and buying a humidifier.
That led to a spate of jokes about the spark being&nbsp;gone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s started coming back again.
I think it&#8217;s time to fondle the couch with more&nbsp;Bounce.</p>
<p>The Bad Sex Awards are, perhaps, Britain&#8217;s &quot;most dreaded literary prize&quot;.
Read about the <a class="reference external" href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2215521,00.html">2007 Bad Sex nominees</a>
in the Guardian, with <a class="reference external" href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2217735,00.html">excerpts</a>.
The late <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2217965,00.html">Norman Mailer won&nbsp;posthu&shy;mous&shy;ly</a></p>
<p>Ian Welsh makes a case that <a class="reference external" href="http://firedoglake.com/2008/02/09/its-not-your-money/">it&#8217;s not your money</a>,
in rebuttal to anti-tax&nbsp;lib&shy;er&shy;tar&shy;i&shy;ans.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I read that the last German veteran
of World War I had died.
Yesterday, I read that the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/13/world/europe/13ponticelli.html">last French veteran</a>
had just&nbsp;died.</p>
<p>Regarding the Spitzer pros&shy;ti&shy;tu&shy;tion scandal:
normally, I would have given a Democratic politician
the benefit of the doubt for a sex scandal.
After all, unlike the Re&shy;pub&shy;li&shy;can&shy;s—see
Larry ‘wide stance’ Craig;
David ‘Diaper’ Vitter (brother of my former professor at Brown, Jeff);
Mark Foley, et al—De&shy;mo&shy;c&shy;ra&shy;t&shy;ic politi&shy;cians
generally don&#8217;t make a big deal of “family values”.
Spitzer had done a good job of fighting corruption,
but breaking up pros&shy;ti&shy;tu&shy;tion rings had also been one of his signature issues,
as had pros&shy;e&shy;cut&shy;ing johns.
The whole thing bespeaks such massive stupidity and hypocrisy
that I say good riddance to&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>Several of us went to see Barack Obama at Key Arena last month
(<a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/george_v_reilly/sets/72157603875913625/">photos here</a>), the day before the Washington state primary.
The crowd more than filled Key Arena,
with at least 20,000 in attendance.
We ended up outside, as you can see from the photos,
which actually served us well,
as Obama stood outside and talked to the crowd for a few minutes
before heading into the stadium.
We got closer to him than we would have&nbsp;inside.</p>
<p>Anyway, John McCain spoke at the Westin Hotel that evening
and only managed to half-fill the ballroom,
which ac&shy;com&shy;mo&shy;dates 800 people.
In other words, the then-pre&shy;sump&shy;tive Republican nominee
could only pull as many people as attended
my caucus the next day.
There are hundreds of thousands of Re&shy;pub&shy;li&shy;cans within
an hour&#8217;s drive of Seattle, but only a few hundred of them
could summon the enthusiasm to see their guy in&nbsp;person.</p>
<p>I thought our caucus went well.
I helped the convener organize the whole event for eight precincts.
As the Precinct Committee Officer (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precinct_Committee_Officer"><span class="caps">PCO</span></a>) for <span class="caps">SEA</span> 11-1945,
I chaired our precinct&#8217;s caucus and was elected as a delegate for Obama,
which means that I will be attending the 11th Leg&shy;isla&shy;tive District
and the King County con&shy;ven&shy;tions next month.
I have no intention of trying to proceed further.
I don&#8217;t want to go to the Democratic National Convention in Denver in&nbsp;August.</p>
