<p>I&#8217;m voting for Obama, which is no secret to anyone who knows me.
I agree with his policies and I&#8217;m impressed by the man.
Over the last two years, he&#8217;s run an excellent campaign,
going from underdog to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2008/10/25/obamas_lead/">all-but certain victory</a>.
Clearly, he has executive&nbsp;ability.</p>
<p>Moreover, McCain is the wrong man for the job.
I strongly disagree with his policies (es&shy;sen&shy;tial&shy;ly Bush&#8217;s),
his campaign is thrashing spas&shy;ti&shy;cal&shy;ly,
and he dis&shy;qual&shy;i&shy;fied himself by picking that blithering idiot Palin as his&nbsp;<span class="caps">VP</span>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m more worried about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chrisgregoire.com/">Christine Gregoire</a>,
who is running for re-election as Governor of Washington.
She&#8217;s un&shy;com&shy;fort&shy;ably close in the polls to Dino Rossi.
The Building Industry As&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;a&shy;tion of Washington and
the Republican Governers&#8217; As&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;a&shy;tion have dumped $7.5 million
into Rossi&#8217;s campaign in the last few weeks.
You are known by your enemies, so she must be doing something right.
Gregoire, alas, is a competent governor, but an in&shy;dif&shy;fer&shy;ent&nbsp;campaigner.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.darcyburner.com/">Darcy Burner</a> is running for Dave Reichert&#8217;s Congress seat
over on the Eastside.
She too is polling un&shy;com&shy;fort&shy;ably close to her opponent.
Burner is a strong candidate, a former Microsoft manager,
and someone who&#8217;s already made her mark.
Her <a class="reference external" href="http://www.responsibleplan.com/">Re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;ble Plan</a> to end the war in Iraq
has been signed on to by dozens of Con&shy;gres&shy;sion&shy;al candidates.
Reichert has been a mediocre rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tive,
ranking around 400th of the 435 Congress members in&nbsp;influence.</p>
<p>This afternoon, I walked about half of my precinct,
trying to talk to voters who&#8217;ve been identified as Leans Democratic.
I&#8217;ll finish tomorrow, and try to get to some neigh&shy;bor&shy;ing precincts
over the next ten&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>What can <em>you</em>&nbsp;do?</p>
<p>First of all, vote!
If you have an absentee ballot, turn it in as soon as possible.
King County can only count so many votes per day;
the sooner the absentee ballots are mailed in,
the sooner the final tally.
<span class="caps">BTW</span>, the first all-mail election in King County will be February&nbsp;2009.</p>
<p>Second, spread the word.
Talk to all your friends who are per&shy;suad&shy;able and get them to vote
for Obama, Gregoire, and other good Democratic&nbsp;candidates.</p>
<p>Third, volunteer for the next ten days.
The campaign will be glad to have you.
Most of all, they want people to go door to door.
They also need people to call voters.
(I believe you can do this from your own home.)
If you&#8217;re not com&shy;fort&shy;able doing this—though,
really, it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> bad—they also need people to do data&nbsp;entry.</p>
<p>Fourth, volunteer on Election Day.
They need people to be poll watchers,
to go door to door to get people out,
and people to drive in&shy;ca&shy;pac&shy;i&shy;tat&shy;ed voters to the&nbsp;polls.</p>
<p>Finally, send money, if you can.
Cam&shy;paign&shy;ing is hideously expensive.
I&#8217;d love to see full public funding of elections,
but that&#8217;s not what we have to work with this&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>Go to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wa-democrats.org/">Washington State Democrats</a> to sign&nbsp;up.</p>
