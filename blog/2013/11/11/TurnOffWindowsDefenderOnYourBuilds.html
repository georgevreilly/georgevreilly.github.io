    <p>I've spent some time this evening profiling a Python ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion on Windows,
trying to find out why it was so much slower than on Mac or Linux.
The ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion is an in-house build tool which reads a number of config files,
then writes some output files.</p>
<p>Using the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vrplumber.com/programming/runsnakerun/">Run&shy;SnakeRun</a> Python profile viewer on Windows,
two things im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly leapt out at me:
we were running <tt class="docutils literal">os.stat</tt> a lot
and <tt class="docutils literal">file.close</tt> was really expensive.</p>
<p>A quick test convinced me that we were <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stat.html">stat-ing</a> the same files over and over.
It was a com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion of explicit checks and implicit code,
like <tt class="docutils literal">os.walk</tt> calling <tt class="docutils literal">os.path.isdir</tt>.
I wrote a little cache that memoizes the results,
which brought the cost of the <tt class="docutils literal">os.stats</tt> down from 1.5 seconds to 0.6.</p>
<p>Figuring out why closing files was so expensive was harder.
I was writing 77 files, totaling just over 1MB, and it was taking 3.5 seconds.
It turned out that it wasn't the UTF-8 codec or newline trans&shy;la&shy;tion.
It was simply that <em>closing</em> those files took far longer than it should have.</p>
<p>I decided to try a different profiler, hoping to learn more.
I downloaded the <a class="reference external" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh448170.aspx">Windows Per&shy;for&shy;mance Toolkit</a>.
I recorded a couple of traces of my ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion running,
then I looked at them in the Windows Per&shy;for&shy;mance Analyzer,
whereupon I saw that in each case, the CPU spike of my app
was followed by a CPU spike in MsMpEng.exe.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-vista-tips/what-is-msmpeng-exe/">What's MsMpEng.exe</a>? It's Mi&shy;crosoft&shy;'s an&shy;ti&shy;mal&shy;ware engine,
at the heart of Windows Defender.
I added my build tree to the list of excluded locations,
and my runtime <em>halved</em>.
The 3.5 seconds of file closing dropped to 60 mil&shy;lisec&shy;onds,
a 98% reduction.</p>
<p>The moral of this story is:
don't let your virus checker run on your builds.</p>
