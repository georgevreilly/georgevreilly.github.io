<p>Tuesday December 10th was my last day at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cozi.com">Cozi</a>.
I had recently rolled off a major project that lasted for most of a year,
and the timing was good to go do something else.
In my six years there,
I made lasting friend&shy;ships and I built a lot of software that makes me proud.
Cozi has about 15 engineers, small enough that I worked on most of the software,
notably on the web services that power everything else
and on the web client ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion,
though not, alas, on the iOS or Android ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions.
Cozi was a great place to work
and I knew I wanted to replicate what I valued there,
working with a team of engineers that I liked and respected,
building in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing software in a variety of tech&shy;nolo&shy;gies,
at a small company.</p>
<p>I started my job search just before Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing,
expecting to spend several weeks,
but I didn’t reckon with the demand in the Seattle market
for ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced software developers.
I sent out several ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions
and heard very little during Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing week.
The next week, my job search caught fire.
In the space of a little more than 24 hours,
I had set up interview loops or in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion&shy;als
with CEOs at four different startups.
I gave notice at Cozi later that week,
as it was apparent that I would be leaving soon.</p>
<p>I had heard back from all of the startups where I in&shy;ter&shy;viewed by Thursday of last week.
After con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;ing their offers,
I accepted a position at <a class="reference external" href="http://cookbrite.com/">CookBrite</a>,
a stealth-mode early-stage startup in Pioneer Square,
where I will be one of the first developers.
I’ve never joined a company so early before and I’m looking forward to the op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ty.
The founders have done a lot of planning and market research,
and I like what they’ve shown me.
I start there on Thursday, December 19th.</p>
<p>I knew that there was more demand than supply in the Seattle software market,
but I was still blindsided by the speed at which this came together.
There are a lot of jobs for talented software developers.
All modesty aside, I do have a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/georgevreilly">great résumé</a>.
In fact, CookBrite first contacted me a couple of weeks before I started looking,
via <a class="reference external" href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow Careers</a>.</p>
<p>Outside my tech bubble, I know it’s not so easy to find work.
Many of my friends are struggling on the margins,
as are millions of others, in America and elsewhere.
I wish I could spread some of that em&shy;ploy&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty fairydust around.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’m taking a few days off before starting my new job.</p>
