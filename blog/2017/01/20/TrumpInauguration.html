    <p>Twenty-eight years ago today,
I <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/20/TheOtherInauguration.html">attended George H.W Bush&#8217;s in&shy;au&shy;gu&shy;ra&shy;tion</a>.
By accident. Read <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/20/TheOtherInauguration.html">that post</a> for the rest of the&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t especially care for Bush Senior.
I certainly didn&#8217;t care for George W. Bush,
who was the worst <span class="caps">U.S.</span> president in my&nbsp;memory.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve just had one of the best.
Obama was a president of high personal character and competence.
His ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion had integrity and remained free of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/1/11/1619079/-Comparing-Presidential-Administrations-by-Arrests-and-Convictions-A-Warning-for-Trump-Appointees">scandals</a>.
He inherited an enormous economic mess and cleaned it up.
He introduced the Affordable Care Act,
something no other Democratic president managed.
He faced wholly un&shy;prece&shy;dent&shy;ed opposition and in&shy;tran&shy;si&shy;gence from the Re&shy;pub&shy;li&shy;cans,
who vowed early on to make him a one-term&nbsp;president.</p>
<p>In mid-2011, two young developer friends of mine took positions
at <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_presidential_campaign,_2012#Technology">Obama for America</a>, building the technology that helped re-elect Obama in 2012.
I had previously helped out with technology on the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/10/10/Approve71CreateAProfilePicture.html">Approve Referendum 71</a> campaign in 2009,
and I was somewhat interested in joining them.
After a phone interview with Harper Reed, the <span class="caps">CTO</span> of <span class="caps">OFA</span>,
he offered me a job sight unseen.
I thought about it, but declined.
It would have been a huge upset in our lives, a big paycut,
and I wasn&#8217;t as keen on President Obama in 2011 as I had been about Candidate Obama in 2008.
In hindsight, perhaps I should have taken the job.
It would have been a hell of an&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>After eight years of a decent president,
I am not looking forward to the Trump presidency.
I see him as dangerous, bel&shy;liger&shy;ent, thin-skinned, ill-prepared,
and profoundly unfit to be the most powerful man in the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>A huge Women&#8217;s March takes place tomorrow in Washington <span class="caps">DC</span>.
I have friends traveling from all over the country to take part.
A large Womxn&#8217;s March will also take place in Seattle.
Were it not for my recent <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2017/01/17/KneeWalker.html">heel operation</a>, I would be marching with them in Seattle.
I may still attend and watch from the&nbsp;sidelines.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been helping out a little with the technology at <a class="reference external" href="https://presterity.org/">Presterity</a>.
Jan Miksovsky co-founded Cozi where I spent six years.
Several weeks ago, he decided to bring some technology to bear on the Trump problem,
and he started Presterity,
a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.geekwire.com/2017/shocked-trump-win-seattle-tech-workers-start-news-site-presterity-limit-damage-can/">community project to crowd&shy;source in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion about the Trump ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion</a>.
I&#8217;ll be doing more with Presterity in the coming&nbsp;months.</p>
