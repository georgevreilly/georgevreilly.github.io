<p>Upon hearing of Richard Adams' recent death,
I reread <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down">Watership Down</a> for the first time in many years.
I first read it not long after Penguin published it in paperback.
I believe that I was given the book for my ninth birthday in 1974,
or perhaps for my tenth, but I think it was my ninth.
Certainly the giver was my godfather, my Uncle Gabriel,
who also gave me <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and the <em>Titus Groan</em> nov&shy;el&shy;s—other books which I reread many times.</p>
<p>I'm happy to report that <em>Watership Down</em> still holds up well, forty years on.
Some young rabbits strike out on their own,
leaving their old warren just before it's destroyed,
thanks to a pre&shy;mo&shy;ni&shy;tion from Fiver, the runt brother of Hazel.
After settling in at their new home at the peak of the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downland">down</a>,
the all-bachelor group realizes that it will all be for naught
if there are no does to raise new litters.
Having made friends with a gull named Kehaar,
Hazel enlists his help to locate other warrens.
Kehaar finds Efrafa, a large concealed warren run by the au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;tar&shy;i&shy;an General Woundwort.
Bigwig in&shy;fil&shy;trates Efrafa, liberates a collection of does,
and they escape from under the nose of General Woundwort.
However, they are tracked back to Watership Down, where Woundwort besieges them.</p>
<p>It's an epic tale of adventure and travel,
of self-discovery, subterfuge, and lapine trickery,
and of forging a band of exiles into a community.
One factor that eluded my nine-year-old self
was what would then have been called male chauvinism:
the does barely register as characters,
being primarily of interest as passive breeding machines.
The primary characters are well-drawn:
Hazel, who has leadership thrust upon him;
the sensitive Fiver;
big brash Bigwig, braver than most;
Blackberry, the in&shy;sight&shy;ful;
the stolid Holly;
and even the in&shy;domitable Woundwort.</p>
<p>A classic suitable for adults as well as children.</p>
