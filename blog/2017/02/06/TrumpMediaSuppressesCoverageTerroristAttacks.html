    <p>Donald Trump is now <a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/02/06/president-trump-is-now-speculating-that-the-media-is-covering-up-terrorist-attacks/">claiming</a>&nbsp;(WaPo):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speaking to the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Central Command on Monday,
President Trump went off his prepared remarks to make a truly stunning claim:
The media was in&shy;ten&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly covering up reports of terrorist&nbsp;attacks.</p>
<p>“You’ve seen what happened in Paris, and Nice.
All over Europe, it’s happening,” he said to the assembled military leaders.
“It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported.
And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it.
They have their reasons, and you understand&nbsp;that.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/trump-centcom-media-terror-cover-up/515823/">The Atlantic</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://news.vice.com/story/trump-accused-the-media-of-ignoring-terrorist-attacks">Vice</a>.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous on the face of it.
With literally billions of cellphone cameras in cir&shy;cu&shy;la&shy;tion
and hundreds of millions of people on social media,
how could a real terrorist attack be covered up?
And what would the media&#8217;s motivation be for this coverup?
And how would they all stay on message?
Someone would scoop them.
This is the kind of horseshit that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/06/trumps-suggestion-that-the-media-is-ignoring-terrorist-attacks-has-a-familiar-source-infowars/">InfoWars</a> flings&nbsp;around.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s another damned lie from Trump.
Whether it&#8217;s part of a deliberate plan or he&#8217;s making shit up in the moment,
it hardly matters.
Trump and Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer
and the rest of his ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion
are lying repeatedly and&nbsp;shame&shy;less&shy;ly.</p>
<p>After Trump won the election,
I en&shy;ter&shy;tained a faint hope
that the grave re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty of becoming the leader of the free world
might cause Trump to become a little more serious and measured.
As the pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial transition wore on, that hope died an ugly death.
Two weeks after the In&shy;au&shy;gu&shy;ra&shy;tion,
it&#8217;s very clear that Trump will lie about anything
and pick a fight with&nbsp;anyone.</p>
<p>There is worse to&nbsp;come.</p>
