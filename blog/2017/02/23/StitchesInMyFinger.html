    <img alt="Five Stitches in Left Index Finger" class="right-float" src="/content/binary/finger-stitches.jpg"/>
<p>I&#8217;ve had stitches before, but never from a self-inflicted cut.
Five stitches this morning
from a bread knife slipping on a stale loaf that I was going to toast.
I never did get that&nbsp;snack.</p>
<p>For&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, it hasn&#8217;t been painful.
The stitches should come out in 7â€“9 days.
Meanwhile, typing is awkward and&nbsp;slow.</p>
<p>My brother David when he was eight or nine nearly ruined his thumb with a chisel.
He was using it to make a wooden sign for his cub scout troop.
The chisel slipped and jammed into the back of his left thumb.
He didn&#8217;t sever the tendon and he got the full use of his thumb back,
but he still has an ugly&nbsp;scar.</p>
<p>Within a year or two of David&#8217;s accident,
my father lost the tip of his index finger.
He was making a deposit into a night safe
when some keys got in the way as the door swung closed.
He flipped them out of the way,
but his fingertip didn&#8217;t clear the gap in time.
For&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly his own father was present and took him for medical treatment.
He has a divot missing from the tip of his right index finger.
Vincent, unlike his children, is left-handed
so it wasn&#8217;t quite as much of a loss as it&nbsp;sounds.</p>
<p>Life!
No-one gets out without&nbsp;scars.</p>
