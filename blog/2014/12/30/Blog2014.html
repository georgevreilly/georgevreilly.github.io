    <p>My DasBlog-based blog at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/">http://www.georgevreil&shy;ly.com/blog/</a>
has been out of commission for months.
I&#8217;ve been meaning to replace it for a long time,
but I only just got around to making a serious effort,
as I realized that otherwise I would have no posts at all for 2014.
I received only a handful of complaints about its absence;
if there had been more, I would have fixed it&nbsp;sooner.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://dasblog.codeplex.com/">DasBlog</a> is a fairly light&shy;weight blogging engine that runs on <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span>.
It doesn&#8217;t require a database,
but it does require the ability to write <span class="caps">XML</span> blogpost entries to the local filesystem.
That&#8217;s a non-standard con&shy;fig&shy;u&shy;ra&shy;tion for <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> and <span class="caps">IIS</span> websites,
which inevitably causes problems.
Whenever the hosting company moved my site to another machine,
the blog always required special hand&shy;hold&shy;ing to get it running again.
The <span class="caps">CTO</span> of the hosting company has graciously hosted several sites of mine
at no cost for a decade, for which I&#8217;m thankful.
(I worked for him at another company in the mid–90s.)
Although DasBlog has served me well for that decade,
I&#8217;ve grown tired of it and of dealing with hosting&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the process of moving the blog to a <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2014/05/the-updated-big-list-of-static-website-generators-for-your-site-blog-or-wiki.html">static website generator</a>,
where I generate all the <span class="caps">HTML</span> and other files on my own computer,
and upload those generated files to the website.
Since there&#8217;s no dynamic code running on the server,
there&#8217;s very little to break down—or to be broken into.
I did this <a class="reference external" href="http://nwcpp.org/2013-website-refresh.html">two years ago</a> for the <a class="reference external" href="http://nwcpp.org/">Northwest C++ Users&#8217; Group website</a>,
when I moved it from a hosted instance of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a> <span class="caps">CMS</span>
to a static website generated by <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> at <a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.</p>
<p>Hundreds of static site generators exist,
but I had two criteria that reduced the list to three contenders,
<a class="reference external" href="http://posativ.org/acrylamid/">Acrylamid</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>.
The <span class="caps">SSG</span> <em>had</em> to support <a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html">re&shy;Struc&shy;tured&shy;Text</a> markup
and I strongly preferred that it be im&shy;ple&shy;ment&shy;ed in Python,
as that&#8217;s been my primary language since&nbsp;2008.</p>
<p>I have all 800+ of my old blog posts in re&shy;Struc&shy;tured&shy;Text files.
My old process had been to craft a reST-formatted blog post in Vim locally,
then to paste the generated <span class="caps">HTML</span> into DasBlog&#8217;s edit form.
The new process is still to edit the post locally,
but then to run a command to deploy the updated content.
I&#8217;m a developer.
I&#8217;m far more com&shy;fort&shy;able with reST and Vim and Git and command-line tools
than I am with writing in some second-rate <span class="caps">HTML</span> <span class="caps">WYSIWYG</span>&nbsp;editor.</p>
<p>I had extensive experience with Pelican, thanks to the <span class="caps">NWCPP</span> website.
It works well enough for a pure blog, where you always want the latest post first,
but its support for a mixed website where you have other articles is weaker.
Also, it&#8217;s slow at rebuilding the website since it rebuilds all files
whenever there&#8217;s a&nbsp;change.</p>
<p>I played briefly with Nikola over Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing
and I no longer recall why I preferred&nbsp;Acrylamid.</p>
<p>Acrylamid is faster than Pelican,
though its di&shy;ag&shy;nos&shy;tics when you have a syntax error are not great.
I don&#8217;t much care for the default theme but I&#8217;ve been too busy to try another one&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p>Mainly over the last few days,
I&#8217;ve been trying to port my content over to Acrylamid.
First, I extracted permalinks
from a copy of the original blog which is running in a Windows virtual machine
by spidering through all the posts.
Then I associated those permalinks with the original reST posts,
though many yet remain to be updated.
Finally, I&#8217;ve been working on a script that modifies the original posts
so that they&#8217;re structured in the way that Acrylamid wants them,
with the right re&shy;Struc&shy;tured&shy;Text metadata at the&nbsp;top.</p>
<p>The permalinks aren&#8217;t quite right,
as they all end in <tt class="docutils literal">.html</tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal">.aspx</tt>,
and of course they&#8217;re currently on the wrong&nbsp;domain.</p>
<p>As of now, I&#8217;m hosting this at <a class="reference external" href="http://georgevreilly.github.io/">http://georgevreil&shy;ly.github.io/</a>, on <a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.
I may later point the <tt class="docutils literal">www.georgevreil&shy;ly.com</tt> domain to GitHub Pages,
or I may set up my own Linux server later at Linode or <span class="caps">AWS</span> or somewhere&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>Unlike the <span class="caps">NWCPP</span> website, which is a Project Pages site at GitHub Pages,
this site is a <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/">User Pages</a> site.
The net effect of that is that I have to publish to the <tt class="docutils literal">master</tt> branch
of my Git repository instead of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gh-pages</span></tt> branch,
which threw me at&nbsp;first.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reasonably happy with the results so far, but more cleanup is&nbsp;required.</p>
