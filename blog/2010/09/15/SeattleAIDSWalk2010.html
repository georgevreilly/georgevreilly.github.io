<p>This year is the 24th an&shy;niver&shy;sary of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattleaidswalk.org/">Seattle AIDS Walk</a>.
A whole generation has passed since the Northwest AIDS Walk began.
AIDS used to be the un&shy;stop&shy;pable disease that killed much of
a generation of gay men.</p>
<p>AIDS is still a serious problem, but the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of an&shy;ti&shy;retro&shy;vi&shy;ral
drugs in the Nineties means that people with HIV
are living longer, healthier lives than before.
More than 1.5 million Americans are now living with HIV/AIDS:
9,000 of them in King County.
40,000 people are infected every year,
and most new infections are among African-Americans.
The U.S. is getting off relatively lightly:
about one-quarter of the adults in southern Africa have HIV!</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.llaa.org/">Lifelong AIDS Alliance</a> provides a variety of services to those living
with HIV/AIDS in Washington State.
LLAA cooks 190,000 fresh meals each year,
helps 3500 people,
provides case management for 1200 people,
provides 2300 people with health insurance support,
packs 45,000 grocery bags,
and dis&shy;trib&shy;utes condoms and safe-sex in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion to high-risk pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tions.</p>
<p>Donations to the Lifelong AIDS Alliance are down sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant&shy;ly over the last couple of years,
while the need for their services has grown in this perilous economy.
This year's goal is to raise $750,000 and recruit more than 4000 walkers.</p>
<p>I've walked in the AIDS Walk every year since 1992 and I've raised
thousands of dollars for AIDS.
Please help me raise money again for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattleaidswalk.org/">this year's walk</a>
on Saturday, September 25th.
I aim to raise at least <strong>$500</strong>.</p>
<p>You can sponsor me by going to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/aidswalk">http://www.georgevreil&shy;ly.com/aidswalk</a>.
I'm also a member of the <a class="reference external" href="http://tinyurl.com/fstm-aidswalk-2010">Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters team</a>.
We'd love to have you <strong>join us</strong> or <strong>sponsor us</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: Emma and I are having a fundrais&shy;ing barbecue on
Saturday, September 18th, noon to 5pm.
Email me for more details.</p>
<p>I thank you, the Lifelong AIDS Alliance thanks you,
and the people you'll be helping thank you.</p>
