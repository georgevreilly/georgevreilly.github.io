The Ninth Ward of New Orleans, as shot by
<a href="http://scoutprime.blogspot.com/2006/03/god-is-watching-us.html">Scout Prime</a>.
</div><p>Christy at Fire&shy;DogLake has written a post about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/06/01/its-hurricane-season-know-where-your-levee-is/">this year&#8217;s hurricane season</a>,
which officially started on June&nbsp;1st.</p>
<p>New Orleans and the rest of the Gulf is still a disaster area:
watch the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/v/es1gvu-5uKE">video</a>
linked to above.
Disaster pre&shy;pared&shy;ness is far from where it should be.
The levee im&shy;prove&shy;ments are inadequate.
Re&shy;con&shy;struc&shy;tion is mired in bu&shy;reau&shy;cra&shy;cy and stalled in in&shy;com&shy;pe&shy;tence.
The money promised has not ma&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;al&shy;ized.
Only one-third of New Orleans residents have&nbsp;returned.</p>
<p>Christy links to a <a class="reference external" href="http://democraticleader.house.gov/pdf/Katrina053106.pdf">report</a> put together by
Nancy Pelosi, detailing the in&shy;com&shy;pe&shy;tence and cronyism of the Re&shy;pub&shy;li&shy;cans,
both in the immediate response and in the long-term&nbsp;followup.</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Up to $1 billion dollars in waste and fraud for housing con&shy;trac&shy;tors and
payments made by the government, mainly to con&shy;trac&shy;tors from outside the
Gulf&nbsp;Region.</li>
<li>The <span class="caps">SBA</span> has rejected more than 60% of small business loan ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions
in the wake of Katrina. Of those that have been approved, only 4% of
funds have been disbursed to small business owners at this point. (Oh
yeah, I got yer business friendly en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment here. What was that
Republican talking point that small business is the backbone of
American jobs and&nbsp;com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ties?)</li>
<li>Less than 2% of all Federal aid that has gone to the Gulf Coast has
been used for education&nbsp;ex&shy;pen&shy;di&shy;tures.</li>
<li>The Rubber Stamp Republican Congress still refuses to ease Medicare
re&shy;stric&shy;tions for children in the Gulf Coast region, despite the fact
that there is a sub&shy;stan&shy;tial health care crisis for children in the
region, stemming from infections and other issues arising from
prolonged exposure to pathogens from flood waters, stress, and other
factors.  (1/3 of all children living in <span class="caps">FEMA</span> trailer parks have been
found to have a chronic&nbsp;illness.)</li>
<li>40,000 families are still waiting for some sort of housing assistance,
meanwhile there are 10,000 <span class="caps">FEMA</span> trailers still parked in the mud, just
sitting there&nbsp;unused.</li>
<li>Con&shy;trac&shy;tors with a political connection to the Bush Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion were
paid up to 15 times the actual cost of jobs&nbsp;contracted.</li>
</ul>
