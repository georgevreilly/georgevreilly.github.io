<p>I like my Americano made with 175F water to the top of the &quot;2&quot; oval, with
our standard ten-second stir, and press with no steep time.  Then diluted
1:1 after&nbsp;pressing.</p>
<p>Mark likes his brewed with much hotter water, with a 40 second steep time
and he likes to push all of the water through the press, rather than
diluting aftewards.   His recipe has much more edge (which I might call&nbsp;bitterness).</p>

<p>&quot;Espresso&nbsp;strength&quot;</p>
<p>I find that the drip-through, even with long steep or long stir times,
isn&#8217;t enough to affect the final brew.   So I think you can get where you
want to go without&nbsp;suction.</p>
<p>Fur&shy;ther&shy;more, you&#8217;ll get a richer extraction if you stir right up until you
press.  30 seconds of stirring will extract more than 30 seconds of&nbsp;steeping.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Rasqual: The best grind for an Aero press is definitely to the fine side of
drip, but not so fine as&nbsp;espresso.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AA</span>: My normal procedure is to push only about a half-inch, then hold that
pressure and wait about ten seconds for the pressure to move some liquid,
then push another half-inch, and repeat until the liquid has run through.
I like a grind that takes about ten to fifteen seconds total press time per
scoop of&nbsp;coffee.</p>
<p>Rasqual: lighter roasts profit from higher brewing tem&shy;per&shy;a&shy;tures in the&nbsp;Aero.</p>
<p>Rasqual: It&#8217;s a French Press with a filter, simply put. Therefore, it
allows complete control over extraction time, and the filter allows much
briefer extraction because you can use a finer grind. Yes, it&#8217;s a new
brewing method &#8211; but what it allows is just a greater range of variable
control than familiar methods it&#8217;s most like. You&#8217;re in familiar territory
with it. but with a whole new set of options. [Fewer&nbsp;&#8216;fines&#8217;]</p>
<p>Rasqual: I&#8217;ve long since discarded Alan&#8217;s water amount rec&shy;om&shy;men&shy;da&shy;tions. I
use about double his rec&shy;om&shy;mend&shy;ed quantity for a given amount of grind. I
don&#8217;t steep at all, I just stir until I press (which is simply to say I
accelerate&nbsp;steeping).</p>
<p>Gate: Tea definitely should <span class="caps">NOT</span> be squeezed. It makes it bitter. Never
squeeze a tea bag, by the way. This is par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly noticeable with mild
tasting teas, such as green, and maybe even more so with green jasmine, and
really, any jasmine or flower tea. I squeezed tea bags for years, not
realizing how much better tea could taste until I consulted with a lady who
ran a Chinese restaurant and whose tea was the best I&#8217;d ever tasted. If
you&#8217;re making your tea in an AeroPress, stop short of pressing to the
bottom, and let the leaves have a little&nbsp;room!</p>
<p>A very easy fix is to stand the <span class="caps">AP</span> on its head with the plunger set in
place then prepare the coffee in this &quot;inverted&quot; <span class="caps">AP</span>, cap with a filter and
the cap and then revert on top of the cup and press.  No muss, no fuss, no
drip through. More of the good stuff makes it into the cup&nbsp;also.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AA</span>: I like to give my AeroPress a shake to level the bed of coffee prior to
pouring in the water.   I also dribble the water in slowly for the first
few seconds to wet the bed.  I found that if I poured it in too fast, it
would oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;aly bore a hole right through the bed of coffee and run&nbsp;through.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AA</span>: Fill the plunger to halfway between the number 2 and the top of the
oval sur&shy;round&shy;ing the 2 with boiling water.  You can use boiling water from
a kettle, or fill it with cold tap water to this point, then nuke it until
it bubbles in the microwave.   Next add cold tap water to raise the level
to the number 3.  The mix will be about&nbsp;175F.</p>
<p>Planet: Fill the plunger 3/4 up the 2 range with just off-the-boil water,
and top off with re&shy;frig&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tor-cold water, to the top of the 2 range.  I
tested this method several times (letting the equipment return to room temp
each time) and was between 168 and 172.  A 4 degree variation within, all
within the in&shy;struc&shy;tion&#8217;s 10 degree rec&shy;om&shy;mend&shy;ed band, sounds really good to
me, especially as I need no timer and no&nbsp;ther&shy;mome&shy;ter!</p>
<p>Full&shy;Court&shy;Press: First, don&#8217;t back off the grind.  You&#8217;ll want to stay with
as close to an espresso grind as possible.  Try pre-wetting the filter,
before adding grinds.  This may seem coun&shy;ter&shy;in&shy;tu&shy;itive but I think it
expands the filter fibers before the micro-grinds can clog the pore spaces.
I have noticed a difference in force required with this one step alone.
You might try applying less force during the first 10 seconds of plunging,
then gradually increase force over the next 20 seconds.  If it takes more
than 30 seconds to plunge your coffee with probably be over-extracted.
This also probably means you have too much micro-grind or coffee dust in
your grind and you will need to grind coarser or get a better quality&nbsp;grinder.</p>
<p>DavidM&shy;Lewis: Coun&shy;ter&shy;in&shy;tu&shy;itive&shy;ly, to use a very find grind with the
Aeropress, you need to press very lightly. I now use a Zass Turkish
grinder, as fine as it can be made to go, and stir for 25 seconds. (I use a
much lighter roast, usually, than Alan favors.) I put the plunger in and
move it just until I see the top of the liquid column start to go down. I
then move very slowly, just keeping the distance from the plunger to the
liquid more or less constant. Pushing too hard forces the particles into
the filter paper, decreasing the flow. Almost no muscle strength required
at&nbsp;all.</p>
