<p>I found an in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5502785">piece</a>
on the <span class="caps">NPR</span> website about the modern anti-abortion&nbsp;movement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 1980s, in order to solidify their shift from divorce to
abortion, the Religious Right con&shy;struct&shy;ed an <em>abortion myth</em>, one
accepted by most Americans as true. Simply put, the abortion myth is
this: Leaders of the Religious Right would have us believe that their
movement began in direct response to the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Supreme Court&#8217;s 1973
<em>Roe v. Wade</em> decision. Po&shy;lit&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tive evan&shy;gel&shy;i&shy;cal leaders were so
morally outraged by the ruling that they instantly shed their
apolitical stupor in order to mobilize po&shy;lit&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly in defense of the
sanctity of life. Most of these leaders did so re&shy;luc&shy;tant&shy;ly and at great
personal sacrifice, risking the obloquy of their con&shy;gre&shy;gants and the
contempt of liberals and &quot;secular humanists,&quot; who were trying their
best to ruin America. But these selfless, courageous leaders of the
Religious Right, inspired by the opponents of slavery in the nineteenth
century, trudged dutifully into battle in order to defend those
innocent unborn children, newly endangered by the Supreme Court&#8217;s
misguided <em>Roe</em>&nbsp;decision.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a compelling story, no question about it. Except for one thing: It
isn&#8217;t&nbsp;true.</p>
<p>&#8230;-</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s remember, [Paul Weyrich] said animatedly, that the Religious
Right did not come together in response to the <em>Roe</em> decision. No,
Weyrich insisted, what got us going as a political movement was the
attempt on the part of the Internal Revenue Service (<span class="caps">IRS</span>) to rescind
the tax-exempt status of Bob Jones University because of its racially
dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;to&shy;ry&nbsp;policies.</p>
<p>&#8230;-</p>
<p>&quot;What caused the movement to surface,&quot; Weyrich reiterated,&quot;was the
federal government&#8217;s moves against Christian schools.&quot; The <span class="caps">IRS</span> threat
against segregated schools, he said, &quot;enraged the Christian community.&quot;
That, not abortion, according to Weyrich, was what galvanized
po&shy;lit&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tive evan&shy;gel&shy;i&shy;cals into the Religious Right and
goaded them into action. &quot;It was not the other things,&quot; he&nbsp;said.</p>
