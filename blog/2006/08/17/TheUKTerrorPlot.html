<p>Craig Murray, the former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, who was fired
for speaking out about Karimov&#8217;s use of torture,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/archives/2006/08/the_uk_terror_p.html">writes about the <span class="caps">UK</span> terror plot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been reading very carefully through all the Sunday newspapers to
try and analyse the truth from all the scores of pages claiming to
detail the so-called bomb plot. Unlike the great herd of so-called
security experts doing the media analysis, I have the advantage of
having had the very highest security clearances myself, having done a
huge amount of pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gence analysis, and having been
inside the spin&nbsp;machine&#8230;.</p>
<p>None of the alleged terrorists had made a bomb. None had bought a plane
ticket. Many did not even have passports, which given the efficiency of
the <span class="caps">UK</span> Passport Agency would mean they couldn&#8217;t be a plane bomber for
quite some&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>In the absence of bombs and airline tickets, and in many cases
passports, it could be pretty difficult to convince a jury beyond
reasonable doubt that in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;als intended to go through with suicide
bombings, whatever rash stuff they may have bragged in internet chat&nbsp;rooms&#8230;.</p>
<p>In all of this, the one thing of which I am certain is that the timing
is deeply political. This is more propaganda than plot. Of the over one
thousand British Muslims arrested under anti-terrorist leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;tion,
only twelve per cent are ever charged with anything. That is simply
har&shy;rass&shy;ment of Muslims on an appalling scale. Of those charged, 80% are
acquitted. Most of the very few - just over two per cent of arrests -
who are convicted, are not convicted of anything to do terrorism, but
of some minor offence the Police happened upon while trawling through
the wreck of the lives they had&nbsp;shattered.</p>
<p>Be sceptical. Be very, very&nbsp;sceptical.</p>
