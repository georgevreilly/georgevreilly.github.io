<h2>Vim vs. Visual&nbsp;Studio</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been an <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/12/30/20YearsOfVi.html">obsessive vi user</a>
for more than 20 years. Vi keystrokes are indelibly burned into my
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.oreilly.com/news/zenclavier_1299.html">muscle memory</a>.
When I have to use Notepad or Word or Visual Studio, I feel crippled.
I have to work harder to do simple things; I have to type too many chords
with Alt and Ctrl; I have to take my hands off the home keys to use the
cursor keys and the&nbsp;mouse.</p>
<p>In the mid-90s, I adopted <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a> (Vi IMproved)
to the point where I became a sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant con&shy;trib&shy;u&shy;tor, writing a big chunk of the
<a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/12/30/20YearsOfVi.html">Win32 code</a>.</p>
<p>While I was at Microsoft, I hardly ever used Visual Studio.
I edited my C/C++ code with Vim,
I compiled and linked it with the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.osronline.com/article.cfm?id=54"><span class="caps">NT</span> Build En&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment</a>
and I debugged it with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/default.mspx">WinDbg/ntsd/kd</a>.
I was hardly alone in this. In the Windows division, your code has to
build with the <span class="caps">NT</span> build en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment, and the Windows debuggers are much
better supported than the Visual Studio debugger for developing the&nbsp;<span class="caps">OS</span>.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m pro&shy;gram&shy;ming in C#, using the Visual Studio <span class="caps">IDE</span> makes a lot
more sense. <span class="caps">VS</span>&#8217;s In&shy;tel&shy;liSense for C# is much richer than
<a class="reference external" href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/vim/vim7/runtime/doc/version7.txt?view=markup">Vim7&#8217;s Omni completion</a>,
especially when coupled with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>,
and <span class="caps">VS</span> is the debugger of choice for managed code.
I&#8217;ve been spending a fair amount of time in the <span class="caps">VS</span> <span class="caps">IDE</span>, especially when
pair pro&shy;gram&shy;ming, but I&#8217;ve also been switching back to Vim a lot.
When I&#8217;m struggling with unfamiliar code, <span class="caps">VS</span>&#8217;s In&shy;tel&shy;liSense is a great comfort;
when I&#8217;m moving a lot of text around, Vim suits me far&nbsp;better.</p>

<h2>ViEmu</h2>
<p>Earlier this week, by way of its <a class="reference external" href="http://viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html">graphical Vim cheat sheet</a>,
I found an in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing compromise.
<a class="reference external" href="http://viemu.com/">ViEmu</a> is a vi/Vim emulator for <span class="caps">VS</span>-2003 and&nbsp;<span class="caps">VS</span>-2005.</p>
<p>ViEmu implements most of the vi keystrokes and many of the Vim extended
keystrokes, right inside the Visual Studio <span class="caps">IDE</span>.
It uses the native <span class="caps">VS</span> In&shy;tel&shy;liSense in place of Vim&#8217;s completion
functions. ViEmu even implements some of the more common Ex command line,
including most of the <tt class="docutils literal">:%s</tt> regular expression sub&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions.
The author, who seems to be known only as <span class="caps">JNG</span>, is responsive.
Within 24-hours of my reporting some missing keystrokes, he had
im&shy;ple&shy;ment&shy;ed them in a new minor&nbsp;release.</p>
<p>It does not, however, support VimL, the Vim extension language,
so if you have an extensive suite of Vim plugins, as I do, they&#8217;re not
going to work in&nbsp;ViEmu.</p>
<p>All in all, I&#8217;m favorably impressed with ViEmu.
It provides much of the muscle memory experience of Vim
inside of Visual Studio. Tech&shy;ni&shy;cal&shy;ly, it can&#8217;t have been easy to
impose such a radically different input model on <span class="caps">VS</span> or
to emulate Vim and Ex fairly&nbsp;faithfully.</p>
<p>Vim has always been free (actually <a class="reference external" href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/uganda.html">char&shy;i&shy;ty&shy;ware</a>),
but <span class="caps">JNG</span> <a class="reference external" href="http://viemu.com/purchase.html">charges</a> for ViEmu.
Right now, I&#8217;m in the 30-day trial period, but I fully expect
that I&#8217;ll pay for a license before the trial is&nbsp;up.</p>

<div class="section" id="visvim">
<h2>VisVim</h2>
<p>Vim comes with a Visual Studio add-in called VisVim, which is based on
another add-in called VisEmacs. It allows <span class="caps">VS5</span> and <span class="caps">VS6</span> to use Vim
as the default editor, albeit externally to the <span class="caps">IDE</span>: Vim continues to run
in its own&nbsp;window.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Bram asked me if I could get VisVim to compile with
<span class="caps">VS</span>-2003. I tried, but I was unable. Necessary headers are no longer
included with <span class="caps">VS</span>-2003 or <span class="caps">VS</span>-2005. No doubt this is because the Add-In
ar&shy;chi&shy;tec&shy;ture changed radically with the in&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;tion of Visual&nbsp;Studio-.<span class="caps">NET</span>.</p>
<p>Work is underway, albeit very slowly, to create
<a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.snowmoonsoftware.com/">VisEmacs.<span class="caps">NET</span></a>.
At some point, it may be worth creating a merger of VisVim and&nbsp;VisEmacs.<span class="caps">NET</span>.</p>

<h2>End&nbsp;Notes</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.dready.org/blog/section/viword/">viWord</a> allows you to use vi
key&shy;bind&shy;ings in Microsoft Word. It&#8217;s not nearly as full featured as ViEmu
and I found that I didn&#8217;t like it enough to keep it&nbsp;around.</p>
<p>This post was, of course, composed in Vim. I wrote it in lightly marked-up
plain text and converted it to <span class="caps">HTML</span> with <span class="caps">VST</span>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://skawina.eu.org/mikolaj/vst.html">Vim re&shy;Struc&shy;tured Text</a>.
Blogging with <span class="caps">VST</span> will be the topic of a future&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>To fully take advantage of Vim7&#8217;s Omni completion, you need a
patched version of <a class="reference external" href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">Exuberant Ctags</a>.
I&#8217;ve made a <a class="reference external" href="http://georgevreilly.com/vim/ctags.html">Win32 binary available</a>.</p>
