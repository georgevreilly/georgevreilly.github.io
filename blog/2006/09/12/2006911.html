<p>Nine-Eleven. The date burned into everyone's brain. One of those dates
where everyone remembers where they were when they heard the news.
Emma and I awoke to the radio telling us that planes had crashed into the
World Trade Center. We went downstairs and watched the TV in horror.</p>
<p>For a time, an all-too-brief time, the country pulled together
in a show of unity and grief. The world joined us in an outpouring of
support.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why history will condemn George Bush, but one of the
most serious is his squan&shy;der&shy;ing that good will for quick partisan
advantage. A better man could have built a bipartisan consensus to tackle
terrorism in a serious way. Ask not what your country can do for you --
just go shopping.</p>
<p>He should have finished the job in Afghanistan. Instead, his attention
turned to fomenting the irrational, immoral Iraq war, which
turned the world against us.</p>
<p>In many ways, the terrorists have won. This country slides slowly towards a
police state, as Bush arrogates imperial powers to himself. Bush and bin
Laden have a symbiotic re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship. Bush has turned Iraq into a recruiting
ground for Al Qaeda. Bin Laden is the ever-threat&shy;en&shy;ing boogeyman to scare
the American people.</p>
