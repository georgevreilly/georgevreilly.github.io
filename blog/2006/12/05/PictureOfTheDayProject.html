<p>About six weeks ago, I read about Sparky's <a class="reference external" href="http://codeforfood.org/2006/10/13/a-picture-a-day/">A Picture a Day</a> project
on his blog. He in turn had been inspired by Pho&shy;to&shy;jo&shy;jo's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.photojojo.com/content/tutorials/project-365-take-a-photo-a-day/">Project 365</a>.</p>
<p>Here's how it works, for me. I take at least one photo a day, every single
day for a year. Every so often, I upload the photos to <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/george_v_reilly/">my Flickr site</a>.
If I get more than one worthwhile photo in a day, great, but one and only
gets tagged <em>potd</em> (picture of the day).</p>
<p>Why? Apart from the reasons enumerated by Photojojo, here's what I get out
of it.</p>
<p>First of all, fun. It adds a little spark to my day, to be always
looking for photo ops.</p>
<p>Second, the constant practice makes me a better pho&shy;tog&shy;ra&shy;ph&shy;er.</p>
<p>Third, more photo editing and photo or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tion. His&shy;tor&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly,
I have been much better about taking photos than I have about
organizing them and editing them. This should get me off my duff about
going through the thousands of photos I've taken since I went digital in
2001, and posting the best of them.</p>
<p>Before I was inspired to start this project, I had been thinking about
getting a small point-and-shoot, like the Casio Exilim. When my parents
stayed with us and went to Hawaii with us a month before, I had played with
my mother's Exilim and liked it. My father had also had me order another
Exilim as a present for Michelle, and I had carried that around for a week.</p>
<p>I bought myself a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/casioz1000/">Casio Exilim EX-Z1000</a> at CostCo. It's 10 megapixels,
which I think is overkill, but even so, I can get more than 700 photos
on to a 2GB card. It came with a leather carrying case,
now a fulltime resident on my belt. I'm fairly happy with it, and I think
I've got some good results from it. But <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/george_v_reilly/sets/72157594404764314/">judge for yourself</a>.</p>
<p>I love my other camera, a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond70/">Nikon D70</a> digital SLR,
but it's far too bulky and heavy to carry with me all the time.</p>
<p>I finally uploaded the first 36 pictures to Flickr last night,
after working on them for most of the weekend. It would have been sooner,
but we spent 2.5 weeks in Ireland with wholly inadequate Internet access,
and I was quite busy before then.</p>
<p>From now on, I hope to post new POTD pictures two or three times a week.</p>
<p>The next few posts will talk about those first 36 photos in more detail.
I also intend to write up the workflow that I'm developing.</p>
