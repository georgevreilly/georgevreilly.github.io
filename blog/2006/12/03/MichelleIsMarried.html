<p>I noted at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2006/07/01/MichellesWedding.html">beginning of July</a>
that my sister Michelle was to be married to David Bowles
in Dublin in early November.</p>
<p>The wedding took place on Friday, November 10th. Emma and I arrived the
afternoon before, half stumbling with tiredness.
My brother, Mark, and his wife, Lizzy, had arrived
from New York only hours earlier.</p>
<p>The ceremony took place at 1pm at St. Brigid's,
a small, old Anglican church, on the outskirts of Stillorgan village,
long since absorbed into the Dublin met&shy;ro&shy;pol&shy;i&shy;tan area.
It was very <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Ascendancy">Ascendancy</a>, with 19th century plaques about
Fellow of the Royal College this and Brevet Colonel (Boer War) that.</p>
<p>The bride looked lovely, and I have the <a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/ethnamamamia/MichelleSWedding">photos</a> to prove it.</p>
<p>After the wedding, we all repaired to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.barberstowncastle.ie/">Bar&shy;ber&shy;stown Castle</a>
for the reception. There were, I think, 160 guests who partied late into
the night. Emma and I gave up around 1:30, exhausted from the jet lag.
My mother didn't get to bed until after 4am. Philip Bowles, David's father,
who had been undergoing chemother&shy;a&shy;py, was in fine form and stayed up nearly
as late.</p>
<p>Emma and I had arranged to stay a second night at Bar&shy;ber&shy;stown Castle,
and I ended up sleeping until 4pm on the Saturday,
trying to sleep off the drink and the jetlag.</p>
<p>The following week, my mother and I went through the nearly 400 photos
that she, Emma, David Reilly, and I had taken, and whittled it down to
74 rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tive ones. She badly wanted to send the photos to her friends
around the world, so I set up a <a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/ethnamamamia/MichelleSWedding">Picasa web album</a> for her and uploaded them.</p>
<p>Mark set up a site for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.michelleanddavid.net/">Michelle and David</a> before the wedding,
but it doesn't yet link to the photos.</p>
