<p>I sometimes joke that I must be adopted because my parents have no aptitude
for computers. I could make a similar joke about writing. Many of my
immediate family, despite decent educations, seem to be incapable of
writing a simple English sentence, much less a coherent&nbsp;paragraph.</p>
<p>One relative writes emails that are bereft of punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion: neither a comma
nor a full stop (period) is to be found. Capital letters occur, but too
randomly for my liking. And everything is linked into one paragraph, no
matter how long or disjointed. Yet, I&#8217;ve received adequately punctuated
hand&shy;writ&shy;ten letters and postcards from him. I attribute his email
sloven&shy;li&shy;ness to a com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion of laziness and hunt-and-peck typing.
Whatever the cause, it reflects poorly on&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>John Scalzi has some
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/004023.html">Writing Tips for Non-Writers Who Don&#8217;t Want to Work at Writing</a>.
Here&#8217;s the&nbsp;summary:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="0">
<li><em>Speak what you write</em> &#8230; If what you&#8217;re writing is hard to speak, what makes you
think it&#8217;s going to be easy to read? It won&#8217;t be.&nbsp;&#8230;</li>
<li><em>Punctuate, damn you</em>: For God&#8217;s sake, is it really so hard to know where
to put a comma?&nbsp;&#8230;</li>
<li><em>With sentences, shorter is better than longer</em>.</li>
<li><em>Learn to friggin&#8217; spell</em>.</li>
<li><em>Don&#8217;t use words you don&#8217;t really know</em>.</li>
<li><em>Grammar matters, but not as much as anal grammar Nazis think it does</em>.</li>
<li><em>Front-load your point</em>.</li>
<li><em>Try to write well every single time you write</em>.</li>
<li><em>Read people who write well</em>.</li>
<li><em>When in doubt, simplify</em>.</li>
<li><em>Speak what you write</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Go read the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/004023.html">whole thing</a>.</p>
<p>I found some useful links in the comments that follow Scalzi&#8217;s&nbsp;Tips:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/02/15/180927.php">One Simple Rules: Use the Active&nbsp;Voice</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/commas.html">Commas, Commas, and More Commas</a>,
for when you&#8217;ve mastered the preceding&nbsp;rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here&#8217;s a few tips of my&nbsp;own:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>One thought per paragraph</em>. Run-on paragraphs offend me and annoy me.
If a paragraph has more than four sentences, it&#8217;s probably too&nbsp;long.</li>
<li><em>Pick up something that was written by a competent writer who you enjoy
and analyze a page</em>. Why did they choose to break sentences where they
did? Why are the commas placed where they are? Do the paragraph breaks
make sense? What about the word choice? Did it clearly and succinctly
convey their ideas, their tone? (Hell, just analyze this&nbsp;post.)</li>
<li><em>Think before you write</em>. Before you dive in headlong, what is it you&#8217;re
trying to convey? This doesn&#8217;t have to take you very long. A few seconds
before a short email is&nbsp;enough.</li>
<li><em>Reread what you wrote, before you send it off</em>. Revising mistakes is so
easy on a computer that you have no excuse for not&nbsp;bothering.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn&#8217;t enough to turn you into a pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al writer, but it will make
a marked im&shy;prove&shy;ment in what you&nbsp;write.</p>
