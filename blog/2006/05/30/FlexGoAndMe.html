Bill Gates and Will Poole showing FlexGo at WinHEC.
</div><p>Nearly two years ago, I said that I was back at Microsoft,
<a class="reference external" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/george_v_reilly/archive/2004/09/26/234349.aspx">as a contractor</a>.
A year later, I said that I was moving on, because my <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/09/18/JobHunting.html">12 months were up</a>.
In both cases, I said that I was doing some really in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing work and
that I hoped to be able to talk about it some&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>Now the truth can be told: I was working on
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/flexgo/default.mspx">FlexGo</a>,
Microsoft&#8217;s new prepaid/sub&shy;scrip&shy;tion versions of Windows.
FlexGo was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/may06/05-21EmergingMarketConsumersPR.mspx">announced last Monday</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/2006/05-23WinHEC.asp">unveiled the next day at WinHEC</a>
(transcript of BillG&#8217;s speech; FlexGo is at the end).
The <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/271040_msftflex22.html">Seattle P-I article</a>
has a good&nbsp;overview.</p>
<p>My former colleague, Gokul Thirumalai, has several posts up at his blog:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gocool.org/?p=658">initial an&shy;nounce&shy;ment</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gocool.org/?p=659">WinHEC</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gocool.org/?p=660">WinHEC video</a>.</p>
<p>There was some spec&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion a few months ago about
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hunterstrat.com/news/2006/03/20/microsofts-other-secret-hardware-project/">a secret hardware project between Microsoft and Transmeta</a>.
The spec&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion was pretty wild, but the real project was the secure
hardware platform that Transmeta put together for FlexGo:
<a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/271014_software22.html">Mystery deal is high-security chip for &#8216;FlexGo&#8217;</a>.
Someone has taken some
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.aeroxp.org/board/index.php?showtopic=3732">pictures</a>
of the Transmeta system at&nbsp;WinHEC.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.technologypundits.com/index.php?article_id=310&amp;print=1">Technology Pundits Analysis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What makes FlexGo key to the success of this program is the timing
based software and security that is built into one of these low cost
<span class="caps">PC</span>’s. FlexGo lets the Telco or Cable companies providing the <span class="caps">PC</span> manage
the minutes used via prepaid cards tied directly to the <span class="caps">PC</span>’s abilities.
Let’s say that a person buys a 60 minute prepaid card. The Internet
connection to the system will work for 60 minutes and then it is shut
off completely until the person buys more minutes. Of course, the <span class="caps">PC</span>
itself is not disabled so they could do normal off line work. However,
the system is designed so that the Cable or Telco can even shut down
and disable the system via a locked down mode if someone tries to hack
it or abuses&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>This is especially true of the special system Microsoft and Transmeta
created. Two years ago, Microsoft paid Transmeta $10 million to help
them develop what turns out to be a truly secure system in which the
cable or telecom provider has control of the system and it is virtually
hack proof. <span class="caps">AMD</span> uses the Secure <span class="caps">BIOS</span> from Phoenix in their offerings
but it does not work the same way the Microsoft/Transmeta system does.
That is because Transmeta created specific en&shy;hance&shy;ments to their 1.1
GHz effecion processor and tied their secure layer to <span class="caps">CMS</span> and not to
the <span class="caps">BIOS</span> itself. This co-de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment work was critical to Mi&shy;crosoft&shy;’s
thinking about the project; in fact, they own this special system and
design which has to be licensed directly from Microsoft along with the
special <span class="caps">XP</span> Home edition and Transmeta just gets a royalty on every
processor&nbsp;sold.</p>
