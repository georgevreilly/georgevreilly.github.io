<p>I just listened to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thislife.org/">This American Life</a>
on the radio. I am con&shy;tin&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly amazed at just how good this show is.
They find so many compelling&nbsp;stories.</p>
<p>This week, Ira Glass in&shy;ter&shy;viewed Gene Cheek, who wrote a memoir,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1592286267/georgvreill-20">The Color of Love: A Mother&#8217;s Choice in the Jim Crow South</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, Cheek&#8217;s divorced mother fell in love with Tuck,
a black man. They lived in a small town in North Carolina, and the
mis&shy;ce&shy;gena&shy;tion laws were still on the books. They dated clan&shy;des&shy;tine&shy;ly, but
eventually their re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship become known. The police would stop by
regularly to harass them. After she had a baby by Tuck, her own family
refused to have anything to do with&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>One day, Cheek&#8217;s mother went to court, in an attempt to collect
child-support payments for Gene from his alcoholic father. When she and
Gene got there, they realized that the case being heard was a child-custody
case. She was given the ultimatum: give up her infant mixed-race son or
give up her 12-year-old son. His father said that he couldn&#8217;t take Gene in,
and neither could his uncle or his grand&shy;moth&shy;er.
Gene vol&shy;un&shy;teered to leave his mother, and he was sent to a foster
home. He began acting out and was eventually sent to a boy&#8217;s prison, 200
miles from home, where he spent five&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>Years later, after the ban on in&shy;ter&shy;ra&shy;cial marriages was overturned in
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia">Loving v.-Virgina</a>,
Cheek&#8217;s mother married&nbsp;Tuck.</p>
<p>I was horrified by this story, by the barbarity of it, by the racism.
Thank God this can no longer&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>Yet it does. Gay parents still have to contend with
the pre&shy;sump&shy;tion that they are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.abanet.org/irr/hr/summer03/custody.html">unfit parents</a>
in more benighted parts of the country.
For&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sodomylaws.org/lawrence/lwnews078.htm">Lawrence v.-Texas</a>
is over&shy;turn&shy;ing this pre&shy;sump&shy;tion, but this issue is far from settled.
The bigots are pushing to enact a Federal Marriage Amendment
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=Federal_Constitutional_Marriage_Amendment"><span class="caps">HRC</span></a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Marriage_Amendment">Wikipedia</a>)
which would certainly affect custody rights for <span class="caps">LGBT</span>&nbsp;parents.</p>
