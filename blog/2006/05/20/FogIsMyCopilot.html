<p>I mentioned last week that <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/05/15/WritingClearly.html">my parents have no aptitude for computers</a>.</p>
<p>My father emailed me with a list of computer woes; notably, he was getting
messages about no firewall. There was no way I was going to get to the
bottom of the issue just by email or talking to him on the phone. It&#8217;s
5,000 miles from Seattle to Dublin, so I can&#8217;t drop by to take a look at
the computer in person&#8211;much as my parents would like to have me&nbsp;visit.</p>
<p>I had tried using the built-in Windows Remote Assistance to trou&shy;bleshoot
issues on their laptop a couple of years ago, while they were on a
protracted stay in Cape Town. I had solved the problem, but that had been
fairly painful for me. The primary problem was the horrible slug&shy;gish&shy;ness of
the connection: they were on a slow dialup connection and the latency is
something fierce. Another problem was the fragility of my control: if I
dismissed a dialog by hitting Escape, I stopped con&shy;trol&shy;ling the remote
desktop, and as a <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/12/30/20YearsOfVi.html">longtime vi user</a>, I have certain
deeply ingrained reflexes that are hard to&nbsp;overcome.</p>
<p>I decided to try out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/AardvarkMidtermReport.html">Joel Spolsky&#8217;s Copilot</a>.
The Copilot service <a class="reference external" href="https://www.copilot.com/tech/">builds on TightVNC</a>.
The helper and the person being helped both make outbound con&shy;nec&shy;tions to a
Copilot server, which proxies the virtual session, neatly avoiding all
kinds of <span class="caps">NAT</span> issues that can arise when you try to make a direct connection
through a firewall. It&#8217;s also supposedly easy to configure, requiring only
a visit to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.copilot.com/">Copilot website</a> and typing in
an email address or a 12-digit number, before down&shy;load&shy;ing a half-megabyte
executable.
It wasn&#8217;t too painful to talk my father through making the connection,
though the first time that he did it, he &quot;lost&quot; the binary and had to
download it again. We initially tried the two-minute trial version, but
that wasn&#8217;t nearly enough time to do anything, so I shelled out the $10 for
a day&nbsp;pass.</p>
<p>In Dublin, as in Cape Town, he dials up to the Internet on a 56K modem, and
that once again proved to be the primary source of pain for me. It seemed a
little less sluggish than I remembered Remote Assistance being, but I
wasn&#8217;t about to subject myself to trying that out too. The experience
varied between tolerable and in&shy;fu&shy;ri&shy;at&shy;ing, but there&#8217;s only so much that can
be done at a little over&nbsp;3Kbps.</p>
<p>The second reason the experience was so painful was that I ended up needing
to repair the eTrust in&shy;stal&shy;la&shy;tion, and to download a full set of antivirus
signatures, and I simply couldn&#8217;t do it. The eTrust <span class="caps">FTP</span> site kept dropping
the connection, and the full signature package takes over 20 minutes to
download. I blame the <span class="caps">FTP</span> server, as I was <span class="caps">VPN</span>&#8217;d in to his laptop the
whole time, so his Internet connection was obviously working. I eventually
gave up at <span class="caps">4AM</span> <span class="caps">PDT</span>, in utter&nbsp;frus&shy;tra&shy;tion.</p>
<p><em>Verdict</em>. Copilot works fairly well, although it can be painful over a
dialup connection. I would have killed for a file-transfer facility so that
I could send files directly between his computer and mine. $10 for a day
pass isn&#8217;t cheap, but he gets to pay it in future! I use Terminal Server
and Virtual <span class="caps">PC</span> regularly: both of them provide ways to press all of the
Windows keys
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/mstsc_use_shortcut_keys.mspx">Terminal Server</a>,

Copilot&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t.</p>
