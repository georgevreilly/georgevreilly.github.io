    <p>I hang out on the Source&shy;Forge-hosted
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.inkscape.org/mailing_lists.php">inkscape-user</a> mailing list,
where I pick up useful tips for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>
<span class="caps">SVG</span> editor (vector drawing&nbsp;program).</p>
<p>For months, the list has been plagued with spam; largely because anyone can
send to the list. The policy has been not to require new users to sign up
for the list before being able to send questions. This is com&shy;mend&shy;ably
friendly and user-centric, but the spam has become a real&nbsp;annoyance.</p>
<p>One of the Inkscape developers finally said that, if a dozen or more people
said &quot;yes, restrict posting to list members only&quot; and no-one opposed it, he
would lock the list down. I attempted to vote yes and got the following
rejection letter from&nbsp;Source&shy;Forge:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;inkscape-user&#64;lists.sourceforge.net&gt;:
66.35.250.206 does not like recipient.
Remote host said: 550-Postmaster verification failed while checking &lt;george&#64;reilly.org&gt;
550-Called:   205.158.62.206
550-Sent:     RCPT TO:&lt;postmaster&#64;reilly.org&gt;
550-Response: 550 &lt;postmaster&#64;reilly.org&gt;: User unknown
550-Several RFCs state that you are required to have a postmaster
550-mailbox for each mail domain. This host does not accept mail
550-from domains whose servers reject the postmaster address.
550 Sender verify failed
Giving up on 66.35.250.206.

<p>Such irony! I had received a similar bounce a few days before from the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki/FlexWikiMailingList.html">FlexWiki-Users</a>
mailing list, which is also hosted by Source&shy;Forge, when I announced
<a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/05/04/VimSyntaxHighlightingForFlexWiki.html">Vim Syntax High&shy;light&shy;ing for FlexWiki</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t own the <tt class="docutils literal">reilly.org</tt> domain. It (and thousands of others) are
owned by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.netidentity.com">Ne&shy;tI&shy;den&shy;ti&shy;ty</a>. I had an exchange
with their postmaster, who said in&nbsp;part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did talk to source&shy;forge.  They claimed it is an essential part of their spam
filtering process to reject domains that dont have a postmaster&nbsp;mailbox.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried that (at least on a test basis) myself and with all due respect to
them, it is passe&#8217; &#8230; doesnt work too well.  And it has the added &quot;advantage&quot;
of having to connect back to the sending mail domain every time to see if a
postmaster for that domain exists.  This holds up email and creates additional
smtp con&shy;nec&shy;tions - and hence even more load on mailservers, in the case of
domains - with postmaster up and running - that are forged into&nbsp;spam.</p>
<p>I did suggest a few more rather efficient (and practical) filters they could
use, but well, they didnt respond to&nbsp;those</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has since added a postmaster mailbox for reilly.org, so I can post to
Source&shy;Forge lists&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>The Inkscape vote passed, of course. Only sub&shy;scribers can post now.
Non-sub&shy;scribers can also use a webform to send questions, so it&#8217;s not a big&nbsp;impairment.</p>
