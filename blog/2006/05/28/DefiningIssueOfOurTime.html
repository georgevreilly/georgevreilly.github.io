<p>Jamison Foser writes on the <a class="reference external" href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200605260016">defining issue of our time</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The defining issue of our time is not the Iraq war. It is not the
"global war on terror." It is not our inability (or un&shy;will&shy;ing&shy;ness) to
ensure that all Americans have access to affordable health care. Nor is
it im&shy;mi&shy;gra&shy;tion, out&shy;sourc&shy;ing, or growing income inequity. It is not
education, it is not global warming, and it is not Social Security.</p>
<p>The defining issue of our time is the media.</p>
<p>The dominant political force of our time is not Karl Rove or the
Christian Right or Bill Clinton. It is not the ruth&shy;less&shy;ness or the
tactical and strategic su&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;or&shy;i&shy;ty of the Re&shy;pub&shy;li&shy;cans, and it is not
your favorite theory about what is wrong with the Democrats.</p>
<p>The dominant political force of our time is the media.</p>
<p>Time after time, the news media have covered pro&shy;gres&shy;sives and
con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tives in wildly different ways – and, time after time, they do
so to the benefit of con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tives.</p>
<p>Consider the last two presidents. Bill Clinton faced near-constant
media obsession with his "scandals," while George W. Bush has gotten
off com&shy;par&shy;a&shy;tive&shy;ly easy.</p>
<p>…-</p>
<p>At this point, you’d have to be blind to miss the pattern. Every
prominent pro&shy;gres&shy;sive leader who comes along is openly derided in the
media as fake, dishonest, conniving, out-of-the-mainstream, and weak.
We simply can’t continue to chalk this up to short&shy;com&shy;ings on the part
of Democratic candidates or their staff and con&shy;sul&shy;tants. It’s all too
clear that this will happen regardless of who the candidate or leader
is; regardless of who works for him or her. The smearing of Jack Murtha
should prove that to anyone who still doubts it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look what happened to Al Gore in the run-up to the 2000 election versus how
George Bush was treated then by the media. Gore, the well-qualified
candidate, was subjected to an endless barrage of ridiculous stories
accusing him of everything from fraud&shy;u&shy;lent&shy;ly claiming to have invented the
Internet, to being the in&shy;spi&shy;ra&shy;tion for <em>Love Story</em>. Meanwhile, Bush was
making all kinds of nonsense claims for his tax cuts, and his insider
trading at Harken was being completely overlooked.</p>
