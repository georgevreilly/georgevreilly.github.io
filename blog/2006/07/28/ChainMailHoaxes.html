<p>I got an email earlier today from one of my relatives who has ties to South
Africa, which&nbsp;read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week a 3 year old girl (in South Africa ) was beaten and raped. She is
still alive. The man re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;ble was released on bail yesterday. He is
walking the streets. If you are too busy to read this then just sign your
name and forward this on. The Government is planning to close the child
protection unit and this is a petition against it. This is a very important
petition. It is an essential part of the justice system for children. You
may have already heard that there&#8217;s a myth in South Africa that having sex
with a virgin will cure <span class="caps">AIDS</span>. The younger the virgin, the more potent the
cure. This has led to an epidemic of rapes by infected males, with the
cor&shy;re&shy;spon&shy;dent infection of innocent kids. Many have died in these cruel
rapes. Recently in Cape Town, a 9-month-old baby was raped by 6 men. Please
think about that for a moment. The child abuse situation is now reaching
cat&shy;a&shy;stroph&shy;ic pro&shy;por&shy;tions and if we don&#8217;t do something, then who&nbsp;will?</p>
<p>Kindly add your name to the bottom of the list and please pass this on to as
many people as you know. If you are signature no.: 120 please forward the
mail-list to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:childprotectpca@saps.org.za">child&shy;pro&shy;tect&shy;p&shy;ca&#64;saps.org.za</a></p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t be complacent, do something about the kids of South Africa. You
can make a difference. That child is fighting for life. This is just 1of the
million cases of child abuse, so please pledge your support and help keep
<span class="caps">CPU</span> (<span class="caps">CHILD</span> <span class="caps">PROTECTION</span> <span class="caps">UNIT</span>) open. Please give your support to the petition
and ensure that it goes to as many people as possible. Please don&#8217;t just
leave it, make a difference. In order to write your name copy this messege
and paste it in a new mail (compose). Or click on forward and add your name
to the list and send it on to&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>Again, if you are number 120 please send this to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:childprotectpca@saps.org.za">child&shy;pro&shy;tect&shy;p&shy;ca&#64;saps.org.za</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Lots of forwards stripped, as well as 97 signatures from South Africa,
India, Nepal, the <span class="caps">UK</span>, and&nbsp;Australia.]</p>
<p>My immediate reaction was that this has to be a hoax. It has all the&nbsp;hallmarks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Alarmist subject&nbsp;matter</li>
<li>Un&shy;sub&shy;stan&shy;ti&shy;at&shy;ed assertions (but see note&nbsp;below)</li>
<li>Pass this letter on to everyone you&nbsp;know</li>
<li>No dates, no end&nbsp;dates</li>
<li>No&nbsp;provenance</li>
</ul>
<p>Admittedly, many <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hoax-slayer.com/petition-value.html">well-meaning but in&shy;com&shy;pe&shy;tent&shy;ly written petitions</a> share the same&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I wrote back to everyone whose email address I could mine out
of what I had been&nbsp;sent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop! It&#8217;s a hoax. Do <span class="caps">NOT</span> un&shy;crit&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly believe everything you get in&nbsp;email.</p>
<p>First thing you should do when you get a chain letter urging you to send
email to everyone you know, is to Google around to see if it&#8217;s horseshit.
Nine times out of ten it will&nbsp;be.</p>
<p>The first link that shows up when you google for &quot;child&shy;pro&shy;tect&shy;p&shy;ca chain
letter&quot; is&nbsp;this:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.joewein.net/hoax/hoax-saps-child-protection-unit.htm">http://www.joewein.net/hoax/hoax-saps-child-protection-unit.htm</a></blockquote>
<p>Which led me to the South African Police&nbsp;Service:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.saps.gov.za/_dynamicModules/internetSite/faqBuild.asp?myURL=242">http://www.saps.gov.za/_dy&shy;nam&shy;ic&shy;Mod&shy;ules/in&shy;ter&shy;net&shy;Site/faqBuild.asp?myURL=242</a></blockquote>
<p>Snopes.com is the go-to site for all Internet hoaxes. Here&#8217;s what they
have to say about this&nbsp;one:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/petition/babyrape.htm">http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/petition/babyrape.htm</a></blockquote>
<p>If you read any of these links, read this one. Then look around the
Snopes website and get a feel for some of the crap that&#8217;s out&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Now, please go and forward <span class="caps">THIS</span> email to everyone you forwarded the
previous email to, and also send this email to everyone who sent you
the chain letter in the first place. Stamp it out before it spreads
any&nbsp;further.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note: Snopes indicates that some of the rape stories mentioned in this
letter are true. A nine-month-old girl really was raped, though it turns
out that it wasn&#8217;t the six men who were initially arrested, but the
ex-boyfriend of the&nbsp;mother.)</p>
<p>I later followed up with the somewhat&nbsp;softer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me just add&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Hoax chain letters are a bad thing because some twit thinks it&#8217;s fun to
cause trouble and spread lies. This one has been cir&shy;cu&shy;lat&shy;ing for four
years. I&#8217;m sure it will still be turning up in four years&#8217;&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>About their only redeeming feature is that they get good-natured, if naive,
people such as yourselves to do a little something in an attempt to make
the world a better place. If these hoax letters actually achieved something
con&shy;struc&shy;tive, I wouldn&#8217;t mind nearly so&nbsp;much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve shot down a few chain letters before. Every single time, Snopes has
already written up an extensive page about&nbsp;it.</p>
