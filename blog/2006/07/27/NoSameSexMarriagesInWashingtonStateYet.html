<p>Well, fuck! The Washington State Supreme Court handed down its long-awaited decision
today on the con&shy;sti&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ty of the state&#8217;s Defense of Marriage Act.
Somehow, they found that it didn&#8217;t violate the state con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&#8217;s Equal
Protection&nbsp;clause.</p>
<p>No same-sex marriages in Washington state anytime&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>I attended the <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/279042_samesex27.html">rally at the First Baptist church</a>
earlier this evening. (Find me in the photo!)
Some anger, some dis&shy;ap&shy;point&shy;ment. Mostly upbeat.
The young Latina couple were very affecting.
The Serkin-Pooles invited everyone to join their club,
as they announced their formal engagement to each other.
One speaker pointed out that even if the court had handed down a favorable
decision, the process would not have been&nbsp;over.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we fight another day. I&#8217;ve been supporting same-sex marriage since
1993, when I heard of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.qrd.org/qrd/orgs/HERMP/">Hawaii Equal Rights Marriage Project</a>. I didn&#8217;t expect the war to end
today, though it would have been nice to win this&nbsp;battle.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">LMA</span> have more on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lmaw.org/wacourtdecision.htm">what it all means</a>.</p>
<p>Dahlia Lithwick at Slate ably skewers the court&#8217;s decision in
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2146580/">Rational Lampoon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you vote to uphold the ban, on the other hand, you&#8217;ll get to join
your colleagues on the New York and Nebraska courts, who just did the
same thing. You&#8217;ll also find yourself in the warm embrace of your
buddies on the Georgia and Tennessee courts (who ultimately ruled
against gay marriage in recent weeks on narrower, more technical,
terms). Nobody will excoriate you in the op-ed pages. Instead of
causing widespread fury, you will unleash, at most, widespread&nbsp;res&shy;ig&shy;na&shy;tion.</p>
<p>Still, you feel bad. You hold no personal animus toward gay people. You
even think there is something slightly mean-spirited behind your
state&#8217;s Defense of Marriage Act. You talk it over with your
wife/husband/clerks. It&#8217;s a pickle. Months&nbsp;pass.</p>
<p>Until you hit upon the solution: Shift the blame. Make the leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;ture
the bad guys. Find a way to frame the ban on gay marriage that makes it
impossible to strike down. Rule that unless the ban is utterly insane,
it&#8217;s con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&shy;al. Suggest that as long as the leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;ture passed it,
it must be rational. Use the word &quot;def&shy;er&shy;en&shy;tial&quot; six&nbsp;times.</p>
<p>The key to appearing reasonable will be to vilify the dissenters.
You&#8217;ll want to use your majority opinion to emphasize that judges who
vote their &quot;personal views&quot; are behaving like &quot;leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;tors.&quot; Quote
liberal lion Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens for that
propo&shy;si&shy;tion. Then con&shy;dem&shy;n—with&shy;out quite using the words &quot;judicial
activist&quot;—the dissenters for having been &quot;un&shy;char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;ti&shy;cal&shy;ly … led to
depart sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant&shy;ly from the court&#8217;s limited role when deciding
con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&shy;al&nbsp;challenges.&quot;</p>
<p>Be sure to tell your &quot;readers unfamiliar with appellate court review&quot;
that your state&#8217;s decision to ban gay marriage is solely the fault of
the leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;ture. Because you yourself, of course, still love&nbsp;everyone.</p>
