    <p>I often complain about being busy, no doubt because I have a talent for
com&shy;pli&shy;cat&shy;ing my life. Things were relatively quiet for a while, but that’s
not true anymore.</p>
<p>At work, we’re close to releasing the first version of our product.
Happily, crunch time at Atlas isn’t nearly as bad as it was at Microsoft.
Instead of working eight-ish hours a day, it’s more like nine or maybe ten.
The pressure level has risen, of course, but it’s far from in&shy;tol&shy;er&shy;a&shy;ble.</p>
<p>The real busyness is in my ex&shy;tracur&shy;ric&shy;u&shy;lar life. I’m the president of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.BiNetSeattle.org">BiNet Seattle</a>, a bisexual community group,
and have been for the last three years. I also do a hell of a lot of the
work and I’m burning out.
I recently gave notice that I’m stepping down. (It looks like a successor has been
found.) Meanwhile, a lot of planning is going on in an effort to revitalize
BiNet, as attendance has been dragging.</p>
<p>For the last few years, I’ve also been heavily involved with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.WildGeeseSeattle.org">The Wild Geese Players of Seattle</a>,
as the webmaster and the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/06/16/XMLScriptsForTheTheatre.html">co-dramaturge</a>.
We do readings of Irish literature, par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly that of
James Joyce and W.B.-Yeats. Every June 16th (Bloomsday), we do a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.WildGeeseSeattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/">staged reading</a>
of a chapter of <em>Ulysses</em>. This year, the longtime director
has moved back to Northern Ireland. Currently, I am acting as the director,
on top of my other roles, but I don’t think I’m the right person for the job,
and I’m hoping to find a re&shy;place&shy;ment soon.</p>
<p>I’m a member of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freelyspeaking.org/">Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters</a>, an <span class="caps">LGBT</span> speaking club.
I’ve been working on my
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.freelyspeaking.org/speeches1.htm"><span class="caps">CTM</span></a> for far
too long, and I intend to knock off the final three speeches this year.</p>
<p>I resume my wood&shy;work&shy;ing class next week, which is going to tie up ten
Tuesday evenings. I haven’t decided yet what I’m going to work on this
time. In previous years, I built a very nice set of nesting tables and
an un&shy;sat&shy;is&shy;fac&shy;to&shy;ry pair of bar stools.</p>
<p>In my Copious Spare Time, I’m also making occasional con&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tions
to two open source projects, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dasblog.info">DasBlog</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a>.
I made Vim <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/01/22/CompilingVimWithVisualC2003Toolkit.html">compile with <span class="caps">VC5</span>-<span class="caps">VC8</span></a>,
and I promised Bram that I would provide some doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion on
debugging Vim with WinDbg and dealing with minidumps.
I’d also like to produce a native Win64 version.
With DasBlog, I’ve provided some
<a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/02/10/UsabilityTestingDasBlogInstallation.html">feedback on the usability of the in&shy;stal&shy;la&shy;tion in&shy;struc&shy;tions</a>,
as well as a fix for <a class="reference external" href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;atid=709018&amp;aid=1357799&amp;group_id=127624">dodgy permalinks</a>.
I’d also like to make use of my former expertise on <span class="caps">IIS</span> per&shy;for&shy;mance
(see <a class="reference external" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/server/asp/asptips.asp">25+ Tips</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/server/iis/tencom.asp">10 Com&shy;mand&shy;ments</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/technologies/iis/maintain/optimize/iis5tune.mspx"><span class="caps">IIS</span> 5 Tuning</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1861002610/georgvreill-20">Pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al <span class="caps">ASP</span> 3.0</a>)
to do some per&shy;for&shy;mance tuning of DasBlog.</p>
<p>I’d also like to fit in some time for pho&shy;tog&shy;ra&shy;phy;
for reading my way through our enormous backlog of books and magazines;
writing the occasional blog post; cooking; bicycle riding;
traveling; working out; hanging out with my wife;
so&shy;cial&shy;iz&shy;ing with my friends; movies; and more.
Not to mention all the very dull projects around the house
and garden that I’ve neglected.</p>
