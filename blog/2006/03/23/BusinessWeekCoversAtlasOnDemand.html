<a class="reference external" href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/news/releases/20050523">Atlas On Demand</a>,
the product that I’ve worked on for the last six months, in a piece called
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.businessweek.com/@@nKnqf4YQDhFL8B0A/magazine/content/06_13/b3977404.htm"><span class="caps">TV</span> Eyeballs Close-Up</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever since the advent of commercial television, ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ers have
wondered exactly what they get for the megabucks they spend on
30-second spots. After all, the networks and cable companies offer only
a crude ap&shy;prox&shy;i&shy;ma&shy;tion of who is watching what. With such thin
in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion, ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ers can’t target specific neigh&shy;bor&shy;hoods or
consumer tastes. As for converting ads directly to sales, well, that’s
virtually impossible. Yet the Web, with its so&shy;phis&shy;ti&shy;cat&shy;ed per-click
metrics, does all of that billions of times a day. "The problem," says
Yankee Group analyst Aditya Kishore, "is that there’s not enough math
in [the <span class="caps">TV</span>] business."</p>
<p>But aQuantive Inc. (<span class="caps">AQNT</span> ) aims to change that. …
Despite the hoopla about ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ers moving online, the $70 billion
television ad market dwarfs the Web business 5 to 1. Says aQuantive <span class="caps">CEO</span>
Brian P. McAndrews, once an <span class="caps">ABC</span> executive: "<span class="caps">TV</span> is the largest medium
out there."</p>
<p>…-</p>
<p>That’s why aQuantive is taking baby steps. Starting in June, the
company’s Atlas on Demand unit will begin testing technology that
measures video-on-demand (<span class="caps">VOD</span>) viewers for Charter Com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tions Inc.
(<span class="caps">CHTR</span> ) <span class="caps">VOD</span>’s Web-like in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tiv&shy;i&shy;ty is what sold aQuantive. Besides,
the medium is taking off, with digital cable now in 25 million homes,
far ahead of TiVo’s 4.4 million.</p>
<p>By gathering data from the same set-top boxes viewers use to order
shows and movies, Atlas on Demand plans to figure out how many people
watched a show and when, as well as how many watched the ads vs.
skipped them. From there, company executives hope to help ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ers
determine precisely how much attention their money buys. "You know
people watch Lost," says John Chandler, Atlas on Demand senior analyst.
"[Now] you’ll know if they watch the ad."</p>
<p>…-</p>
<p>Proponents of <span class="caps">VOD</span> hope the medium will become as in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tive as the Web
itself, allowing viewers to get discount offers, enter contests, and
even buy stuff. Burger King is con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;ing running ads offering
drive-through deals to late-night <span class="caps">VOD</span> viewers. Such ads could be priced
based on the number of leads or sales they generate rather than the
number of viewers they attract. "The in&shy;ter&shy;sec&shy;tion of video on demand
and in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tive <span class="caps">TV</span> is the next frontier," says Time Warner Cable (<span class="caps">TWX</span> )
Executive Vice-President Peter C. Stern. "I look for it to emerge in 2007."</p>
<p>…-</p>
<p>Despite myriad challenges, the cable guys have little choice but to
become more Web-like. Every other day, it seems, marks the launch of
yet another ad-supported online channel. Karl Siebrecht, Atlas’ general
manager, bets Web video will become a major ad market sooner than <span class="caps">VOD</span>,
but he says on-demand <span class="caps">TV</span> eventually will be bigger. He and the other
Atlas folks don’t care whether the next great video market is <span class="caps">TV</span> or the
Web. They plan to make money either way.</p>
