    <p>I just saw Mozart&#8217;s <em>Così Fan Tutte</em> at the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattleopera.org/">Seattle Opera</a>.
I had a great time. Lots of fun. Well acted.
Great music. And a modern dress production that&nbsp;works.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosi_Fan_Tutte">The plot</a>,
in case you&#8217;re unfamiliar, involves fiancée swapping.
Two officers, Ferrando and Guglielmo, accept a bet from Don Alfonso
that their fiancées, Dorabella and Fiordiligi, are fickle and will
easily betray them. They pretend to go off to war, then disguise
themselves and each woos the other&#8217;s fiancée under false pretences.
Don Alfonso, along with Despina, the sisters&#8217; personal assistant (maid) sows mischief.
Dorabella, the flirt, wears down quickly.
Fiordiligi is tougher, but eventually yields.
Ostensibly a comedy, by the end, everyone has been hurt.
The three men are shits and deserve what they get; the sisters do&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattleopera.org/operas/2005-2006/cosi/interview.aspx">interview in the program with Jonathon Miller</a>,
the legendary English director, who&#8217;s re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;ble for this&nbsp;production.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">JM</span>: &#8230; It’s not even about fidelity, which is what most people think it’s
about, it’s about identity. It’s about people. You see, feminists often
object to the opera because it depicts the women as gullible and
foolish; but the fact is that the men are much more deceived than the
women are. The most dangerous thing is to get into disguise in the
belief that your original identity is invisible. What happens, of
course, is that you actually bring to life aspects of your identity
which you didn’t suspect. And I think that’s what happens here. It’s
very dangerous for a man—or anyone—to disguise themselves because, in
addition to deceiving the person who in fact you intend to deceive, you
actually find that you’re behaving in ways which you wouldn’t normally
behave if you thought your identity was&nbsp;apparent.</p>
<p><span class="caps">EH</span>: So you’re letting a little too much of the beast out, as it&nbsp;were.</p>
<p><span class="caps">JM</span>: Well not so much “the beast;” but all sorts of al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tive versions
of yourself which you didn’t suspect come into existence. I was partly
inspired by a novel which my mother, a very successful English novelist
[Betty Spiro Miller], wrote after the war about the experience of being
an officer’s wife. My father was a medical officer. She noticed that as
soon as all of his colleagues got into uniform, they suddenly started
to misbehave in a way which they wouldn’t have done if they were in
their pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al civilian clothes. They somehow felt that they were
not rec&shy;og&shy;niz&shy;able and therefore not&nbsp;culpable.</p>
<p>That’s one of the reasons why people get into disguise at masked balls.
It allows them to be someone else. It lets out an al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tive version
of your&shy;self—not nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;i&shy;ly a beast, but something that you didn’t&nbsp;expect.</p>
