    <p>I was born 41 years ago today. (Tech&shy;ni&shy;cal&shy;ly, yesterday, as it's now the early hours
of March 16th.) I was to have been called Vincent after my father, but my mother's
father, George Victor Clery, had died just 12 days before. I was baptised
George Vincent Reilly on March 17th, St. Patrick's Day.</p>
<p>Beware the Ides of March, I tell people: You might have to buy George a present.
Better a birthday present than the reception that Julius Caesar received on
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_Of_March">March 15th, 44BC</a>.</p>
<p>I've never liked the name George all that much, but I've never disliked it
enough to do anything about it. (Emma legally changed her entire name about ten years
ago.) &quot;George&quot; has the advantage that it's largely gone out of fashion, but
everyone recognizes it. How many Jeffs and Mikes and Scotts do you know?
And how many Georges?</p>
<p>I realized over dinner with Emma that 15 years ago today, I took a momentous step:
<a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.motss/browse_thread/thread/baf274ae585ab622/330d866060d756d8">I came out as bisexual</a>.
It scared the hell out of me at the time. It hasn't always been easy.
But it was definitely the right thing to do.</p>
