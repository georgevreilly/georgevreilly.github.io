<p>30 years ago today, I sat down at a computer for the first time,
and I wrote my first&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>I was in Fifth Year of secondary school in Ire&shy;land—the equivalent of eleventh grade.
Personal computers were just coming into Ireland;
few people had them.
I had been taking an ex&shy;tracur&shy;ric&shy;u&shy;lar course in computer pro&shy;gram&shy;ming,
in the school&#8217;s physics lab.
We wrote code on paper at our desks, as there were no computers in the room.
Somehow, I hadn&#8217;t realized that there was another room with computers,
in a normally off-limits part of the school, until late&nbsp;January.</p>
<p>Once I sat down at a computer, I was hooked.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="caps">PRINT</span> 2+2</tt>? <tt class="docutils literal">4</tt>!
Writing code on paper was boring.
This thing was&nbsp;fun!</p>
<p>There were five Apple ][s in that room and eight regulars, if I remember correctly.
I spent a lot of time after school in that room over the next few months.
I became com&shy;fort&shy;able with AppleSoft <span class="caps">BASIC</span>
and I wrote some sloppy 6502 assembly language.
(Over the next seven years, I wrote a lot of very tight 6502&nbsp;code.)</p>
<p>Up to that point, I had some vague notion that I wanted to be a scientist.
Now I knew I wanted to work with&nbsp;computers.</p>
<p>That year, I got my first summer job so that I could buy a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro"><span class="caps">BBC</span> Micro</a>.
I worked as a car park (parking lot) attendant at a su&shy;per&shy;mar&shy;ket,
standing out in the rain all day long,
charging customers for the privilege of parking while buying groceries.
It was so traumatic that I&#8217;ve never had a non-computer job since—and only the following summer&#8217;s job required no pro&shy;gram&shy;ming&nbsp;skill.</p>
<p>I finished secondary school in 1983 and applied, suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly,
to study Computer Science at Trinity College Dublin.
I had a part-time job over the next five years,
writing software for <span class="caps">RT</span>É, the Irish national <span class="caps">TV</span> station.
I had one full-time job in Ireland.
I came to the States in 1989 and got a Masters in Computers Science at Brown.
I moved to Seattle in 1992 to work for Microsoft.
I left Microsoft the following year, though I later went back.
I&#8217;ve spent the last 20 years in the Seattle software&nbsp;industry.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written a lot of code over the last 30 years.
I still get a thrill out of creating elegant software.
I&#8217;ve written code that&#8217;s shipped on every Windows box in the last decade—<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/a2a45c42-38bc-464c-a097-d7a202092a54.mspx">http.sys</a> is available from Windows <span class="caps">XP</span> Service Pack 3 on&shy;ward&shy;s—and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> comes with every Linux and&nbsp;Mac.</p>
<p>I had no idea that day that I had changed my life, that I had found my&nbsp;vocation.</p>
