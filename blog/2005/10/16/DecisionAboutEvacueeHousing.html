<div class="line">From:   Emma Bartholomew</div>
</div>
<p>Hello&nbsp;all,</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has assisted George <span class="amp">&amp;</span> me in our attempt to
ready our home for hurricane&nbsp;evacuees.</p>
<p>Re&shy;gret&shy;tably, I have come to realize that I&#8217;m not emo&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly able to
make this commitment after all.  I thought I could open my home to
others, but I have sunk into a depression over the past few weeks that
has finally convinced me that I tried to bite off more than I could&nbsp;chew.</p>
<p>George <span class="amp">&amp;</span> I are still committed to helping evacuees, but we will now be
doing this through donations of time and money to a local group,
Katrina Housing Northwest <a class="reference external" href="http://www.katrinahousingNW.org">www.ka&shy;tri&shy;na&shy;hous&shy;ingNW.org</a> I have attached the latest Katrina
Housing Seattle Alert to the end of this message so you can get an idea
of what the group is presently&nbsp;doing.</p>
<p>We will be re&shy;im&shy;burs&shy;ing those who gave us cash donations and having a
party to thank those of you who gave of your time and effort.  Thank you
again for all your hard work on our&nbsp;behalf.</p>
<p>Warmest regards,&nbsp;Emma</p>
<p><span class="caps">PS</span> from&nbsp;George.</p>
<p>This hasn&#8217;t been an easy time for Emma and I know she feels that she&#8217;s
let you (and herself) down. I wish that matters had worked out
otherwise. I thank all of you who selflessly gave of your time and
money. It was inspiring to both of&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>/George</p>

<p>Hello <span class="caps">KHNW</span>&nbsp;supporters!</p>
<p>This past Thursday a meeting was held in downtown Seattle with
Rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives from the American Red Cross, The Emergency Management
Division, The Seattle Housing Authority and many community
or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tions, and private ones such as ours.
A rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tive kept us informed of the meetings&nbsp;results:</p>
<p><em>The Goal:</em> To com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cate the Housing Sus&shy;tain&shy;ment Plan for the over
1000 evacuees in our area right now. Specif&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly, funding and
avail&shy;abil&shy;i&shy;ty of <span class="caps">LONG</span> <span class="caps">TERM</span> <span class="caps">PERMANENT</span> <span class="caps">HOUSING</span> in their own&nbsp;homes.</p>
<p><em>The Answer:</em> They have not arrived at an answer&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p>True, that is frus&shy;trat&shy;ing, and I could spend plenty of time venting
about the details of the lack of planning, or the level of frus&shy;tra&shy;tion
my families and many others have ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced.
<em>However</em>, the <em>immediate needs of our evacuees</em> still remain, and <em>our
mission is to meet those needs</em>.
Wherever and however we can. I am thoroughly committed to&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>The good news for us is that I have partnered with Rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives from
the American Red Cross King/Kitsap/Olympia chapters to help identify
individual needs, and we are working directly with the In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al
Rescue Committee ( <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theirc.org/">www.theirc.org</a>) who are
excellent allies in the progress towards <span class="caps">KHNW</span> being successful in their
mission to&nbsp;assist.</p>
<p>We are fortunate that we get to skip the red tape in all this. We are
fueled entirely on the kindness of our local supporters. You have all
been a key part of improving the lives of these&nbsp;people!</p>
<p>We still have needs for these families and our or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tion. Those needs&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Private housing for 12-18 months (evacuee family only) i.e empty
apartments in Seattle area,  (services are in the city and they need to
be&nbsp;close)</li>
<li><span class="caps">GIFT</span> <span class="caps">CARDS</span>: For Target, Fred Meyer, Safeway, <span class="caps">QFC</span>, <span class="caps">WALGREEN</span>&#8217;S, Sears,
Ikea, Rite Aid, Office Max, <span class="caps">COSTCO</span> for household items,&nbsp;etc&#8230;</li>
<li><span class="caps">GAS</span> <span class="caps">CARDS</span>: For our volunteer drivers who are burning through the fuel
to drive these folks around until they get bus passes, cars&nbsp;etc&#8230;</li>
<li>A Tax Attorney to offer pro-bono time to assist with the 501c (3)
status&nbsp;filing.</li>
<li>A <span class="caps">PT</span> Non Profit Accountant,&nbsp;volunteer</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in any of these items, just email me at
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:nhnorthwest@gmail.com">nhnorth&shy;west&#64;gmail.com</a> and/or
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:northwestRR@gmail.com">north&shy;westRR&#64;gmail.com</a> (that is Jessica&#8217;s
email, our amazing admin)
Want to get a group involved? Please organize support through your
office, schools, places of worship, etc&#8230; we can provide you with
posters/flyer&#8217;s&nbsp;etc&#8230;!</p>
<p>This continues to be a very important and in&shy;creas&shy;ing&shy;ly more organized
effort. We have surpassed the point where we only co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nat&shy;ed short term
emergency housing, and now we are in it for the long haul, providing
solutions for many&nbsp;needs.</p>
<p><em>Thank you <span class="caps">ALL</span></em> so very very much for your kindness, support, assistance
and generosity. I never know how to express enough how much it means to
me, and all the people you help, that you have done so much in such
dis&shy;tress&shy;ing times for&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Truly,</p>

<p>We received some very touching, un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing responses from our friends,
often ac&shy;knowl&shy;edg&shy;ing their own struggles with depression, and thanking
us for doing what we had so&nbsp;far.</p>
<p>As for the basement, Chuck came over this morning and helped me frame out
the 11-foot opening. The carpet layers are coming in at the end of the
week, and I expect the window people to come next&nbsp;week.</p>
