    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi</a>.
Vee-eye. My text editor of choice for 20 years. Half my life.</p>
<p>Why? Because I
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_imprinting">imprinted</a>
on vi, like a duckling on its mother.
Vi's keystrokes are bound into my
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory">muscle memory</a>.
My fingers re&shy;flex&shy;ive&shy;ly use vi keystrokes to move around,
to delete text, to move blocks, to find patterns.
I don't have to think about using <tt class="docutils literal">dw</tt> to delete a word,
or <tt class="docutils literal">n</tt> to find the next match of a pattern,
or <tt class="docutils literal">yG</tt> to yank the rest of a file,
or <tt class="docutils literal">j</tt> to move down a line,
or <tt class="docutils literal">.</tt> to repeat the last mod&shy;i&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion.
My sub&shy;con&shy;cious does it for me.</p>
<p>I don't even have to think much about more complex commands,
like <tt class="docutils literal">ct)</tt> to replace a parameter list,
or simpler regexp re&shy;place&shy;ments.
I've in&shy;ter&shy;nal&shy;ized so many vi idioms in the last two decades.</p>
<p>For nearly all editing tasks, I'm far more productive when I use vi.
Like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.oreilly.com/news/zenclavier_1299.html">Tom Chris&shy;tiansen</a>,
I can become at one with the machine.</p>
<p>People who've used
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi</a>
fall into a bimodal dis&shy;tri&shy;b&shy;u&shy;tion.
They love it or they hate it.
Usually, it's because of vi's
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_%28computer_interface%29">modal</a>
nature.
I love the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/2005_06.html">or&shy;thog&shy;o&shy;nal&shy;i&shy;ty</a>
of the UI.</p>

<h2>20 years</h2>
<p>In the autumn of 1985, I entered my third year
of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/">Computer Science at Trinity</a>.
We were promoted from three hours a day on the 1200-baud terminals
in the basement to all-day usage of the 9600-baud terminals in the
main terminal room.
We also graduated from the wretched
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/jargon.html#SOS">SOS</a> line editor
to vi running on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunice_%28software%29">Eunice</a>
(a Unix emulator for VAX/VMS).
I don't think I took to vi instantly;
it took a little while for it to grow on me.
Soon enough, though, I was hooked on
<a class="reference external" href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/R/regexp.html">regexps</a>.</p>
<p>Hitting ESC quickly became a habit:
one that causes me occasional grief,
when I re&shy;flex&shy;ive&shy;ly hit ESC after entering text in an edit field
in some app or other, and destroy what I've just written.</p>
<p>Two years later, I got my first fulltime job,
writing a full-screen text editor for a small Irish type&shy;set&shy;ting company,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.icpc.ie/">ICPC</a>. It was a re&shy;place&shy;ment for the in-house
line-based editor used by the data entry keyboaders,
which I wrote in Vax Pascal.
A friend made me aware of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=gregg+wonderly+vitpu">VITPU</a>,
a Vi emulator written in VMS's TPU,
which I gladly latched onto.</p>
<p>Two years after that, I entered the Master's program at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/">Brown</a>,
where I first got to use Unix and X Windows.
Naturally, I used vi, but it was a lot less powerful than
GNU Emacs, which was very popular.
In time, I learned of VIP, a vi emulator for Emacs.
I began using VIP and quickly forsook standard vi.
I liked having the power and cus&shy;tomiz&shy;abil&shy;i&shy;ty of Emacs,
though I never learned to like the Emacs key&shy;bind&shy;ings.
(Fran√ßois Pinard, a longtime Emacs user, writes eloquently of why he
<a class="reference external" href="http://pinard.progiciels-bpi.ca/opinions/editors.html">moved to Vim</a>.)</p>
<p>I stayed with VIP for years, as it evolved into
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~kifer/emacs.html">Viper</a>.
I show up in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/emacs/viper_49.html">Viper credits</a>
for occasional con&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tions.</p>
<p>In 1992, I moved to Seattle and worked for Microsoft for the first time.
I kept my Emacs+Viper habit.</p>
<p>By 1995, I was working for Mi&shy;cro&shy;Crafts and had discovered
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. Version-3.x ran on DOS as a 16-bit
command-line app. I used it oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly on NT. Then I discovered that
Roger Knobbe had ported Vim to NT, but that it was pretty buggy.
I fixed the bugs and submitted my fixes to
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moolenaar.net/">Bram Moolenaar</a>, Vim's author.</p>
<p>One thing led to another, and I became the Win32 guy for Vim-4.x.
Console-mode Vim became rock solid on NT 4, but I never got it to the same
level on Win95, due to inherent problems in the console APIs on Win9x.
I also put together a proof-of-concept im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion of gvim-5.0 for Windows.
At that point, I gave up active in&shy;volve&shy;ment in the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of Vim:
I had moved back to Microsoft, I was starting to date Emma,
and I was working on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://george.reilly.org/BegAtlCom.html">Beginning ATL COM Pro&shy;gram&shy;ming book</a>.
Something had to give.</p>
<p>I continued using Viper for much of the time that I was developing Vim,
because Vim was not then rich enough for my needs.
After Vim got a scripting language (VimL) and syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing in
version-5, I started using Vim more and more.
I think it's been five years since I last used Emacs,
and I never got beyond GNU Emacs-19.34.</p>
<p>Recently, I've stopped using Vim as my exclusive pro&shy;gram&shy;ming editor,
and I've been al&shy;ter&shy;nat&shy;ing between Vim and Visual Studio plus
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">Resharper</a>,
as I've started doing a lot of .NET de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment.
But more on that some other time. This post is already too long.</p>
