    <p>On Saturday 10th September 2005, over 8,000 people will par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pate in
the Northwest <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Foundation Walk. I will be one of them, as I have
been every year since 1992.</p>
<p>To sponsor me, please visit my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aidswalk2005.org/site/TR?px=1013411&amp;pg=personal&amp;fr_id=1050">Donation Page</a>.</p>
<p>I had originally signed up to march with Team Microsoft.
Then we in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.binetseattle.org/">BiNet Seattle</a> decided to form a team.
Please join <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aidswalk2005.org/site/TR?pg=team&amp;fr_id=1050&amp;team_id=3120">Team BiNet Seattle</a>: we’d love to have you.</p>
<p>It’s been more than 20 years since <span class="caps">AIDS</span> was first recognized. <span class="caps">AIDS</span> is
still wreaking dev&shy;as&shy;ta&shy;tion in Africa and Asia, and affecting many in the
<span class="caps">U.S.</span> Although the new protease inhibitors are helping many people in
the West, the <span class="caps">AIDS</span> epidemic is far from over. For one thing, the new
drugs are not a cure. When they work well, they enable people with <span class="caps">AIDS</span>
to lead an active life and live much longer than before. But one-third
of people with access to medical treatment do not respond to that
treatment. The new drugs are hor&shy;ren&shy;dous&shy;ly expensive (about $15,000 per
year), so they’re out of reach of 95% of the people living with <span class="caps">AIDS</span>
around the world. (Recently, the large phar&shy;ma&shy;ceu&shy;ti&shy;cal companies have
come to some agreements to make their drugs available at much cheaper
rates in the Third World, but millions of people still have no access to
the drugs.) Fur&shy;ther&shy;more, somewhere between 550 and 1,100 Wash&shy;ing&shy;to&shy;ni&shy;ans
are infected every year, one-quarter of them under the age of 22. More
than 85% of the people diagnosed with <span class="caps">AIDS</span> in Washington State since
1995 are still alive—a marked im&shy;prove&shy;ment on the situation before the
protease inhibitors became available. All of this means that there’s a
continuing need for money to help fight the epidemic.</p>
<p>In addition to funding the Lifelong <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Alliance’s own services, the
money raised will be dis&shy;trib&shy;uted to other <span class="caps">AIDS</span> or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tions throughout
Washington State. The Lifelong <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Alliance (formerly the Northwest
<span class="caps">AIDS</span> Foundation and the Chicken Soup Brigade) provides a variety of
services to <span class="caps">HIV</span>+ people and people living with <span class="caps">AIDS</span> in Washington: Food,
housing, rent subsidies, in-home care, groceries, ed&shy;u&shy;ca&shy;tion&shy;al material,
and much more.  See <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lifelongaidsalliance.org">http://www.life&shy;lon&shy;gaid&shy;sal&shy;liance.org</a> for more details.</p>
<p>If you’d like to walk yourself, please visit
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.aidswalk2005.org">http://www.aidswalk2005.org</a>. If you work for a company, such as
Microsoft, that matches charitable con&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tions, be sure to list your
company name.</p>
<p>I thank you, Lifelong <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Alliance thanks you, and the people your
donation will help thank you.</p>
