    <p>Two weeks ago, I completed a year as a contractor at Microsoft.
After the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permatemp">permatemps lawsuits</a>,
no contractor may work more than 12 months at Microsoft without taking a 100-day break.
(Con&shy;trac&shy;tors are free to work elsewhere, of course, during the&nbsp;break.)</p>
<p>Emma quit her job at washington Mutual the same week
in order to set up <a class="reference external" href="http://www.TheWheel.biz">her own business</a>.
It will be months before she starts making money,
so it seemed prudent for me to find a full-time&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>Last week, I in&shy;ter&shy;viewed with Amazon.
This week, I in&shy;ter&shy;viewed with
the group at Microsoft that I just left, Atlas <span class="caps">DMT</span>, and&nbsp;Google.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Atlas both made very attractive offers.
This afternoon, I accepted the position of Senior Software Engineer at&nbsp;Atlas.</p>
<p>I had a very good year at Microsoft in Windows Emerging Markets.
I did some really in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing work on an as-yet unan&shy;nounced product
(some day I hope to be able to talk about what I did)
and I worked on a first-class team.
I have two longtime friends on the team, Muhsin and Delf,
and the three of us became very close to my officemate, Dipankar.
Dipankar&#8217;s contract ends next week;
he received two offers of fulltime jobs from Microsoft this week,
and he&#8217;s accepted the position on the codec&nbsp;team.</p>
<p>While I very much liked the team and the product,
I&#8217;m not nearly so keen on Microsoft the company.
Between full-time employment and contracts,
I&#8217;ve spent almost 10 out of the last 13 years at Microsoft,
and that&#8217;s more than enough.
(It seems mildly ironic to be writing this on the day of the annual Microsoft Company Meeting,
cel&shy;e&shy;brat&shy;ing Microsoft&#8217;s 30th&nbsp;an&shy;niver&shy;sary.)</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.AtlasSolutions.com">Atlas</a> is a technology company, spe&shy;cial&shy;iz&shy;ing in web ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ing.
I&#8217;m joining a team that&#8217;s working on ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ing in video-on-demand.
I was very impressed by the team when I in&shy;ter&shy;viewed there on Wednesday,
and they liked me too.
They were a sharp bunch of guys
who conducted a well-balanced series of interview
that was both testing and&nbsp;welcoming.</p>
<p>The team has been using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.controlchaos.com/">Scrum</a> for a while
and they&#8217;ve migrated towards <a class="reference external" href="http://www.xprogramming.com/"><span class="caps">XP</span></a>, which they speak highly of.
I&#8217;ve wanted to get first-hand experience in Agile de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment for years.
They&#8217;re also using C# and .<span class="caps">NET</span>.
After 15 years of C and C++, I&#8217;m ready for managed code.
They seem to be very committed to work/life balance.
Not least, they&#8217;re in the In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al District of downtown Seattle,
3 miles from my house.
Every job I&#8217;ve had in my 13 years of living here
has required me to commute across Lake&nbsp;Washington.</p>
