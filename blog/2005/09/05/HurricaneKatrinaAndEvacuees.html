    <p>A few hours ago, Emma sent this email out to our&nbsp;friends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After long thought and a lot of heart searching, George <span class="amp">&amp;</span> I have decided to
take in a family from Louisiana.  We are now starting to look for someone
who can help us make arrange&shy;ments to get people here. Meanwhile, we need
anyone who wants to volunteer to help us clean out our basement and fix it
up to house people.  We have a guest room on our first floor, but we also
need to rearrange the entire house to allow us to add 4-6 people to our
lives for up to the next&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>At the very least, we need anyone who can donate money to help with travel
costs for the family we get, to buy supplies to make our basement livable,
to donate beds/bunk beds and other bedroom furniture (tho&#8217; this can wait on
when we know the make up of the family we get),  etc. Whatever family we
get is going to became part of our family.  We don&#8217;t want them to feel like
refugees being tolerated in our home in make-shift conditions, we want them
to feel like <span class="caps">FAMILY</span> and that our home is their&nbsp;<span class="caps">HOME</span>.</p>
<p>If any of you have contact with a poor family that needs a new start,
please let us know.  We&#8217;ll be looking for a way to get a family&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>Blessings,
Emma Bartholomew <span class="amp">&amp;</span> George&nbsp;Reilly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was Emma&#8217;s idea. I&#8217;ve always known that she had a big heart.
I&#8217;m par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly proud of her this&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>She later sent this&nbsp;out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for everyone&#8217;s responses so far.  George <span class="amp">&amp;</span> I have contacted various
groups about providing housing and are waiting to hear back. Meanwhile,
we&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that we need to get some pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;als in here
to bring our basement up-to-code for housing a family.  Does anyone know of
a reputable contractor/firm that we could hire to do the work?  With a
good, fast firm, we can add two to three bedrooms with escape windows to
our basement, while upgrading the basement bathroom to be able to handle
the additional&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>Thanks for any&nbsp;sug&shy;ges&shy;tions.</p>
<p>Emma <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;George</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be a busy few days around here. We have a lot of
crap that we need to shift&nbsp;around.</p>
