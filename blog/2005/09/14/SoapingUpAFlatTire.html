    <p>I learned a really clever trick at our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2005/09/14/KatrinaEvacueesWorkPartiesAndScalingBack.aspx">workparty</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p>We were using a dolly that we had borrowed from our neighbor Mary
to haul a heavy credenza up from the basement.
One of the tires was flat, which made the exercise even more difficult.</p>
<p>I got out my bicycle floor pump and started pumping,
but it was a waste of time.
The tire was tubeless and without any air,
so it just slipped loosely around the rim.
After a few minutes of futility,
Dale remembered something he had seen years before at a gas station.</p>
<p>He got a bowl of soapy water and a sponge,
and coated the metal rim and both rims of the tire with soapy water.
This created a film which held the air in.
Once there was a little air inside the tire,
it started inflating when I pumped
and the rim of the tire pushed against the metal rim, creating an airtight seal.
After that, it was only a minute's work to bring the tire up to the rec&shy;om&shy;mend&shy;ed 30psi.</p>
