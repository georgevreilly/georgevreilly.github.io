    <p>Last Wednesday night, Emma emailed a dozen of our friends,
inviting them to join us for Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing dinner.
One reply arrived the next morning. Then nothing.</p>
<p>By Sunday evening, I had grown ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ed enough
to send out a snarky followup:</p>
<blockquote>
The courtesy of a belated reply would be ap&shy;pre&shy;ci&shy;at&shy;ed.
So far, we've got exactly one RSVP.</blockquote>
<p>It served its purpose. Replies cascaded in. Most, alas, said &quot;no&quot;;
they had other plans.</p>
<p>Would that this were an isolated incident.
Time and again, I've issued in&shy;vi&shy;ta&shy;tions that were not responded to.
A simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; is ideal.
A &quot;maybe&quot; is acceptable too,
especially if you follow up with a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p>RSVP is not a mean&shy;ing&shy;less formality. It's a vital planning aid.
I need to know ahead of time whether to expect three or thirteen
for a dinner party. It's rude and thought&shy;less to leave me hanging in limbo.
If I assume that everyone who's been invited will show up,
and cater ac&shy;cord&shy;ing&shy;ly, and many of them don't come,
I've gone to needless expense and effort.
If I guess that only half those invited will turn up, and I un&shy;der&shy;es&shy;ti&shy;mate,
then I'm em&shy;bar&shy;rassed by not being able to feed my guests properly.</p>
<p>It's almost as big a sin for you to say &quot;yes&quot;,
then fail to show, without a word of warning.</p>
<p>When the stakes are low, such as a large drinks party,
the lack of RSVPs is a minor matter.
For a major production, it's in&shy;con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;ate at best.</p>
