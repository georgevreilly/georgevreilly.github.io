    <p>On Saturday, I bought <em>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</em>
at CostCo. On leaving, the checker told me that I had bought the
887th copy at the store. This was 1pm, three hours after opening,
so they were selling at the rate of five per&nbsp;minute.</p>
<p>I started reading it last night. After two chapters,
when I had seen far too many references to earlier books
that I didn&#8217;t recall, I decided that it was time to
re-read the earlier books. I&#8217;m a fast reader, but I don&#8217;t
retain material very&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>In the first chapter of the first book, I came across
an ironically prophetic statement, made by Professor McGonagall
as she and Professor Dumbledore are leaving Baby Moses,
er, Harry on the Dursleys&#8217;s&nbsp;doorstep:</p>
<blockquote>
He&#8217;ll be famous &#8211; a legend &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised
if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future
&#8211; there will be books written about Harry
&#8211; every child in our world will know his name!</blockquote>
<p>This of course was written when <span class="caps">J.K.</span> Rowling was an unknown,
when the thought of her being a mil&shy;lion&shy;aire, much less a bil&shy;lion&shy;aire,
was&nbsp;un&shy;think&shy;able.</p>
