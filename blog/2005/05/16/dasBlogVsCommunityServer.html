    <p>I’ve set up a new personal blog at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/">www.georgevreil&shy;ly.com/blog</a>.
I’ll be posting non-technical stuff there
and I’ll be cross-posting on technical matters to Weblogs @ <span class="caps">ASP</span>.net.
Here’s how I ended up running dasBlog on the new blog.</p>
<p>In the spring of last year, I attempted
to install both <a class="reference external" href="http://scottwater.com/blog">.Text</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/shanselman/dasblog">dasBlog</a> on my <span class="caps">XP</span> Pro laptop.
I failed, signally, to get either one working.
The details have mercifully faded with time,
leaving me only with a residue of frus&shy;tra&shy;tion.</p>
<p>I’ve been meaning to put some photos of mine up on the web for a while.
A week ago, I went to download <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ngallery.org/">nGallery</a>,
as I remembered hearing good things about it in the past.
I learned that nGallery is now part of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.communityserver.org/">Community Server</a> (as is .Text).
After navigating through the somewhat confusing portal,
I downloaded a copy of Community Server 1.0.</p>
<p>Then I spent several frus&shy;trat&shy;ing hours trying to get it running on my laptop.
Community Server requires a <span class="caps">SQL</span> Server back-end,
but you can also use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.asp.net/msde/default.aspx"><span class="caps">MSDE</span></a>, the standalone Microsoft <span class="caps">SQL</span> Desktop Engine,
which comes without a <span class="caps">GUI</span>.
I downloaded <span class="caps">MSDE</span> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=C039A798-C57A-419E-ACBC-2A332CB7F959&amp;displaylang=en"><span class="caps">SQL</span> Web Data Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tor</a>, as well as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.msde.biz/msdequery/download.htm"><span class="caps">MSDE</span> Query</a>.
I can spell "<span class="caps">SQL</span>", but that’s about where my knowledge of <span class="caps">SQL</span> stops.
I tried to follow the in&shy;struc&shy;tions to create the database tables.
I did manage to create the master table,
but I could not figure out how to set the various per&shy;mis&shy;sions that the in&shy;struc&shy;tions demanded.
I googled ex&shy;ten&shy;sive&shy;ly and looked through the archived forums
at Com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty&shy;Serv&shy;er.org and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sqljunkies.com/Forums/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=140">SqlJunkies.com</a>, to no avail.</p>
<p>Really!
If I can’t figure this stuff out,
most people are never going to get Community Server running on their own systems.
Don’t get me wrong.
Community Server/.Text is a good blogging system,
if you can surmount the barriers to entry.
I’m a competent, skilled developer,
but I’ve never needed to learn <span class="caps">SQL</span>,
and I wasn’t motivated enough to dig further.</p>
<p>(I’ve since realized that my hosting package at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ihostsites.net/">iHostSites</a>
includes MySql, but not <span class="caps">SQL</span> Server,
so this would have been all for naught.
I think.
Double aargh!)</p>
<p>I gave up on Community Server in frus&shy;tra&shy;tion, and decided to fall back to nGallery.
I got nGallery installed and running easily enough.
Alas, it was flaky and it was all too easy
to get <span class="caps">ASP</span>.net throwing unhandled exceptions back at me.
spend too much of my life trou&shy;bleshoot&shy;ing other people’s bugs,
and I wasn’t prepared to invest any more time on this avenue.</p>
<p>At this point, I googled for "web album software" and came up with <a class="reference external" href="http://jalbum.net/">JAlbum</a>.
I’m much happier with JAlbum.
It worked flawlessly as soon as I ran it and it’s versatile.
Photos will start appearing on my personal website, www.GeorgeVReil&shy;ly.com, soon.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I decided to give dasBlog another try.
That was altogether more successful.
I did not manage to get it running on my laptop,
but I did get it running on a <span class="caps">XP</span> Pro desktop system,
as well as on my public website.
did have a little difficulty getting it to run on my desktop system,
but that went away as soon as I ran asp&shy;net_regi&shy;is -i to reset <span class="caps">ASP</span>.net.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why it doesn’t run on my laptop,
but the enormous amount of stuff that I’ve installed on this system
surely plays a role.
Indeed that may have been the reason why nGallery puked on my laptop.
Someday, I’m going to have to flatten the system and reinstall only the important stuff.</p>
<p>Net results:</p>
<p>Album software: JAlbum 1, nGallery 0.</p>
<p>Blogging software: dasBlog 1, Community Server 0.</p>
