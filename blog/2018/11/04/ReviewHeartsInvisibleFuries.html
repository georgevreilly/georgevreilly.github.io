<p>[Spoilers&nbsp;below]</p>
<p>Cyril&#8217;s 16-year-old mother put him up for adoption in 1945,
months after she was forced out of her Cork village by the parish priest.
He grows up in an odd, well-off household in Dublin,
always being told by his adoptive father, Charles Avery,
that he&#8217;s not a <em>real</em> Avery.
At seven, he develops a fas&shy;ci&shy;na&shy;tion with Julian,
the son of his father&#8217;s lawyer, whom he meets one fateful day.
They meet again at fourteen, sharing a room in boarding school,
and Cyril develops a full-blown but entirely secret obsession with&nbsp;Julian.</p>
<p>Cyril begins to realize that he is that most despised creature,
a homosexual in 1950s Catholic Ireland.
By twenty-one, he is frequently meeting other men
for hurried, furtive, anonymous sex.
Homosexual acts are illegal in Ireland and discovery would mean ruination,
if not pros&shy;e&shy;cu&shy;tion.
He&#8217;s still secretly in love with Julian,
now a het&shy;ero&shy;sex&shy;u&shy;al hedonist in the swinging Sixties.
At twenty-eight, deeply conflicted, he marries Julian&#8217;s sister Alice,
and abandons her hours after the wedding.
By thirty-five (1980), he&#8217;s ended up in Amsterdam,
where gay people can live openly;
he starts a re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship with Bastiaan, a Dutch doctor.
In 1987, they&#8217;re in New York, working with dying <span class="caps">AIDS</span> patients.
One of them is Julian, from whom he belatedly learns
that Alice has a teenaged son, Liam.
Bastiaan is killed by fagbashers who leave Cyril with a&nbsp;limp.</p>
<p>After that, Cyril returns to Dublin,
where he lives openly if quietly as a gay man.
In 2015, Ireland has recently voted to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/23/gay-marriage-ireland-yes-vote">legalize same-sex marriage</a>,
and Cyril, now seventy, marvels at his own 17-year-old grandson
openly expressing affection for his boyfriend.
It&#8217;s a bit&shy;ter&shy;sweet moment for&nbsp;Cyril.</p>
