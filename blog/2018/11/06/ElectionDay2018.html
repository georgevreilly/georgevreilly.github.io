<p>In 2016, I threw an Election Night victory party for Hillary Clinton.
It turned into a&nbsp;wake.</p>
<p>In 2016, it was obvious to me and to millions of others
that Trump was unfit to be President.
There were weak excuses that he might turn out to be more pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial
after the campaign was over.
Instead, we got the worst president we&#8217;ve ever seen in the <span class="caps">US</span>.
Morally unfit.
Tem&shy;pera&shy;men&shy;tal&shy;ly unfit.
Ethically unfit.
A patho&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal liar.
A shatterer of alliances.
A demagogue, stoking the flames of right-wing violent&nbsp;extremism.</p>
<p>In 2018, there are no excuses for not seeing how dangerous Trump is.
Trump himself is not on the ballot,
but this is nonethe&shy;less a referendum on Trump.
The Republican party have done nothing to rein in his excesses.
They will continue to do nothing if they retain the House of&nbsp;Rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives.</p>
<p>The Re&shy;pub&shy;li&shy;cans must be voted out of power in the House.
The Senate too, if that&#8217;s possible.
Trump is deeply unpopular outside his base,
but structural in&shy;equal&shy;i&shy;ties, ger&shy;ry&shy;man&shy;der&shy;ing, and voter sup&shy;pres&shy;sion
all make it far from certain that the Democrats can win&nbsp;tonight.</p>
<p>Brace yourselves for a&nbsp;backlash.</p>
<p>If the Democrats win a narrow victory,
expect rage and violence from the right-wing
that dwarfs that of the last few weeks.
Trump has been laying down a narrative of a stolen election again,
just as he did before the 2016&nbsp;election.</p>
<p>If the Re&shy;pub&shy;li&shy;cans retain control,
what little restraint that was still in place will go.
They will not be mag&shy;nan&shy;i&shy;mous in&nbsp;victory.</p>
<p>We may not know the final results for weeks,
as tight races are counted and&nbsp;recounted.</p>
<p>The best outcome is for
the Democrats to win a resounding victory and sweep the House.
I don&#8217;t know if we can pull that off.
But the best way to be sure is for everyone
to <em>vote Democrat</em>&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>Please vote.
It&nbsp;matters.</p>
