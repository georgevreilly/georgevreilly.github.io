    <p>2018 was a mixed year for Emma and&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>At the start of the year,
I was the principal engineer at MetaBrite.
The year started out well initially,
as we had moved to much larger offices at the end of 2017.
In late January, a number of people were laid off,
when it became apparent
that the old business plan would no longer work.
In late March, the company died abruptly
when we lost our principal source of funding.
I spent April looking for a job and received several&nbsp;offers.</p>
<p>I joined <a class="reference external" href="https://www.stripe.com/">Stripe</a>&#8216;s Seattle office in June,
where I work on the Edge team,
which is &quot;ensuring Stripeâ€™s continued existence on the Internet&quot;.
It&#8217;s been a bit of adjustment going from being a big fish in a small pond
to at best a medium-sized fish in a much larger pond.
Stripe is growing rapidly in Seattle and we just moved to a new&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been active in Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters, continuing as an officer at my home club,
<a class="reference external" href="http://freelyspeaking.org/">Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters</a>.
We&#8217;ve struggled with finding new members.
After a couple of years in South Lake Union,
we have moved back to Capitol Hill.
In July, I became an Area Director,
re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;ble for several clubs in downtown&nbsp;Seattle.</p>
<p>In June, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/">Wild Geese Players of Seattle</a>
put on our annual Bloomsday reading at the Seattle Central Library.
In October, we arranged a 20th An&shy;niver&shy;sary Cel&shy;e&shy;bra&shy;tion of Irish&nbsp;Writing.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3723742-george-reilly">GoodReads</a>
says I read 113 books in 2018.
Most of those books were on Kindle.
I didn&#8217;t bother to add most of the paperbacks and hardbacks that I read,
so the total is probably closer to 140 books for the&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>In the year leading up to my
<a class="reference external" href="/blog/2017/01/17/KneeWalker.html">heel surgery</a>
at the beginning of 2017,
I lost the habit of cycling to work,
which I had developed over the preceding decade.
I have not yet rebuilt the habit.
I&#8217;m going to work on it in&nbsp;2019.</p>
<p>Emma&#8217;s health has not been good and she&#8217;s had a rough year.
She has a lot of abdominal problems,
which are not well&nbsp;understood.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a poor year for the United States,
with Trump in the Oval Office.
I look forward to the new Democratic Congress
which takes office later this&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to&nbsp;2019!</p>
