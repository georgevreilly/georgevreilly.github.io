    <p>I <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/02/01/ToastmastersContestChair.html">mentioned</a> a few weeks ago that I was going to be the Contest Chair
for the In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al Speech and Evaluation Contests
at <a class="reference external" href="http://freelyspeaking.org/">Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters</a>.
Those contests were tonight,
and I was both Contest Chair and Toast&shy;mas&shy;ter.
The contest chair sets up everything be&shy;fore&shy;hand;
the toast&shy;mas&shy;ter runs the contest itself;
frequently but not nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;i&shy;ly the contest chair is also the&nbsp;toast&shy;mas&shy;ter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy with how it came off.
I managed to recruit two speakers for the Speech contest
and three evaluators for the Evaluation contest,
all of whom acquitted themselves well.
I also recruited three judges, two ballot counters, one timer,
a sergeant at arms, and a test speaker
to make the contest run.
The winner of each contest will go on to the Area 31 contest on March&nbsp;16th.</p>
<p>One point that I forgot to make at the contest
is that a weakness of the Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters&#8217; system
is that most speeches are given to an audience exactly once.
Pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al speakers often deliver the same speech again and again to different audiences,
burnishing it to a high luster.
For most Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters&#8217; speeches,
the speaker has only one op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ty to receive feedback from an audience of evaluators
and no chance to hone and improve a speech through multiple deliveries.
A club contest winner, however, will deliver the same speech again to the area contest.
If they win that, they&#8217;ll repeat it at the division contest.
And if they&#8217;re successful there, they&#8217;ll deliver it at the district contest.
Each time, the com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion is tougher
and the contestant receives feedback from their supporters,
measurably improving their&nbsp;speech.</p>
