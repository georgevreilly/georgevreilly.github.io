    <p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattlestreetcar.org/firsthill.htm">new streetcar line</a> that runs from Pioneer Square to First Hill and Capitol Hill
opened on Saturday.
I rode it this evening to get from First &amp; Jackson to Broadway &amp; Pine,
a three-mile ride that took a full half-hour in the early evening.
The streetcar is clean and pleasant and tem&shy;porar&shy;i&shy;ly free to ride,
but it has no dedicated lane.
Car drivers are still un&shy;ac&shy;cus&shy;tomed to it
and the streetcar driver had to blow his horn several times
at cars that were blocking our progress.</p>
<p>The new light rail extension line will open in March,
connecting Capitol Hill and Husky Stadium.
It's several months early and more than $100 million under budget.
And the new 520 bridge is set to open in April.
It was obvious when I moved here in 1992 that the 520 bridge didn't have enough capacity.
It's a shame that it took another quarter-century to rectify that.</p>
<p>Still, it's a great few months for trans&shy;porta&shy;tion in the Seattle area.
If only <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertha_(tunnel_boring_machine)">Bertha</a> weren't such a disaster.</p>
