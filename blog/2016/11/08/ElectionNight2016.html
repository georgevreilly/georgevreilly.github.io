    <p>As I write this, it&#8217;s 2320 <span class="caps">PST</span> on Election Night 2016.
Trump has 248 votes in the Electoral College,
Clinton has 218;
270 votes are needed to win.
It&#8217;s not over yet—&shy;sev&shy;er&shy;al key swing states have yet to de&shy;clar&shy;e—but it&#8217;s likely that I will wake up to headlines about President-Elect&nbsp;Trump.</p>
<p>What. The. Fuck! America!?
How could we do this?&nbsp;How!?</p>
<p>The most unsuitable, un&shy;qual&shy;i&shy;fied, unfit party nominee ever to run for <span class="caps">US</span> President
is closing in on victory.
One of the most qualified candidates ever is trailing in the polls
and is unlikely to win.
How did this&nbsp;happen?</p>
<p>This is the <span class="caps">US</span>&#8217;s Brexit moment.
We failed.
We fucked up.
This is not how I expected tonight to turn out.
I expected to be toasting President-Elect Clinton by&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>I thought it would be close.
(Thanks, Jim Comey.)
I really did not expect that Trump would be leading at this&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>I get the impulse to stick it to the man.
I&#8217;m not happy with the status quo either
and Clinton represents the safe pair of hands.
Trump is the wild card.
Who knows what he&#8217;ll do.
He&#8217;s been repudiated by the Republican elite
as they can&#8217;t control him either.
Given his marked lack of self-control to date and his au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;tar&shy;i&shy;an impulses,
I&#8217;m not looking forward to four years of Trump.
I survived eight years of Bush,
but right now,
George W. Bush is looking like a re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;ble fucking adult—&shy;some&shy;thing I could hardly have imagined saying in&nbsp;2008.</p>
<p>Dubya eked out two narrow victories and governed as if he had a sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant mandate.
Trump currently has a narrow margin in the popular vote
and a 30-vote lead in the Electoral College,
but I expect him to act as if he won by over&shy;whelm&shy;ing&nbsp;acclaim.</p>
<p>If America were a small country,
it might not matter that much in the global scheme of things.
But the world is watching.
The markets have already spoken, dropping 500&nbsp;points.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping to wake up to better news in the&nbsp;morning.</p>
<p>Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</p>
