    <p>Perhaps I&#8217;ve been spoilt,
but most of the speakers at the technical meetups and con&shy;fer&shy;ences that I go to
have something to say and say it well.
I&#8217;ve also been to hundreds of Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters meetings
and I&#8217;ve heard many speakers at all&nbsp;levels.</p>
<p>I went to a tech meetup tonight and I sat through two bad hour-long pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tions.
The first speaker should have eliminated the first 20 minutes of his talk,
a self-indulgent ramble about various other projects that he had attempted,
which shed no light on his main topic.
He could easily have eliminated another 15 minutes from the rest of his talk
and it would have been the better for it.
Many people, including myself, were obviously bored
and paid more attention to their phones than the speaker.
The speaker had some mildly in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing points to share,
but I can&#8217;t claim that I learned&nbsp;much.</p>
<p>The second talk likewise was too long.
I left before the end, after nearly half the audience had gone.
This speaker was more nervous than the first,
and he was also unfocused and dis&shy;or&shy;ga&shy;nized.
His demos were clumsy and imparted little to the&nbsp;audience.</p>
<p>Tips for would-be technical&nbsp;speakers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Have something to say.
Know what your point is.
What do you want us to take away from your&nbsp;speech?</li>
<li>Rehearse, dammit.
Don&#8217;t just write some slides.
Speaking the words aloud will focus your&nbsp;thoughts.</li>
<li>Rehearse in front of someone who will give you con&shy;struc&shy;tive feedback
about your content and&nbsp;delivery.</li>
<li>Record your rehearsal and watch the video.
Your phone has a video camera, so no excuses.
You will learn a lot from watching&nbsp;yourself.</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Rehearse your demos even more than your&nbsp;speech.</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>What are you&nbsp;demoing?</li>
<li>Why are you demoing&nbsp;this?</li>
<li>Why should we&nbsp;care?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Are your slides <em>legible</em> when you&#8217;re standing at least 10 feet away from your&nbsp;monitor?</li>
<li>Get to the room early and debug the inevitable problems with projectors and&nbsp;audio.</li>
<li>Advice often given to writers is to
<a class="reference external" href="http://writeroutine.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-to-kill-your-darlings.html">kill your darlings</a>â€”remove the parts of your manuscript that you may love
but which do not advance the plot.
Likewise, remove extraneous slides and bullet points from your&nbsp;pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion.</li>
</ul>
