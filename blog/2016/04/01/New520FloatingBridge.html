<p>I moved to Seattle in 1992 and spent the next 13 years commuting to the Eastside,
largely across the <span class="caps">SR</span>-520 Floating Bridge.
Ten of those years were at Microsoft; the rest, elsewhere in Redmond and Bothell.
It was im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly obvious that 520 needed more capacity.
Only now, 24 years later, are we getting that extra capacity:
a new bridge that will replace the old, worn-out bridge.</p>
<p>The old bridge has only two lanes in either direction and there’s no shoulder.
If anything happens, like a flat tire or a stalled car,
one lane im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly grinds to a halt.
The second lane promptly jams up as everyone merges into it.
The oncoming traffic all slows down
as they try to figure out what’s going on.</p>
<p>Even when there were no traffic jams on the bridge,
there was often one ap&shy;proach&shy;ing it,
especially westbound where three lanes contracted to two.
The last mile or two could be painfully slow.</p>
<p>Two days before I got married in 2000,
I was heading west at rush hour.
Traffic was inching along.
There was a car pulled on the shoulder
(it’s only the bridge that lacks shoulders)
with a state trooper walking around it with a clipboard.
I inched past.
Boom!
The guy behind me was so busy rub&shy;ber&shy;neck&shy;ing at the cop
that he hit me at 5mph.
We pulled over and the cop wrote him a ticket for causing an accident.
I had a mild case of whiplash for my wedding.</p>
<p>It took decades of NIMBYism and stalling before the region
finally got its shit together and built the new bridge.
The bridge is open all weekend for a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/weekend-party-to-mark-publics-first-chance-to-try-out-new-520-bridge/">party</a>
allowing the public to walk and run over it.
We plan to go.</p>
