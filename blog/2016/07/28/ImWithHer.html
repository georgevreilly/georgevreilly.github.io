    <p>History was made tonight as Hillary Clinton became the first woman
nominated by a major party to run for President of the <span class="caps">US</span>.
It&#8217;s a watershed moment for women&#8217;s equality and it was long&nbsp;overdue.</p>
<p>I was a Bernie Sanders supporter in the earlier stages of the campaign,
as his message resonated more with me.
But I was always ready and willing to support Clinton.
I can&#8217;t think of a nominee with a more impressive résumé who&#8217;s run for President:
first lady of Arkansas for more than a decade,
First Lady of the <span class="caps">US</span> for two terms,
<span class="caps">US</span> Senator for New York state for eight years,
and Secretary of State for four years.
Moreover, she has a lifelong track record of effective public service
and working with both Re&shy;pub&shy;li&shy;cans and Democrats.
While she&#8217;s been more centrist and cor&shy;po&shy;ratist than I care for,
she&#8217;s also been a pro&shy;gres&shy;sive champion,
especially on health and children issues.
She has survived decades of baseless attacks from the Re&shy;pub&shy;li&shy;cans
and they&#8217;ve never been able to take her down,
though they&#8217;ve certainly led a large number of Americans to distrust&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine myself voting for a Republican president,
as we differ widely on so many issues.
Even so, I&#8217;m astounded at how the Republican party has lost its way.
The rest of the world thinks America has gone quite mad.
It&#8217;s incredible that Donald Trump is the Republican nominee.
His low character, his deplorable tem&shy;pera&shy;ment,
his vile speeches and dem&shy;a&shy;goguery,
his bigotry and misogyny and racism,
his lack of thought or self-control or any knowl&shy;edge—any of these should have dis&shy;qual&shy;i&shy;fied him.
That they didn&#8217;t is an indictment of the Republican party.
He truly is unfit for the office.
While I vigorously disagreed with Romney, McCain, and Bush,
I never thought they were unfit to be&nbsp;President.</p>
<p>Clinton can do the job and do it well.
She has the tem&shy;pera&shy;ment and the experience.
I&#8217;m with&nbsp;her.</p>
