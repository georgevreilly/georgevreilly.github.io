<p>Spolin Games. That sounds like it could be a new set of titles for the&nbsp;Xbox.</p>
<p>Far from&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The Spolin Games are a set of improv theater games invented by Viola
Spolin in the nineteen-thirties, and refined by her for the next six
decades. These games are used in im&shy;pro&shy;vi&shy;sa&shy;tion&shy;al work, to help bring
out creativity and spon&shy;tane&shy;ity. Viola&#8217;s son, Paul Sills, founded the
Second City improv theater company in Chicago back in the&nbsp;nineteen-fifties.</p>

<p>Good article on how the Bush ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion is
<a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/133628_tito10.html">using language to influence public opinion</a>.</p>
<p>Some&nbsp;examples:</p>
<p><em>Civil service reform</em> means &quot;flex&shy;i&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty&quot; to replace civil service
protection with cronyism and&nbsp;patronage.</p>
<p><em>Pri&shy;va&shy;ti&shy;za&shy;tion</em> justifies the notion that cor&shy;po&shy;ra&shy;tions are more likely to
serve the public interest than publicly owned utilities, schools and&nbsp;prisons.</p>
<p><em>Support the troops</em>, a brilliant concept, suggests that if you question
foreign policy or war policy, you have the deaths of our finest young men
and women in uniform on your hands. Objective: to stifle public&nbsp;dissent.</p>

<p>Four re&shy;searchers who culled through 50 years of research literature

political con&shy;ser&shy;vatism is the resistance to change and a tolerance for

political con&shy;ser&shy;vatism&nbsp;include:</p>

Eighty-three other new citizens were sworn in at the same time. Many were

<p>I gave the following speech to Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters on June 25th, 2003, as Speech
#4, &quot;Show What You Mean&quot;. Clearly, I&#8217;ve reused some material from
<a class="reference external" href="/blog/2003/06/11/Bloomsday.html">my earlier post about Bloomsday</a>.
I&#8217;m also finding that I take longer to
deliver a speech to an audience than I do when rehearsing, so I cut some of
the material on the day to fit the seven-minute&nbsp;limit.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve uploaded <a class="reference external" href="http://www.george-reilly.com/photos/Bloomsday-2003/">some photos of the reading</a>
to one of my other&nbsp;websites.</p>

<p>I detest George W. Bush and his ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion. The war, the economy, the
en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment, the judicial battles. I loathe just about everything that
comes out of the White House. I want that man <em>gone</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been following the Democratic pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial candidates with some
interest for the last few months. Right now, I feel like I&#8217;m a yellow dog
Democrat. I don&#8217;t care who wins in 2004, just so long as it&#8217;s a&nbsp;Democrat.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really true, however. I&#8217;d much rather have a candidate that I
have some enthusiasm for, rather than the lesser of two evils: such <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/06/12/HowardDeanForPresident.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I have recently become involved with the upcoming local cel&shy;e&shy;bra&shy;tion of
Bloomsday, on June 16th. James Joyce&#8217;s <em>Ulysses</em> takes place on June 16th,
1904. In Seattle and elsewhere, fans of the book re-enact portions of the
book. In Dublin, Joyce has spawned a whole industry: ironic, when you
consider how little recog&shy;ni&shy;tion he received there during his lifetime. No
doubt, the Joycean industry will go into overdrive next year for the&nbsp;centenary.</p>
<p>The Seattle group has been working its way through the book since 1998.
This year, we are reading Chapters 8 and 9, &quot;Lestry&shy;go&shy;ni&shy;ans&quot; and &quot;Scylla and
Charybdis&quot;. <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/06/11/Bloomsday.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
