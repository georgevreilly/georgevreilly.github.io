<p>Bay Tanner is a young widow and aspiring private in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tor
from wealthy South Carolina stock.
When a hitherto unknown <a class="reference external" href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-shi5.htm">shirt-tail</a> cousin (fifth half cousin, specif&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly)
bursts into Bay's life, she brings havoc in her train.</p>
<p>As one of the characters says,
the plot sounds like a made-for-TV movie.
Still, Bay is a feisty heroine and
the background is not one that has been mined deeply.</p>

<p>We were watching <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHXBL6bzAR4">An Engineer's Guide to Cats</a> on YouTube
when I looked out the front window and spotted these two looking in.
They climbed up the six-foot gooseberry frames to the windowsill.</p>
<p>Meet Whiskey and Guinness, from next door.
They think they own the place.
When it's hot in the summer, they've been known to stroll in
and wander around our living room—while we're in it.</p>
<p>I left the back door open for a few minutes one Saturday morning,
while packing the car.
I came back in and found Whiskey just inside the back room.
He scarpered when I yelled at him and I slammed the door behind him.

<p>We saw <em>The Seafarer</em> at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattlereptickets.org/Plays/0809/SF/">Seattle Rep</a> this afternoon.
Two brothers, Richard and Sharkey, share a house in north Dublin.
There's little love lost between them.
Richard, recently blinded, is con&shy;trol&shy;ling and wheedling.
Sharkey is trying to stay off the gargle
and it's not easy when Richard and his crony Ivan drink like fishes.</p>
<p>Sharkey's old rival, Nicky, arrives on Christmas Eve,
bringing a stranger with him, Mr. Lockhart.
They settle down to a game of poker
and Sharkey privately learns that he's met the stranger once before.
For Mr. Lockhart is the devil and he wants to collect the old <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/09/ReviewTheSeafarer.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Vim has had <a class="reference external" href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html">syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing</a> since version 5.0 in 1998.
It quickly became in&shy;dis&shy;pens&shy;able.
It's hard to go back to looking at mono&shy;chro&shy;mat&shy;ic source code
after you've become accustomed to syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing.</p>
<p>The syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing is tied into Vim's support for col&shy;orschemes,
which define colors for the fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal syntax groups
like <tt class="docutils literal">Number</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Comment</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">String</tt>.
The syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing for a particular language
defines custom syntax groups for specific language features,
such as <tt class="docutils literal">cppEx&shy;cep&shy;tions</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">htmlEndTag</tt>,</p>
<p>The custom syntax groups are <em>linked</em> to the underlying fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal syntax groups.
Hence, if you change your col&shy;orscheme, your syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing is updated au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly.</p>
<p>The re&shy;Struc&shy;tured&shy;Text syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing in Vim 7.2
has some short&shy;com&shy;ings, in my opinion.
For example, <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/07/reStructuredTextSyntaxHighlighting.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>As promised <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/03/06/WhoWatchesTheWatchmen.html">yesterday</a>, we saw the initial midnight showing
of the <em>Watchmen</em> movie at the Pacific Science Center IMAX.
And, lo, the geeks came in their numbers
and they were greatly pleased.
Some were dressed as Rorschach,
one came as a smurf;
no, I lie, he was Dr. Manhattan.</p>
<p>I summarized the plot in my review of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/02/22/ReviewWatchmenBook.html">book</a>.
That still holds: the movie was largely faithful to the book.
In many scenes, it was clear that the book had served as a storyboard.
Too faithful in some ways at 165 minutes long.
Some subplots were elim&shy;i&shy;nat&shy;ed;
no doubt they will resurface <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/06/ReviewWatchmenFilm.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Answer: we do.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(film)">Watchmen movie</a>, that is.
Peter, Carol, Raven, Iain, Emma, and I are all going to see
the midnight initial showing at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pacsci.org/imax/">Pacific Science Center IMAX</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that I've ever been geeky enough to watch
the midnight opening of a movie before.
But it was Peter's idea.</p>
<p>Peter and I shared an apartment in 1990–92 when we were both grad students at Brown,
and it was his copy of <em>Watchmen</em> that I first read.</p>
<p>And so the loop closes.</p>

Somehow all those ads on TV for acne cream
never quite tell you that zits continue after your teenage years.</p>

<p>I knew three of my grand&shy;par&shy;ents; they all died after I reached adulthood.
My mother's father, George Victor Clery, died 12 days before I was born,
on March 3rd, 1965.
I was to be named Vincent after my father, [Charles] Vincent Reilly.
Instead, I was christened George Vincent Reilly.
I was the first grandchild for both the Clerys and the Reillys.
I think I must have been a welcome dis&shy;trac&shy;tion.</p>
<p>Ironically, my parents had gotten married on his birthday,
March 30th, the previous year,
and he didn't live to celebrate their first an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
The timing was partly in his honor
and partly because it was Easter Monday.

<p>A few years ago, after watching one too many whodunnit TV mysterys, I coined my</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>Law of Economy of Characters</em></dt>
<dd>The killer is in&shy;nocu&shy;ous&shy;ly introduced in the first 20 minutes</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>In real life, the killer may not be known until late in the in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion—if ever.</p>
<p>In a TV mystery, any non-recurring character who gets more than a few lines
has to be a potential suspect—to the audience.
The character is not there gra&shy;tu&shy;itous&shy;ly.
Their salary is being paid for a reason.</p>
<p>It's not uni&shy;ver&shy;sal&shy;ly true, but it works more often than not.
It's less true in books, where throwaway characters are easy to introduce.</p>

<p>At lunch today, I told Eric about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec03/tech/full_papers/crosby/crosby.pdf">Hash Attacks</a>:
for many hash functions,
it's possible to construct a large set of keys that collide.
This can be used to cause a Denial of Service
as hashtable operations can be induced
to take <em>O(n)</em> time instead of <em>O(1)</em>.</p>
<p>Crosby and Wallach suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly <a class="reference external" href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec03/tech/full_papers/crosby/crosby.pdf">demon&shy;strat&shy;ed</a> this
against a number of ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions.</p>
<p>Andrew has a good writeup of <a class="reference external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120318203841/http://www.team5150.com/~andrew/blog/2007/03/hash_algorithm_attacks.html">Hash Algorithm Attacks</a>.</p>
<p>There are various mit&shy;i&shy;ga&shy;tions suggested.
The one that I used when I first became aware of this problem
is to use a salt to the hash function.</p>
<p>In other words, change:</p>

unsigned hash(const char* s)
