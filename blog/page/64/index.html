<p>Vim has had <a class="reference external" href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html">syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing</a> since version 5.0 in 1998.
It quickly became in&shy;dis&shy;pens&shy;able.
It's hard to go back to looking at mono&shy;chro&shy;mat&shy;ic source code
after you've become accustomed to syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing.</p>
<p>The syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing is tied into Vim's support for col&shy;orschemes,
which define colors for the fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal syntax groups
like <tt class="docutils literal">Number</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Comment</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">String</tt>.
The syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing for a particular language
defines custom syntax groups for specific language features,
such as <tt class="docutils literal">cppEx&shy;cep&shy;tions</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">htmlEndTag</tt>,</p>
<p>The custom syntax groups are <em>linked</em> to the underlying fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal syntax groups.
Hence, if you change your col&shy;orscheme, your syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing is updated au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly.</p>
<p>The re&shy;Struc&shy;tured&shy;Text syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing in Vim 7.2
has some short&shy;com&shy;ings, in my opinion.
For example, <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/07/reStructuredTextSyntaxHighlighting.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>As promised <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/03/06/WhoWatchesTheWatchmen.html">yesterday</a>, we saw the initial midnight showing
of the <em>Watchmen</em> movie at the Pacific Science Center IMAX.
And, lo, the geeks came in their numbers
and they were greatly pleased.
Some were dressed as Rorschach,
one came as a smurf;
no, I lie, he was Dr. Manhattan.</p>
<p>I summarized the plot in my review of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/02/22/ReviewWatchmenBook.html">book</a>.
That still holds: the movie was largely faithful to the book.
In many scenes, it was clear that the book had served as a storyboard.
Too faithful in some ways at 165 minutes long.
Some subplots were elim&shy;i&shy;nat&shy;ed;
no doubt they will resurface <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/06/ReviewWatchmenFilm.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Answer: we do.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(film)">Watchmen movie</a>, that is.
Peter, Carol, Raven, Iain, Emma, and I are all going to see
the midnight initial showing at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pacsci.org/imax/">Pacific Science Center IMAX</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that I've ever been geeky enough to watch
the midnight opening of a movie before.
But it was Peter's idea.</p>
<p>Peter and I shared an apartment in 1990–92 when we were both grad students at Brown,
and it was his copy of <em>Watchmen</em> that I first read.</p>
<p>And so the loop closes.</p>

<p>I knew three of my grand&shy;par&shy;ents; they all died after I reached adulthood.
My mother's father, George Victor Clery, died 12 days before I was born,
on March 3rd, 1965.
I was to be named Vincent after my father, [Charles] Vincent Reilly.
Instead, I was christened George Vincent Reilly.
I was the first grandchild for both the Clerys and the Reillys.
I think I must have been a welcome dis&shy;trac&shy;tion.</p>
<p>Ironically, my parents had gotten married on his birthday,
March 30th, the previous year,
and he didn't live to celebrate their first an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
The timing was partly in his honor
and partly because it was Easter Monday.

<p>A few years ago, after watching one too many whodunnit TV mysterys, I coined my</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>Law of Economy of Characters</em></dt>
<dd>The killer is in&shy;nocu&shy;ous&shy;ly introduced in the first 20 minutes</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>In real life, the killer may not be known until late in the in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion—if ever.</p>
<p>In a TV mystery, any non-recurring character who gets more than a few lines
has to be a potential suspect—to the audience.
The character is not there gra&shy;tu&shy;itous&shy;ly.
Their salary is being paid for a reason.</p>
<p>It's not uni&shy;ver&shy;sal&shy;ly true, but it works more often than not.
It's less true in books, where throwaway characters are easy to introduce.</p>

<p>At lunch today, I told Eric about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec03/tech/full_papers/crosby/crosby.pdf">Hash Attacks</a>:
for many hash functions,
it's possible to construct a large set of keys that collide.
This can be used to cause a Denial of Service
as hashtable operations can be induced
to take <em>O(n)</em> time instead of <em>O(1)</em>.</p>
<p>Crosby and Wallach suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly <a class="reference external" href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec03/tech/full_papers/crosby/crosby.pdf">demon&shy;strat&shy;ed</a> this
against a number of ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions.</p>
<p>Andrew has a good writeup of <a class="reference external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120318203841/http://www.team5150.com/~andrew/blog/2007/03/hash_algorithm_attacks.html">Hash Algorithm Attacks</a>.</p>
<p>There are various mit&shy;i&shy;ga&shy;tions suggested.
The one that I used when I first became aware of this problem
is to use a salt to the hash function.</p>
<p>In other words, change:</p>

unsigned hash(const char* s)

    unsigned h = 0;

<p>I use or par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pate in a handful of wikis hosted at <a class="reference external" href="http://pbwiki.com/">PBwiki</a>.
A year ago, I wrote a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/vim/pbwiki/">PBwiki syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing plugin for Vim</a>,
modeled after the ones that I put together for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/vim/flexwiki/">FlexWiki</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/vim/stwiki/">SocialText</a> wikis.
Es&shy;sen&shy;tial&shy;ly, paste the wikitext into Vim,
get syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing, edit the text,
then paste it back into the multiline textbox.
I find the WYSIWYG editors annoying.</p>
<p>PBwiki is forcing all wikis to switch over to v2.0 by March 9th.
The good news is that the upgrade is painless and reliable.
They offer <a class="reference external" href="http://pbwiki.com/content/pbwiki-2-user-guide">new features</a>, such as an improved editor,
better access control, and a new look.</p>

<p>One thing that's been bugging me since I started using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/01/22/UsingOpera.aspx">Opera</a>
is that <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text was showing as normal text in my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/">personal blog</a>.
Yet other browsers were correctly displaying bold and italic on my blog.</p>
<p>I'm still not entirely sure why Mac Opera had a problem with it,
but I fixed it by using the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brownbatterystudios.com/sixthings/2007/03/14/lucida-hybrid-the-grande-alternative/">Lucida Hybrid</a> stylesheet tweak.</p>
<p>I adjusted a few other things while I was at it.
The most obvious is that the font size is larger.</p>
<p>Most RSS readers won't pick up the stylesheet,
so take a look at the actual <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/">blog</a>.</p>
