<p>I can&#8217;t believe that I&#8217;ve never taken the train down to Portland before.
It&#8217;s easy, it&#8217;s in&shy;ex&shy;pen&shy;sive, and it&#8217;s about as quick as driving without the&nbsp;hassle.</p>

<p>I rode on a Segway today, for the first time.
It was a lot of fun: a two-hour of Portland&#8217;s waterfront
with nine other motsscon people.
I could have done without the 80°F heat&nbsp;though.</p>
<p>It took a few minutes for me to find my balance and to feel com&shy;fort&shy;able.
After that, it came pretty&nbsp;naturally.</p>
<p>Highly&nbsp;rec&shy;om&shy;mend&shy;ed.</p>

<p>Today, I did something that I&#8217;ve never done before.
I visited my <span class="caps">US</span> Senators&#8217; offices, with a handful of others,
to help stiffen their spines on healthcare&nbsp;reform.</p>
<p>It started by accident last night when Mira mentioned on Facebook
that she was going to visit Rep. Jim McDermott, Sen. Maria Cantwell,
and Sen. Patty Murray&#8217;s Seattle offices today
to talk to them about the “public&nbsp;option”.</p>
<p>McDermott and Murray were already supporters of the public health insurance option.
Cantwell&#8217;s position was murkier and she came out in favor of
some kind of lame “co-op” compromise earlier this week.
Mira and her friends had no difficulty in setting up meetings with McDermott and <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/06/27/TalkingToSenatorsAboutHealthcareReform.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>It seems no-one thought to set up a map of the events and restau&shy;rants,

It was sur&shy;pris&shy;ing&shy;ly painless and the sug&shy;ges&shy;tions for businesses near an address
really&nbsp;helped.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: 10 minutes after writing the above,
Google Maps crashed Safari&nbsp;4 while trying to print the&nbsp;map.</p>

when he is murdered.
His advisor, Joanne Kilbourn, sees him drink the poison.
Her own husband was sense&shy;less&shy;ly murdered a few years earlier,
and Andy was not only her boss but an old friend, so it&#8217;s difficult for her.
When she decides to write a biography of Andy
and learns unexpected things about him,
her health mys&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;ous&shy;ly begins to&nbsp;fail.</p>

I blamed Windows Update, since it happened within hours of a pile of updates being installed.
I upgraded to the latest beta NVidia drivers on Monday
and it helped for a while, but by Wednesday,
it was almost as bad again as it had been last Friday.
It was in&shy;fu&shy;ri&shy;at&shy;ing and I was both en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing and alarming my neighbors
