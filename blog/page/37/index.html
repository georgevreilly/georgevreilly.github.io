<p>I bought a <span class="caps">2TB</span> external hard disk today.
It&#8217;s about the size of a deck of cards, but thinner,
and it cost me $95.
Disk Utility says it has 2,000,397,884,928&nbsp;bytes.</p>
<p>In 1998, I got to see more than three terabytes of disks in one system.
At the time, a server with a <span class="caps">25GB</span> disk was considered high capacity.
The <span class="caps">3TB</span> system occupied con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;ably more volume than a pack of cards.
I don&#8217;t know what it cost
but clearly it was tens if not hundreds of thousands of&nbsp;dollars.</p>
<p>At that time, I was a developer on the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services"><span class="caps">IIS</span></a> team at Microsoft.

<p>When I posted a link to the new <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/2015/01/leatherman-tread/">Leatherman Tread Bracelet</a> on Facebook
the other day, I mentioned that I had recently forfeited a little Swiss Army knife

The Tread is a bracelet where each link has one or more mini-tools.
The bracelet itself is about $150–$200, depending upon the exact tools.
With a watch, it&#8217;s about&nbsp;$600.</p>

we&#8217;ve enjoyed some un&shy;sea&shy;son&shy;ably warm weather in the Northwest.
Yesterday, it was 63°F (17°C) in Seattle—<a class="reference external" href="http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/seattle-sets-weather-record-boston-prepares-massiv/njw6m/">a record high tem&shy;per&shy;a&shy;ture</a>.

One friend dubbed it&nbsp;“sumter”.</p>

    <p>Washington state is well-known for coffee, wineries, and mi&shy;cro&shy;brew&shy;eries.
Dozens of small-batch craft dis&shy;til&shy;leries
have been started in Washington state since 2008
after a change in the law.
Most of them are quite good.
I drink Irish and Scotch whiskies,
but otherwise neither of us drink spirits often,
so we&#8217;ve barely tried the local&nbsp;dis&shy;til&shy;leries.</p>
<p>We drank a really nice gin from Sun Liquor at a New Year&#8217;s Eve party,
and we&#8217;ve been meaning to follow up.
This afternoon, we stopped at the Oola Distillery on Capitol Hill
and sampled all their wares.
We left with a half bottle of their

    <p>When I buy a book, I want to be able to read it how and where I like,
not where the bookseller dictates.
With printed books, the very idea of the bookseller having any say is ridiculous.
The book is now my property, to read where and how I like,
to give away or to lend or even to sell.
I&#8217;ve bought thousands of new books and thousands more secondhand books from&nbsp;bookstores.</p>
<p>Most electronic books are crippled with <span class="caps">DRM</span>.
<span class="caps">DRM</span> stands for <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">Digital Rights Management</a>,

I just finished reading it as an ebook on my phone.
I enjoyed it a lot but I think I found it funnier when I heard it as an audiobook.
Partly, the first time around, I didn&#8217;t know what was coming next;
partly, the narrator&#8217;s skillful delivery gave me time to savor the humor.

    <p>I sat in a deserted coffee shop this afternoon with Emma,
as much of Seattle was watching the playoff game
of the Seattle Seahawks against the Green Bay Packers.
Idly curious, I checked the score early in the fourth quarter
and found that the Packers were leading 19–7.
I was quite surprised later to find that the Seahawks had won 28–22,
sending themselves to the Super Bowl in Arizona in two weeks&#8217; time.
Apparently, it was a thrilling comeback late in the&nbsp;game.</p>
<p>I suppose that I&#8217;m happy for my football-loving friends,
though I&#8217;m inclined to “love the sinner but hate the sin”,
as I can&#8217;t stand football.
