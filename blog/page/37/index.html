    <p>I sat in a deserted coffee shop this afternoon with Emma,
as much of Seattle was watching the playoff game
of the Seattle Seahawks against the Green Bay Packers.
Idly curious, I checked the score early in the fourth quarter
and found that the Packers were leading 19–7.
I was quite surprised later to find that the Seahawks had won 28–22,
sending themselves to the Super Bowl in Arizona in two weeks&#8217; time.
Apparently, it was a thrilling comeback late in the&nbsp;game.</p>
<p>I suppose that I&#8217;m happy for my football-loving friends,
though I&#8217;m inclined to “love the sinner but hate the sin”,
as I can&#8217;t stand football.

<p>Every few years, I find it necessary to wipe my computers
and do a clean install of the operating system.
As a developer and a power user, I install a lot of software.
The cumulative effect of in&shy;stal&shy;la&shy;tions and upgrades
is to leave a lot of cruft on the machines.
Entropy increases and the machines grow slower and perhaps less reliable.
So I like to wipe the hard disk, install a new operating system,
and reinstall only those apps that I know I&nbsp;need.</p>
<p>My mid-2012 MacBook Pro came with <span class="caps">OS</span> X 10.7.
Shortly thereafer, 10.8 was released and I promptly upgraded; likewise with 10.9.

<p>Jack Whyte&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camulod_Chronicles">Camulod Chronicles</a> is a series of novels
about King Arthur and Camelot in a post-Roman Britain.
This book tells how Lancelot (Clothar the Frank) came to Camulod and met Arthur—and it takes the entire book to get to that point.
Only after several hundred pages of Clothar&#8217;s childhood and early manhood
and fighting a civil war in his uncle&#8217;s small kingdom in Gaul,
do we proceed to&nbsp;Britain.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve always been an avid—nay, avari&shy;cious—read&shy;er of books.
But I have not been a listener of&nbsp;audiobooks.</p>
<p>I read quickly, much more quickly than anyone can speak,
and I enjoy burying my head in a book.
I&#8217;ve seen little reason, therefore, to listen to audiobooks.
Lately, however, we&#8217;ve listened to some audiobooks on long car trips,
as Emma, unlike me, has an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.audible.com/">Audible</a> sub&shy;scrip&shy;tion.
We enjoyed <a class="reference external" href="https://mobile.audible.com/pd/Mysteries-Thrillers/The-Hot-Rock-Audiobook/B003N9T8SA">The Hot Rock</a>, the first of the comic crime-caper <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dortmunder">Dortmunder</a> books.
Before that, I had read another Dortmunder novel, <em>Bank Shot</em>, aloud to Emma,
while she drove us back from Portland,
which both of us had&nbsp;enjoyed.</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Tony McLean of the Edinburgh Police has multiple deaths to deal with:
an elderly rich man, murdered horribly;
the newly discovered corpse of a girl killed in some ghoulish ritual sixty years ago;
and the the death of the grand&shy;moth&shy;er who raised him.
Then more elderly men start being&nbsp;murdered.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this police procedural and I liked the character of Tony McLean.
The two cases start dove&shy;tail&shy;ing together (one of my pet peeves)
and I was surprised when the author introduced su&shy;per&shy;nat&shy;ur&shy;al elements,

<p>We discovered <a class="reference external" href="http://www.adessobistro.net/">Adesso Bistro</a> just around the corner
from where we&#8217;re staying in the West End of Vancouver.
It was very quiet tonight, with only one other table occupied while we were there
and another table leaving as we&nbsp;arrived.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the Prix Fixe menu of Gnocchi, Brasato (braised beef), and Panna Cotta.
Emma wasn&#8217;t feeling too well,
so she had a light salad and half a mushroom pizza.
Both the food and the service were very good.
We&#8217;d certainly go&nbsp;again.</p>

    <p>We&#8217;re spending a few days in Vancouver.
<em>The</em> Vancouver.
The Canadian city in British Columbia.
Not to be confused with the large Canadian island,
Vancouver Island, just a few miles away,
or the American city of Vancouver, Washington,
which is a suburb of Portland,&nbsp;Oregon.</p>
<p>We like to come up to Vancouver a couple of times a year.
It&#8217;s only 140 miles from Seattle,
but you have to cross the U.S.–Canadian border
and the highway runs out about ten miles from downtown Vancouver,
so it always takes at least three hours to drive&nbsp;up.</p>

I had my eyes tested last month and there is a small change in the pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion.

I developed the classic problem of middle age:
it became hard for me to read.
