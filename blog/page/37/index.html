<p>Andy Boychuk has just become the leader of the opposition party in Saskatchewan
when he is murdered.
His advisor, Joanne Kilbourn, sees him drink the poison.
Her own husband was sense&shy;less&shy;ly murdered a few years earlier,
and Andy was not only her boss but an old friend, so it's difficult for her.
When she decides to write a biography of Andy
and learns unexpected things about him,
her health mys&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;ous&shy;ly begins to fail.</p>
<p>Joanne is a middle-aged widow with children,
who has spent her life working behind the scenes in Saskatchewan politics.

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)">Up</a> is another gem from Pixar.
A shy little boy Carl Fredrick&shy;sen meets the exuberant Ellie,
who also hero worships Charles Muntz, noted explorer of Paradise Falls.
They grow old together and Ellie dies
before they can achieve their lifelong dream of an adventure.
With nothing left to lose, Carl attaches 10,000 helium balloons to his house
and floats off to South America in search of Paradise Falls,

<p>The movie appealed just as much to the kids at our showing as the adults.
The sto&shy;ry&shy;telling is first rate, combining humor, adventure, love, and pathos.

I blamed Windows Update, since it happened within hours of a pile of updates being installed.
I upgraded to the latest beta NVidia drivers on Monday
and it helped for a while, but by Wednesday,
it was almost as bad again as it had been last Friday.
It was in&shy;fu&shy;ri&shy;at&shy;ing and I was both en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing and alarming my neighbors

Eric was intrigued too when I showed him a photo later,

As yet, the menu is limited.
The Maximus is a pulled pork sandwich with a hot sauce,
while the Minimus has a tangy sauce.
They have a vegetarian sandwich, chips made from potatoes and vegetables,
and hibiscus and ginger lemonades.</p>
<p>I don't much care for barbecue as a rule.
The Minimus with a sprinkling of Beecher's cheese was good, but not out&shy;stand&shy;ing.

Don't Ask Don't Tell, and more.</p>
<p>President Obama has been a big dis&shy;ap&shy;point&shy;ment on gay rights.
He hasn't done anything about DADT,
he hasn't spoken out about gay marriage,

re-enacting fragments of <em>Ulysses</em> in Dublin. Perhaps the best line:</p>
<blockquote>
Back in the city centre, a sign outside Davy Byrne’s advertised
a Bloomsday special: Gorgonzola cheese sandwiches and burgundy for €12.90.
Someone nearby complained loudly that prices had gone up since 1904.</blockquote>
<p>A Spanish translator of <em>Ulysses</em> remarked:</p>

His ashes are delivered to his cousin Horace, also a retired spy,

a mad sultan with nukes who covets a first-century manuscript

<p>I filled six densely packed barrels with yard waste today,
before and after the victory barbecue for the Wild Geese Players.
No wonder I'm tired.</p>
<p>Three barrels from the pile of clippings left over
from cir&shy;cum&shy;cis&shy;ing the camelia tree on Memorial Day weekend,
and another three from the big bush that Emma hates in the front rock garden.
The latter barely looks pruned at all.</p>

<p>Our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2009.html">2009 Bloomsday reading</a> is over!
I thought it went very well.
We had quite a large audience by our stan&shy;dard&shy;s—about 30 people,
we got a lot of laughs, and most of them stayed until the end.</p>
<p>Of all the spaces that we've performed in, I like the University Bookstore the best.
The events area is sunny, airy, and spacious,
and easily discovered by customers in the store.
The staff were very helpful and easy to work with.
I'd prefer not to do another event on the same day
as the University of Wash&shy;ing&shy;ton's Com&shy;menc&shy;ment, however.</p>
