<p>My nephew's name is Harold Mark Bowles, to be known as Harry.
I assume the Mark is after my brother.
No idea about the Harold/Harry.</p>
<p>I said <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/12/14/NewBabies.html">before</a> that my mother was very excited at becoming a grand&shy;moth&shy;er.
Here's the proof: take a look at the huge smile on her face.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, she was trying to decide what her new title was to be.
She was really pleased at becoming a granny,
but not at all eager to be known as “Granny”.
She tried out “Nan Et” (Et for Ethna), which we promptly turned into “Nanette”.
“Gran Et” was even worse: with a strong Dublin accent it <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/01/08/Harry.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I wrote <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/12/17/ToFrankAndLyndol.html">three weeks ago</a>, that Frank's time was limited.
He died yesterday at 3am of liver failure.
He had been un&shy;con&shy;scious since Saturday,
and he had been moved to a hospital bed in his living room on Thursday.</p>
<p>I was at a coffee shop near work yesterday morning
when Emma called me to relay the news from Lyndol.
We hurried over there and spent the rest of the day with him,
helping out as various friends came over.</p>
<p>Lyn is doing as well as can be expected.
He's sad, oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly weepy, and sometimes a little manic.
I think he's relieved that Frank's ordeal is over.

<p>At 12:44am Monday (Irish Time), Michelle gave birth to a 9lb 8oz boy.
Mother and son are healthy but exhausted.
I'm not sure quite how long the actual labor lasted;
but I think she started late on Saturday.</p>
<p>My nephew is, as yet, unnamed.
David and Michelle have yet to find a boy's name that both of them really like.
Under Irish law, they have three months to do so,
but Michelle hopes to pick a name within a few days at most.</p>

The focus has switched to a younger set of characters,
the first generation to grow up after the “Change”,
the event that knocked the world back into the Dark Ages.</p>
<p>A traveler arrives in Oregon from the East, bearing a compelling prophecy that
requires Rudi Mackenzie to travel to Nantucket, the apparent source of the Change.
A group of nine (the number is tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al) head eastwards.

<p>When my parents visited me in September,
I bought them a second laptop and an external drive for backup.
One laptop stays in Dublin, the other in Cape Town where they spend much of their year.
Both laptops are in Dublin with me at present,
so that I can clean them up and get them in sync.
(I had to remove some very obscure registry settings to
get one DVD drive working again. &lt;sigh/&gt;)</p>
<p>Their backup needs are simple.
Both of them have web-based email at Yahoo!.
The only personal data on either computer is photos.
Inevitably the photos are out of sync between the two machines.</p>

The hunch&shy;backed lawyer Matthew Shardlake
has been sent to York by Archbishop Cranmer to meet the Royal Progress,
where Henry VIII is to accept formal surrender from those
who had earlier rebelled.
Shardlake is to hear petitions on the king's behalf,
but really he is there to ensure that a high-ranking con&shy;spir&shy;a&shy;tor
is brought safely back to the Tower of London.
He stumbles upon a cache of secret papers,
which leads to a series of attempts upon his life.</p>

Far to the south, Amara and Bernard accompany the First Lord, Gaius Sixtus,

<p>My friends Frank and Lyndol met 32 years ago today,
the day they celebrate as their an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
For several years, Emma and I have brought them out for dinner on this date.
We also celebrate Lyn's birthday,
which falls next week.</p>
<p>Frank's health has been poor for some years,
but it's grown worse this year.
He spent six weeks in hospital in September and October.
He's home now, but he's in <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.motss/browse_thread/thread/38e9223106252317">hospice care</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, we try to see him often,
since he rarely feels strong enough to leave the house,
even in a wheelchair.
We almost always find him in good form,
glad to see us and ready with his stories.</p>

<p>It snowed in Seattle yesterday.
We drove over to Sammamish last night to my CEO's house
for the Holiday Party.
The snow wasn't sticking to the roads,
so although visibility wasn't great,
getting there and back was not difficult.</p>
<p>It was cold today and colder tonight.
I saw only a light dusting of snow fall today,
but the snow that was melting earlier has refrozen.</p>
<p>We had to go out this evening,
over to Burien to see Frank.
The main roads were fine,
but we had a slightly alarming descent
on a hill near us as we headed over there.
Coming home, we had a couple of unpleasant minutes

<p>Lots of new babies around.</p>
<p>Dilip in North Carolina emailed me the other day
and mentioned the recent birth of his daughter, Anuragini.
And Alan in Dublin emailed me this morning,
to tell me of the birth of his daughter, Beth.</p>
<p>My sister, Michelle Bowles, is due to give birth on the 19th
to the first Reilly grandchild.
We arrive in Dublin on the 21st.
First babies tend to be born late,
so we may get there before the baby does.
She and David have elected not to learn the gender of the baby,
so I addressed their Christmas card to &quot;Michelle, David, and TBD&quot;.</p>
