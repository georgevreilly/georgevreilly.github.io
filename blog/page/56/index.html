<p>We’re off to Spain and Ireland tomorrow evening,
so lots of last-minute prepa­ra­tions tonight.
I laid out my clothes on the spare bed on Sunday;
Emma picked out hers this evening.
I’ve just paid some bills and I’m trans­fer­ring files onto the netbook that I’m bringing.</p>
<p>I still have to whittle down the large pile of books that are under con­sid­er­a­tion.
I don’t want to run out before we get to Ireland,
but I don’t want to take too many.
Depending on what else is going on,
I’ll get through a book in a day or two when I’m on vacation.
Maybe two books on those long plane flights.</p>

<p>I mentioned three weeks ago that I was putting together a group of people
to see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.greenstage.org/2009/comedyoferrors">Greenstage</a>‘s production of Shake­speare’s <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/06/24/ShakespeareInTheParkComedyOfErrors.html">Comedy of Errors</a>
at the Seward Park Am­phithe­ater.
Six of us braved the rain last night,
ate our picnic, and enjoyed an hour and a half of ribald slapstick.</p>
<p>Almost all of the cast cross-dressed.
The main male parts, the two sets of identical twin brothers, were played by women,
The wife, her sister, and the courtesan were played by ugly men
in the best <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantomime_dame">panto dame</a> tradition.</p>
<p>The play, like so many of Shake­speare’s comedies,
requires an endless series of confused identities,
which could be cleared up in moments
if only someone paused <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/07/14/ComedyOfErrors.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Two picnics this weekend.</p>
<p>Today we held the tenth annual <a class="reference external" href="http://www.binetseattle.org/">BiNet Seattle</a> picnic for the bisexual community,
which I once again organized, with some help from Emma.
Almost all of the preceding ones were held at Ravenna Park.
Even though I booked the picnic back in March,
Ravenna Park was un­avail­able this weekend,
which was the only weekend that really suited me.
We went to Golden Gardens Beach instead.
It’s a nice park, but parking is atrocious on a busy weekend,
which may explain the poor turnout.
There were only 10 people, down from 20–30 for the last few years.
Three new faces; the rest were regulars.
As usual, Emma and I brought <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/07/12/Picnics.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>For weeks, Lyn has been telling us about the musical talk that
he was going to give today at his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rvuuc.org/"><span class="caps">UU</span> con­gre­ga­tion</a>
about <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Strayhorn">Billy Strayhorn</a>, a little-known but talented composer,
who col­lab­o­rat­ed for decades with Duke Ellington.
Strayhorn was openly gay in the homophobic decades before Stonewall.
That, coupled with his apparent liking for remaining in Elling­ton’s shadow,
probably con­tributed to his obscurity.</p>
<p>Lyn talked about Billy Strayhorn and his life and music for half an hour.
He also ac­com­pa­nied Shirley singing some Strayhorn songs on piano,
as Linda and Marion played the clarinet and cello.
He said that Stray­horn’s life gives rise to two questions,

Nine or ten years after I first ported parts of <span class="caps">IIS</span> to Win64,
I am finally running my main desktop on 64-bit Windows.
With one exception, it’s been painless.
Programs have just worked, devices have just worked.
There are relatively few native x64 ap­pli­ca­tions,
but for the most part it doesn’t matter.
The cases where it does matter—e.g., shell extensions such as <a class="reference external" href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">Tor­tois­eSVN</a>—are available as 64-bit binaries.</p>

<p>We held our <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/07/08/HealthCareNowRallyOnThursday.html">rally</a> for healthcare and the public option at lunchtime,
outside the Jackson Federal Building
where both Senators Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray
have their Seattle offices.</p>
<p>Turnout was good: about 100 people, I’d say.
We had about half-a-dozen speakers over 45 minutes.
A cameraman from King–5 covered it, but I can’t find anything on their website.
A handful of people went upstairs to the senators’ offices
and delivered 291 pages of petitions.</p>
<p>One concrete suggestion that I came away with
is to write a <em>hand­writ­ten</em> letter to the senators
advocating for healthcare reform.
Hand­writ­ten letters carry more weight than printed letters or calls
and much more weight than emails.</p>
<p>Do it soon.

<p>We’re traveling to Spain and Ireland for three weeks.
I’m bringing the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/04/25/UbuntuNetbookRemix904.html">netbook</a>, not the 17" MacBook Pro, because it’s small and light.
It doesn’t have a <span class="caps">DVD</span> player and I’d like to bring some DVDs to watch.
I could either spend about $80 on an external <span class="caps">DVD</span> player,
or I could rip the DVDs beforehand.</p>
<p>I’ve ripped a few DVDs with <a class="reference external" href="http://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a>,
an open source, cross-platform video transcoder,
which seems to do a good job.
I’m playing them in the cross-platform <a class="reference external" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"><span class="caps">VLC</span></a> player,
which released version 1.0.0 yesterday, after almost 8 years of de­vel­op­ment.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, a group of us <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/06/27/TalkingToSenatorsAboutHealthcareReform.html">visited our senators’ offices</a>
to talk to their staffers about the Public Option in health care.
We’re organizing a downtown Seattle rally at the Federal Building on Thursday at 12:15pm,
where both Senators Cantwell and Murray have their offices.
It’s one of the large number of rallies that <a class="reference external" href="http://pol.moveon.org/event/events/index.html?action_id=180">MoveOn.org is organizing</a>
at senators’ offices all around the country on Thursday.</p>
<p>Will sent out this email to a number of people earlier this evening
and I’m going to reprint it here.</p>

<p>Lyn, Raven, and Iain came over on Friday night for dinner.
We did a little planning for Frank’s memorial today
and selected some poems.</p>
<p>Emma and I packed up the car and got to Lyn’s by noon,
which gave us plenty of time to set up.
I wore my com­mem­o­ra­tive <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/07/03/PortlandMotssconXXII.html">Portland motsscon</a> t-shirt,
which I know Frank would have gotten a kick out of.</p>
<p>A dozen or so of Frank’s friends arrived around 2 o’clock.
We chatted for a while waiting for Holly and Kim to arrive
after fighting through the crowded ferry system from Vashon Island.
Shirley sang <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039853/soundtrack">You’re Not So Easy to Forget</a>,
