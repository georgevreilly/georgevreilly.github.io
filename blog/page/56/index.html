<p>When we were in Spain in July, we visited the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salvador-dali.org/museus/figueres/en_index.html">Dalí museum</a> in Figueres.
The museum is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>&#8216;s monument to himself; he spent his latter years building it.
The guided tour was well worth the money.
I came away believing that Dalí was both enormously talented and full of&nbsp;shit.</p>
<p>The next day, purely by chance, we passed a sign for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salvador-dali.org/museus/pubol/en_index.html">Gala&#8217;s castle</a>
at Pubol while driving around in the coun&shy;try&shy;side.

had bought for Gala, his wife <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/08/21/ReviewACoffinForTwo.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

She was there to hear from small business people about healthcare reform

Barney Frank Confronts Woman at Town Hall

<p>In the video above,
Barney Frank takes a question from some woman who&#8217;s comparing Obama to a Nazi
and tells her she&#8217;s talking “vile, con&shy;temptible&nbsp;nonsense”.</p>
<p>I hope it&#8217;s not going to escalate into outright&nbsp;violence.</p>

<p>Tommy Flood is another of Chris Moore&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/08/29/ReviewADirtyJob.html">Beta Males</a>.
He&#8217;s also a brand-new 19-year-old vampire, newly turned by his girlfriend Jody—her&shy;self only a vampire for a few months.
He&#8217;s not too keen about his new state, but he&#8217;s trying to cope.
It doesn&#8217;t help that his former crew of shelf stockers at Safeway
are trying to hunt his vampire ass.
And he has a 16-year-old Goth chick for a minion who thinks
the Lord Flood is like <span class="caps">OMG</span> totally&nbsp;hot.</p>

<p>When using Lightroom before, I was never able to figure out how
to move photos from one folder to another.
You&#8217;d think that you could just click on a photo and drag it.
I just spent twenty minutes figuring out what I&#8217;ve been doing wrong.
After you&#8217;ve selected multiple photos,
click on the <em>photo thumbnail</em> and <em>not</em> the sur&shy;round&shy;ing gray frame,
and then you can drag the photos to the target&nbsp;folder.</p>
<p>I had become accustomed to clicking on the frames to multi-select photos,
so naturally I assumed that was also how you dragged a set of photos.
But clicking on a frame of a selected photo merely deselects all <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/08/16/MovingPhotosInLightroom.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>The unnamed nar&shy;ra&shy;tor—My name? If I told you that you&#8217;d be as clever as me—is an up-and-coming London drug dealer who wants to retire by his thirtieth birthday.
He&#8217;s pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al, low-key, and a little bit cocky,
and he has every chance of pulling it off.
He re&shy;luc&shy;tant&shy;ly does a favor for the crime boss Jimmy Price and
suddenly his plans are derailed.
Double-crosses, snitches, betrayals, murders, hold ups, and stings ensue.
There&#8217;s little honor among thieves, save for our hero&#8217;s immediate&nbsp;circle.</p>

<p>After reading <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/08/15/ReviewLayerCakeBook.html">Layer Cake</a> earlier this week, I decided to rewatch the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_Cake_(film)">movie</a>.
The screenplay was written by <span class="caps">J.J.</span> Connolly, adapting his own novel.
Although the convoluted plot has been much simplified and somewhat rearranged,
it&#8217;s still complex and tricky to follow.
Most of the humor is gone, as director Matthew Vaughn didn&#8217;t want to make <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock,_Stock_and_Two_Smoking_Barrels">Lock Stock</a> <span class="caps">III</span>.
It&#8217;s more of a straight thriller.
The Cockney is toned down, making it easier for a non-<span class="caps">UK</span> audience.
And Daniel Craig is somewhat older and calmer than the narrator of the&nbsp;book.</p>
<p>The film succeeds both in its own right <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/08/15/ReviewLayerCakeMovie.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I rode Seattle&#8217;s new Light Rail system for the first time yesterday morning.
I walked to the new Beacon Hill station.
It took me just over 20&nbsp;minutes at a brisk pace,
so I&#8217;m not likely to walk there often.
I could have taken the 60&nbsp;bus to the station,
but it only runs every&nbsp;30&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<p>When I got to the Beacon Hill station,
I couldn&#8217;t figure out if my book of $2.00&nbsp;tickets
for Metro bus tickets were valid on the train or not.
The first three workers I asked didn&#8217;t know either.
The cop I asked said “yes”, so I took the elevator 167&nbsp;feet down to the platform
and rode the train into <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/08/14/LightRail.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Tonight was the annual Irish Night at the Mariners
and we bought tickets for&nbsp;$11.</p>
<p>Even after 20 years in the States,
I still know next to nothing about baseball.
I picked up a copy of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.baseballfieldguide.com/">Baseball Field Guide</a>
before last year&#8217;s Irish Night,
and found the first chapter very helpful in explaining the basics.
I re-read it last night and it helped me follow tonight&#8217;s&nbsp;game.</p>
<p>Neither the Mariners nor the White Sox could score a run.
Inning after inning the game went on, zero-zero.
No one had scored by the bottom of the ninth, so play continued.
A tenth inning.
An eleventh.
