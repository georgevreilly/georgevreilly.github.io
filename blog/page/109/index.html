    <p>It's no secret that Bush is ap&shy;palling&shy;ly vacuous and incoherent whenever he
has to answer a question that he hasn't been prepped for. Here are a few
excerpts from his recent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/04/20060410-1.html">appearance at Johns Hopkins University</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Presidency Is No Place for a Smart person</strong></p>
<blockquote>
We're a in&shy;flu&shy;en&shy;tial nation, and so, therefore, many problems come
to the Oval Office. And you don't know what those problems are
going to be, which then argues for having smart people around.
That's why you ought to serve in government if you're not going to
be the President. You have a chance to influence policy by giving
good rec&shy;om&shy;men&shy;da&shy;tions to the President.</blockquote>

<p>Ever since the advent of commercial television, ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ers have
wondered exactly what they get for the megabucks they spend on
30-second spots. After all, the networks and cable companies offer only
a crude ap&shy;prox&shy;i&shy;ma&shy;tion of who is watching what. With such thin
in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion, ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ers can't target specific neigh&shy;bor&shy;hoods or
consumer tastes. As for converting ads directly to sales, well, that's
virtually impossible. Yet the Web, with its so&shy;phis&shy;ti&shy;cat&shy;ed per-click
metrics, does all of that billions of times a day. &quot;The problem,&quot; says

    <p>I often complain about being busy, no doubt because I have a talent for
com&shy;pli&shy;cat&shy;ing my life. Things were relatively quiet for a while, but that's
not true anymore.</p>
<p>At work, we're close to releasing the first version of our product.
Happily, crunch time at Atlas isn't nearly as bad as it was at Microsoft.
Instead of working eight-ish hours a day, it's more like nine or maybe ten.
The pressure level has risen, of course, but it's far from in&shy;tol&shy;er&shy;a&shy;ble.</p>
<p>The real busyness is in my ex&shy;tracur&shy;ric&shy;u&shy;lar life. I'm the president of

    <p>I was born 41 years ago today.
(Tech&shy;ni&shy;cal&shy;ly, yesterday, as it's now the early hours of March 16th.)
I was to have been called Vincent after my father,
but my mother's father, George Victor Clery,
had died just 12 days before.
I was baptised George Vincent Reilly on March 17th, St. Patrick's Day.</p>
<p>Beware the Ides of March, I tell people:
You might have to buy George a present.
Better a birthday present than the reception
that Julius Caesar received on
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_Of_March">March 15th, 44BC</a>.</p>

but I've never disliked it enough to do anything about it.
