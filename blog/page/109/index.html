    <p>My brother David sent me this photo earlier today, of
me, him, and Michelle. I’m guessing that Michelle is less than a year old,
so it was taken sometime in 1971, which would make David four and me six.
(Our youngest brother, Mark, wasn’t born until 1973.)</p>

<p>Emma thinks we’re adorable and has already made this picture her desktop
background on her work computer.</p>
<p>Mark has another photo of the four of us, taken in 1978
on his website, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.alienresident.net/">alien­res­i­dent.net</a>:</p>

<p>Joe Lieberman, the 2000 vice-pres­i­den­tial nominee, lost the Democratic primary
for his Senate seat tonight. He has said that he will run as an in­de­pen­dent.
In effect, he will not accept the will of the people.</p>
<p>Lieberman lost, in part, because of his continuing refusal to admit that
the Iraq war is a disaster, and in part because he has been a leading
enabler of the Republican agenda. Good riddance!</p>

<p>Well, fuck! The Washington State Supreme Court handed down its long-awaited decision
today on the con­sti­tion­al­i­ty of the state’s Defense of Marriage Act.
Somehow, they found that it didn’t violate the state con­sti­tu­tion’s Equal
Protection clause.</p>
<p>No same-sex marriages in Washington state anytime soon.</p>
<p>I attended the <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/279042_samesex27.html">rally at the First Baptist church</a>
earlier this evening. (Find me in the photo!)
Some anger, some dis­ap­point­ment. Mostly upbeat.
The young Latina couple were very affecting.
The Serkin-Pooles invited everyone to join their club,
as they announced their formal engagement to each other.
One speaker pointed out that even if the court had handed down a favorable
decision, the process would not have been over.</p>

<p>I hadn’t really planned to visit Ireland this year, but then my sister
Michelle phoned the other day to say that her boyfriend, David Bowles, had
just proposed to her. Not a big surprise. They had moved in together
earlier this year, and we were all assuming that it was a question of when,
not if.</p>
<p>They plan to get married quite soon, as his father has been given
six-to-nine months to live, and they want him to be at the wedding. I don’t
know if the date is firm yet, but the latest that I’m hearing is November-11th.</p>

Lau is a triad who joined the cops about ten years ago,

Only their respective bosses, Su­per­in­ten­dant Wong and Big Sam, know who they are.
Each becomes aware of the other about the same time,
and the chase to find the moles is on.</p>
<p>It’s a tense and complex thriller and a meditation on good and evil.
Yan has long blurred the line between cop and gangster.
