<p>Emma and I are going to spend most of June and all of July 2015 in Berlin.</p>
<p>Two years ago, our friend Joanna announced that she was going to spend a year in Paris
with her husband and daughters.
This got us thinking about spending a year in Europe ourselves.
After con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;ing Bilbao and some other cities, we eventually decided upon Berlin.
We had both studied German in high school or college;
Berlin is a vibrant cultural city, full of history and art;
it's a tech hub and a startup magnet;
and it's con&shy;ve&shy;nient&shy;ly located for travel within Europe.</p>
<p>We spent a week there last year in early August, <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2015/05/24/ABerlinSummer.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I woke up this morning to the news that
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.liberties.eu/en/news/irish-marriage-equality-referendum">Ireland's referendum on Marriage Equality</a>
looked set to pass with a strong majority.
Tears began running down my face as I read the reports
of con&shy;stituen&shy;cy after con&shy;stituen&shy;cy voted &quot;Yes&quot;.
I'm crying again as I write this.</p>
<p>When I was growing up as a bisexual teenager in Dublin
in the late 1970s and early '80s—out to no-one but myself—it was hard to imagine a day like this.
Hardly anyone then had the fortitude to live openly as gay,
if they could pass for straight.
Queers and pansies and poofs were objects of derision and occasional violence.
It wasn't until after I emigrated

<p>Fifteenth book in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files">Dresden Files</a>
series of urban fantasies.</p>
<p>Harry Dresden is Chicago's only pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al wizard
and the Winter Knight to Queen Mab.
Mab compels him to team up with one of his old enemies to rob an im&shy;preg&shy;nable vault,
a vault that belongs to Hades, lord of the Underworld.
Harry distrusts Nicode&shy;mus—right&shy;ful&shy;ly, as Nicodemus turns on him.
But Harry can stab backs too.</p>
<p>A solid entry in this long running series.
Harry is in&shy;creas&shy;ing&shy;ly careworn but he still cracks wise,
en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing the readers if not his an&shy;tag&shy;o&shy;nists.</p>

but what could the link between the two men be?
One of the victims left a half-written letter addressed to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/12/31/ReviewRiverOfDarkness.aspx">John Madden</a>,
who is now retired from Scotland Yard.
Soon there are more victims and Madden and the police struggle to find the killer.</p>
<p>Airth evokes both the First and Second World Wars,
exploring the damage done to those who survived
and the injustices visited upon some who did not.</p>

<p>Two mysteries are in&shy;ter&shy;twined in this novel.
In the present day, a long-lost diary of Arthur Conan Doyle's from 1900
has apparently been re&shy;dis&shy;cov&shy;ered,
but the finder has been murdered,
while in 1900, Doyle and Bram Stoker in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gate the murder of several young women.</p>
<p>The two mysteries are artfully in&shy;ter&shy;twined and the plots move along nicely.
I was irritated by the author's ignorance of Victorian England—&quot;It was a Victorian-era shilling, worth only five pennies in its day&quot;
(twelve, dammit, until dec&shy;i&shy;mal&shy;i&shy;sa&shy;tion in 1971)—and weak grasp of ACD's style.</p>

<p>Macbeth is an honorable Scottish lord who serves an ignoble king.
When Malcolm finally goes too far,
Macbeth and his wife convince themselves that Malcolm must die.
(Encounters with a trio of strange women also swayed their minds.)
Macbeth himself becomes king but guilt and paranoia
start eating away at him and his wife.</p>
<p>Hartley and Hewson retell Shake&shy;speare's classic play as a novel,
providing psy&shy;cho&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal motivation for Macbeth's usurpation and downfall.
Their Lady Macbeth is more sym&shy;pa&shy;thet&shy;ic and less nakedly ambitious
than she is usually portrayed.</p>
