    <p>Emma is once again at the <a class="reference external" href="http://madronafiberarts.com/">Madrona Fiber Arts Festival</a> in Tacoma.
It's a convention of knitters, crocheters,
and prac&shy;ti&shy;tion&shy;ers of other fiber arts,
and Emma goes every year.
She takes classes and hangs out with her fellow knitters.
It's always held over Valen&shy;tine's Day Weekend,
so I tease her about preferring knitting to romantic dinners with me.</p>

<p>Recently married, Lord Peter Wimsey and the former Harriet Vane
take up residence at their townhouse.
When the beautiful wife of an ac&shy;quain&shy;tance is murdered,
Peter becomes involved in the in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion.
Meanwhile, Harriet is coming to terms with having &quot;married up&quot;,
after fending off Peter's wooing for several years.
Should she continue her career as a mystery novelist,
now that she no longer needs the income,
or do what is expected by some: have babies and give up writing.

One of the few shows that I do watch is <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters">Myth&shy;Busters</a>,
sadly now in its last season.
I watched three old shows tonight,

making a lead balloon.</p>
<p>Taking on the adage &quot;to go down like a lead balloon&quot;,
Jamie and Adam set out to prove that it is possible
to make a lead balloon fly.
But it's not easy.</p>
<p>After pro&shy;to&shy;typ&shy;ing a couple of designs with aluminum foil, they move on to lead foil.
Lead foil is very hard to obtain and it's much weaker than aluminum foil.
Jamie likens it to working with wet toilet paper,

<p>I half-watched team sports <em>twice</em> today.
We got up early to go to an Irish friend's house,
to eat a full Irish breakfast and watch rugby.
I no longer detest rugby with the virulence that I had growing up,
when I attended a rugby-playing school in Dublin from ages 7 to 18,
but I'm still not interested in the game.</p>
<p>This afternoon, I went to a Chinese New Year's party,
which doubled as a Superbowl party.
I trans&shy;ferred my feelings about rugby to American football when I moved here.
I have many problems with football culture:
the worship of jocks, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steubenville_High_School_rape_case">rape culture</a>, homophobia, concussion.

<p>I assembled a couple of adjustable shelving units today.
Trying to count the same number of in&shy;den&shy;ta&shy;tions on all four legs for each level
quickly grew tedious, and I realized that I needed to make a story stick.
I cut a &quot;stick&quot; to the right length
and then I was able to place the stick along the leg
and instantly read where the next pair of snap rings should be placed.
I mentioned this to Emma and she had never heard of story sticks.</p>
<p>Wood&shy;work&shy;ers have used <a class="reference external" href="http://www.startwoodworking.com/post/using-story-sticks-build-furniture">story sticks</a> for a long time

<p>I've driven Car2go a couple of times this week.
On both occasions, while driving through downtown Seattle,
the car announced that I was outside its home area.
Presumably it tem&shy;porar&shy;i&shy;ly lost a signal
and thereby assumed that it was no longer in the home area.
Given the car knew my position and direction just moments before,
and that I was well inside the home area,
any half-way decent algorithm would have concluded
that it was physically impossible for me to be now outside the home area,
and kept its mouth shut.</p>

a young lady called Victoria Dawes travels from England to Al&shy;bu&shy;querque
to seek the aid of Cora Oglesby, the now-retired monster hunter.
The women draw the attention of a Navajo skinwalker and a vampire,

Under Cora's sarcastic tough love tutelage,
Miss Dawes grows from a sheltered Victorian lady into a semi-capable fighter.</p>

<p>Cora Oglesby and her husband Ben have been slaying monsters
and slinging guns all over the Old West for years,
ever since the Civil War ended.
In a bitterly cold winter,
on the outskirts of a silver-mining town in Colorado,
they take down a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendigo">wendigo</a> and then a nest of vampires.</p>
<p>Cora is tough and hardened and takes no crap from anyone, man or monster.
But she's damaged too, more than we realize at first.
I thought the first-time author did a decent job

<p>I've played many roles at <a class="reference external" href="http://freelyspeaking.org/">Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters</a>
over the last twelve years, but I've never before chaired a contest.</p>
<p>Every spring, Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters runs the In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al Speech and Evaluation Contests.
In the autumn, the Humorous Speech and Table Topics Contests are held.
The contests are held in most clubs;
each club's winners advance to the area contests;
thence to the division contest;
and finally to the district contest.</p>
<p>I've par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pat&shy;ed in each of the contests in the past,
making it to the area contests and oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly the division.
I'm not competing this spring,
so I'm going to run our club's contest instead.</p>
