<p>How has America come to this? Is the United States of America truly

<p>This is foul. This is wholly un-American. This is deeply immoral.
Every civilized society abhors&nbsp;torture.</p>
<p>How can we claim to be spreading Democracy in the Middle East at the

<p>I ran into a problem installing some <span class="caps">COM</span>+ components today. The installer
was using <a class="reference external" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/04za0hca.aspx">Regsvcs.exe</a>
to register each <span class="caps">COM</span>+ component. I noticed after a while that the installer
wasn&#8217;t making any progress and that my dual-proc system was stuck at 50%
<span class="caps">CPU</span> uti&shy;liza&shy;tion. I attached a debugger to the offending process, regsvcs,
and found that it was stuck in the following infinite loop

<p>Nine-Eleven. The date burned into everyone&#8217;s brain. One of those dates
where everyone remembers where they were when they heard the news.
Emma and I awoke to the radio telling us that planes had crashed into the
World Trade Center. We went downstairs and watched the <span class="caps">TV</span> in&nbsp;horror.</p>
<p>For a time, an all-too-brief time, the country pulled together
in a show of unity and grief. The world joined us in an outpouring of&nbsp;support.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why history will condemn George Bush, but one of the
most serious is his squan&shy;der&shy;ing that good will for quick partisan
advantage. A better man could have built a bipartisan consensus <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/09/12/2006911.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>As I mentioned last month,
I par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pat&shy;ed in this year&#8217;s <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Walk on&nbsp;Saturday.</p>
<p>I raised over <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lifelongevents.org/site/TR?px=1013411&amp;pg=personal&amp;fr_id=1080">$1300 online</a>,
handily exceeding my goal of $1,000.
I also raised another $300 in cash and checks at the fundrais&shy;ing barbecue
that we threw on September&nbsp;1st.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lost count, but I believe that in the last 15 years, I&#8217;ve raised about
$10,000 for charity. Most of it has been for the Northwest <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Walk.
The last few years that I was at Microsoft,
I raised $2,000-$3,000 each year, thanks to the power of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/citizenship/giving/programs/employee.asp">Microsoft matching</a>,
which doubled the amount of money that I raised.
I&#8217;ve also raised money two years running for

<p>My colleague, Greg, and I spent all day debugging a build break in
some unit tests that exercise a webservice interface in legacy .<span class="caps">NET</span> 1.1 code.
Last night, the tests stopped working on our

<p>The only thing that had changed in the code tree was that another

shared the same <span class="caps">GUID</span>, and had repaired that. <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/09/02/UpgradeYourInstallationOfNAnt.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>In mid-July, most of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.WorkForAtlas.com">Atlas Solutions</a>
developer teams moved from
our old offices at Fifth and Jackson in the In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al District
four blocks west to swanky offices in Pioneer Square.
The new offices are at the State building on the corner of
Occidental and Main, the pedes&shy;tri&shy;an&shy;ized block
with the antique stores and art galleries.
Occidental Park across the street has been re&shy;fur&shy;bished.
There are three coffee shops within two blocks,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/">Elliott Bay Books</a>
is one block west of us.
It&#8217;s all very pleasant, with the exception of the large
number of homeless&nbsp;people.</p>

<p>I spent far too much time on Friday trying to make <a class="reference external" href="https://logging.apache.org/log4net/">log4net</a> work in a <span class="caps">COM</span>+&nbsp;ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion.</p>
<p>Someone else had done part of the work necessary,
by creating an <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/florinlazar/archive/2003/12/04/41369.aspx">ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion.config</a> for the <span class="caps">COM</span>+ ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion
and setting a custom Ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion Root Directory.
This was enough to ensure that most of the managed code in the ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion
got their con&shy;fig&shy;u&shy;ra&shy;tion settings;
log4net being the&nbsp;exception.</p>
<p>It took some additional work to realize that we needed to add two assembly&nbsp;attributes:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[assembly: log4net.Config.Repository(&quot;unique-name&quot;)]
[assembly: log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator(ConfigFile=&quot;application.config&quot;)]
</pre>
<p>The repository name just needs to be a unique string.
We used the name of the&nbsp;assembly.</p>

<p>This year is the 20th an&shy;niver&shy;sary of the Northwest <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Walk.
A whole generation has passed.
Twenty years ago, <span class="caps">AIDS</span> was considered a gay man&#8217;s disease and a death sentence.
The <span class="caps">U.S.</span> government was just beginning to ac&shy;knowl&shy;edge the existence of <span class="caps">AIDS</span>,
half a decade after it had first been recognized by health au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ties,
and thousands had&nbsp;died.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AIDS</span> is still a serious problem,
but the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of an&shy;ti&shy;retro&shy;vi&shy;ral drugs a decade ago
means that people with <span class="caps">HIV</span> are living longer,
healthier lives than before.
More than 1 million Americans are now living with <span class="caps">HIV</span>/<span class="caps">AIDS</span>:
9,000 of them in King County.
40,000 people are infected every year in the U.S.,
