<p>My eight-month experiment in daily blogging will go on hiatus for a few days.
We fly out tonight and I will have only in&shy;ter&shy;mit&shy;tent Internet access
for the next three weeks in Spain and Ireland.</p>
<p>It's possible that I'll write a daily post,
but I often won't be able to post im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly.</p>

at the Seward Park Am&shy;phithe&shy;ater.
Six of us braved the rain last night,
ate our picnic, and enjoyed an hour and a half of ribald slapstick.</p>
<p>Almost all of the cast cross-dressed.
The main male parts, the two sets of identical twin brothers, were played by women,
The wife, her sister, and the courtesan were played by ugly men
in the best <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantomime_dame">panto dame</a> tradition.</p>
<p>The play, like so many of Shake&shy;speare's comedies,
requires an endless series of confused identities,

<p>We're off to Spain and Ireland tomorrow evening,
so lots of last-minute prepa&shy;ra&shy;tions tonight.
I laid out my clothes on the spare bed on Sunday;
Emma picked out hers this evening.
I've just paid some bills and I'm trans&shy;fer&shy;ring files onto the netbook that I'm bringing.</p>
<p>I still have to whittle down the large pile of books that are under con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion.
I don't want to run out before we get to Ireland,
but I don't want to take too many.
Depending on what else is going on,
I'll get through a book in a day or two when I'm on vacation.
Maybe two books on those long plane flights.</p>

<p>Two picnics this weekend.</p>
<p>Today we held the tenth annual <a class="reference external" href="http://www.binetseattle.org/">BiNet Seattle</a> picnic for the bisexual community,
which I once again organized, with some help from Emma.
Almost all of the preceding ones were held at Ravenna Park.
Even though I booked the picnic back in March,
Ravenna Park was un&shy;avail&shy;able this weekend,
which was the only weekend that really suited me.
We went to Golden Gardens Beach instead.
It's a nice park, but parking is atrocious on a busy weekend,
which may explain the poor turnout.
There were only 10 people, down from 20–30 for the last few years.
Three new faces; the rest were regulars.
As usual, Emma and I <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/07/12/Picnics.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>For weeks, Lyn has been telling us about the musical talk that
he was going to give today at his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rvuuc.org/">UU con&shy;gre&shy;ga&shy;tion</a>
about <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Strayhorn">Billy Strayhorn</a>, a little-known but talented composer,
who col&shy;lab&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ed for decades with Duke Ellington.
Strayhorn was openly gay in the homophobic decades before Stonewall.
That, coupled with his apparent liking for remaining in Elling&shy;ton's shadow,
probably con&shy;tributed to his obscurity.</p>
<p>Lyn talked about Billy Strayhorn and his life and music for half an hour.
He also ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;nied Shirley singing some Strayhorn songs on piano,
as Linda and Marion played the clarinet and cello.
He said that Stray&shy;horn's life gives rise to two questions,

<p>I mentioned <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/06/20/WhenVideoCardsGoBad.aspx">three weeks ago</a> that I had just repaved my work dev box
and installed the 64-bit version of the Windows&nbsp;7&nbsp;RC.
Nine or ten years after I first ported parts of IIS to Win64,
I am finally running my main desktop on 64-bit Windows.
With one exception, it's been painless.
Programs have just worked, devices have just worked.
There are relatively few native x64 ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions,
but for the most part it doesn't matter.
The cases where it does matter—e.g., shell extensions such as <a class="reference external" href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">Tor&shy;tois&shy;eSVN</a>—are available as 64-bit binaries.</p>
<p>I briefly flirted with using the 64-bit build of Python,

<p>We held our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/07/08/HealthCareNowRallyOnThursday.aspx">rally</a> for healthcare and the public option at lunchtime,
outside the Jackson Federal Building
where both Senators Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray
have their Seattle offices.</p>
<p>Turnout was good: about 100 people, I'd say.
We had about half-a-dozen speakers over 45 minutes.
A cameraman from King–5 covered it, but I can't find anything on their website.
A handful of people went upstairs to the senators' offices
and delivered 291&nbsp;pages of petitions.</p>
<p>One concrete suggestion that I came away with
is to write a <em>hand&shy;writ&shy;ten</em> letter to the senators
advocating for healthcare reform.
Hand&shy;writ&shy;ten letters carry more weight than printed letters or calls
and much more weight than emails.</p>
<p>Do it soon.

<p>We're traveling to Spain and Ireland for three weeks.
I'm bringing the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/04/25/UbuntuNetbookRemix904.aspx">netbook</a>, not the 17&quot;&nbsp;MacBook Pro, because it's small and light.
It doesn't have a DVD player and I'd like to bring some DVDs to watch.
I could either spend about $80 on an external DVD player,
or I could rip the DVDs beforehand.</p>
<p>I've ripped a few DVDs with <a class="reference external" href="http://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a>,
an open source, cross-platform video transcoder,
which seems to do a good job.
I'm playing them in the cross-platform <a class="reference external" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> player,
which released version 1.0.0 yesterday, after almost 8&nbsp;years of de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, a group of us <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/06/27/TalkingToSenatorsAboutHealthcareReform.aspx">visited our senators' offices</a>
to talk to their staffers about the Public Option in health care.
We're organizing a downtown Seattle rally at the Federal Building on Thursday at 12:15pm,
where both Senators Cantwell and Murray have their offices.
It's one of the large number of rallies that <a class="reference external" href="http://pol.moveon.org/event/events/index.html?action_id=180">MoveOn.org is organizing</a>
at senators' offices all around the country on Thursday.</p>

She had sent a letter predicting that her husband would murder her.
The couple were from a lower-class, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonconformism">Non&shy;con&shy;formist</a> background.
