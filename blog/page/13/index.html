<p>A disparate group of necro&shy;mancer hunters and artists are trekking through the desert.
They're out of food and the artists must compete not to be eaten by the strongmen
by telling stories by the campfire.
It's the Canterbury Tales crossed with Scheherazade.
The narrator shows how he skillfully and shame&shy;less&shy;ly ma&shy;nip&shy;u&shy;lat&shy;ed the various parties.
His stories within stories sow doubt and dissension.
There's black humor and art criticism and enough suspense to keep you going,
once you get past the in&shy;ter&shy;minable beginning.</p>

    <p>I needed to import some plugin code written in Python
from a directory whose path isn't known until runtime.
Further, I needed a class object that was a subclass of the plugin base class.</p>

<pre class="brush: python">
from somewhere import PluginBase

class SomePlugin(PluginBase):

<p>You can use the <a class="reference external" href="https://pymotw.com/2/imp/">imp</a> module to actually load the module from <tt class="docutils literal">impl_dir</tt>.
Note that <tt class="docutils literal">impl_dir</tt> needs to be tem&shy;porar&shy;i&shy;ly prepended to <tt class="docutils literal">sys.path</tt>.

    <p>It's better to stay calm when things aren't going well.
Stress and panic are contagious.
When you're broad&shy;cast&shy;ing stress or panic on all channels,
other people start picking it up.
If you can keep your cool, others are more likely to remain calm too.
Often that's for the best,
but sometimes it backfires
because others in&shy;cor&shy;rect&shy;ly believe that everything is still okay.</p>
<p>Knowing when to ask for help is an art.
You learn a lot when you persevere and try different things,
many of which may fail.
The failures will likely show you where your un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing is deficient;
you learn some of the many ways in which things can go wrong.

    <p>I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/02/01/ToastmastersContestChair.html">mentioned</a> a few weeks ago that I was going to be the Contest Chair

at <a class="reference external" href="http://freelyspeaking.org/">Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters</a>.
Those contests were tonight,
and I was both Contest Chair and Toast&shy;mas&shy;ter.
The contest chair sets up everything be&shy;fore&shy;hand;
the toast&shy;mas&shy;ter runs the contest itself;
frequently but not nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;i&shy;ly the contest chair is also the toast&shy;mas&shy;ter.</p>
<p>I'm happy with how it came off.
I managed to recruit two speakers for the Speech contest
and three evaluators for the Evaluation contest,
all of whom acquitted themselves well.
I also recruited three judges, two ballot counters, one timer,
a sergeant at arms, and a test speaker
to make the contest <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/02/29/" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

it reminded me that I've been meaning to write
about the hit-or-miss nature of adapting books for the screen.</p>
<p>Books and video/film are different media,
with different con&shy;ven&shy;tions and needs.
Often the most-loved elements of a book are lost
when it's adapted for television or film,
upsetting fans.</p>
<p>As J.K. Rowling wrote about one of the Harry Potter movies:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;It is simply impossible to in&shy;cor&shy;po&shy;rate every one of my storylines
into a film that has to be kept under four hours long.
Obviously films have re&shy;stric&shy;tions

<blockquote>
<p>From a cryp&shy;to&shy;graph&shy;ic standpoint, PGP is rock solid.
In practice, using it is very messy.
Its complexity has deterred the vast majority of people
who might otherwise benefit from using encryption.</p>
<p>The first problem is es&shy;tab&shy;lish&shy;ing a valid identity,
especially with other people located oceans away.
The second is dis&shy;trib&shy;ut&shy;ing public keys
without nefarious types posting al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tive keys
that appear to be registered to the same person.

The third issue is getting people to install and use PGP software.</p>

Dennis left a pregnant Libby (Thandie Newton) at the altar five years ago.
Now he's an overweight security guard in a London lingerie shop

Whit (Hank Azaria) is well off, handsome, and very fit.
Somehow Dennis ends up promising to run in a marathon in three weeks' time

<p>The Coen Brothers' latest movie, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail,_Caesar!">Hail, Caesar!</a>, is a lot of fun.
I've been looking forward to it since the trailers showed up a few months ago.
It's a homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood,
an age where quirky talents like the Coens
could not have made Coen Brothers' movies.
We see song and dance numbers, syn&shy;chro&shy;nized swimming,
singing cowboys, and ballroom dramas.
Most of all, we see a big-budget swords-and-sandals epic,
whose star, Baird Whitlock, has been kidnapped by The Future,
a group of Communist screen&shy;writ&shy;ers,
and is being held for $100,000 ransom.

<p>Both Trump and Cruz scare me, for very different reasons.
Trump is impulsive, all id, doesn't give a fuck,
