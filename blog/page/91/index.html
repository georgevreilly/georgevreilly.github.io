<p>Nine-Eleven. The date burned into everyone's brain. One of those dates
where everyone remembers where they were when they heard the news.
Emma and I awoke to the radio telling us that planes had crashed into the
World Trade Center. We went downstairs and watched the TV in horror.</p>
<p>For a time, an all-too-brief time, the country pulled together
in a show of unity and grief. The world joined us in an outpouring of
support.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why history will condemn George Bush, but one of the
most serious is his squan&shy;der&shy;ing that good will for quick partisan
advantage. A better man could have built a bipartisan <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/09/12/2006911.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>My brother David sent me this photo earlier today, of
me, him, and Michelle. I'm guessing that Michelle is less than a year old,
so it was taken sometime in 1971, which would make David four and me six.
(Our youngest brother, Mark, wasn't born until 1973.)</p>

<p>Emma thinks we're adorable and has already made this picture her desktop
background on her work computer.</p>
<p>Mark has another photo of the four of us, taken in 1978
on his website, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.alienresident.net/">alien&shy;res&shy;i&shy;dent.net</a>:</p>

<p>In the 1980s, in order to solidify their shift from divorce to
abortion, the Religious Right con&shy;struct&shy;ed an <em>abortion myth</em>, one
accepted by most Americans as true. Simply put, the abortion myth is
this: Leaders of the Religious Right would have us believe that their
movement began in direct response to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973
<em>Roe v. Wade</em> decision. Po&shy;lit&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tive evan&shy;gel&shy;i&shy;cal leaders were so
morally outraged by the ruling that they instantly shed their

we went to see Al Gore's new doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary on global climate change,

<p>Gore lays out a compelling case that global climate change is real,
that it's been happening for decades, and that it's spiralling out of
control. He backs it up with plenty of statistics and graphs.</p>

full beard. This has ne&shy;ces&shy;si&shy;tat&shy;ed shaving, and I've been using those
disposable Bic razors. I haven't been very happy with them. They left my
face feeling like I had been making out with a cheese grater.</p>
<p>I bought one of those new five-bladed <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gillettefusion.com/us/">Fusion razors</a> yesterday and shaved with it this
morning. Oh my! Very smooth!</p>
<p>I'm convinced that five blades is marketing hokum and that five blades is
probably not really better than four blades. Or three blades. But five
blades is certainly better than one.</p>
