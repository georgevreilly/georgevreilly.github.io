<p>A Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters meeting has three parts:
prepared speeches, table topics, and eval&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tions of the prepared speeches.</p>
<p>Table Topics offer a chance for those present
to wing it on some topic for one or two minutes.
The Table Topics Master sets up the topics
and the speaker has as most a few minutes to prepare.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I'm running Table Topics,
I present a topic for everyone at the beginning of the section.
On a winter's day, I might ask people to tell us about
some favorite food they associate with winter.
Or I might ask them to tell us about where they're going for their summer vacation.</p>

<p>Anathem takes place on Arbre,
a world where those of an in&shy;tel&shy;lec&shy;tu&shy;al bent
sequester themselves in monas&shy;ter&shy;ies apart from the Sæcular world.
When an alien ship is noticed orbiting the planet,
avout from concents all over Arbre are drawn together for a Convox
to determine how to respond to the threat of the Geometers.</p>
<p>Stephen&shy;son's <em>Anathem</em> is an ambitious project,
pulling together physics, meta&shy;physics, world-building, an&shy;thro&shy;pol&shy;o&shy;gy,
and an adventure tale.
It's an alien world as he keeps reminding us
by the huge vocabulary he's invented.
Said vocabulary alternates between ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ing and en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing,

<p>I wrote yesterday about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/04/11/NTFS3GTheUniversalFilesystem.aspx">NTFS-3G</a> because I was backing my MacBook
to an external NTFS drive.
I was backing up because I wanted to de-partition my Mac.</p>
<p>When I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/07/16/MacBookMakeover.aspx">upgraded my MacBook</a> to a bigger drive, more RAM, and OS&nbsp;X 10.5,
I par&shy;ti&shy;tioned the drive.
I created two 25GB partitions with the intention of
putting Windows and Linux on them with BootCamp.
It turns out that BootCamp doesn't like that.
It wants the system drive to have only one partition,
which it would shrink.
I never bothered to go any further.</p>
<p>The disk has been filling up recently and I wanted the extra space back,
to extend my primary HFS+ partition by <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/04/12/DepartitioningAMacDisk.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>After I started running Linux and then Mac OS X, in addition to Windows,
I started on a quest to find the universal filesystem.
I had multiboot systems and external drives where I wanted to
to be able to read and write disks under multiple operating systems.</p>
<p>The obvious choice is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table#FAT32">FAT32</a>,
the ubiquitous, lowest-common de&shy;nom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tor filesystem.
FAT32 is supported out-of-the-box by
all major operating systems, digital cameras, and PDAs,
so that's a huge advantage.
FAT32 also has major short&shy;com&shy;ings:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Maximum file size is 4GB. I have ISOs, MPEGs, and other large files exceeding this limit.</li>
<li>Frag&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion happens too easily.</li>
<li>Timestamps: accurate only to 2-second resolution. No notion of timezones or UTC.</li>

<p>New post to the Cozi Tech Blog:

<p>Using an iframe to host some content turned out to be a big pain,

<p>As I mentioned the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/04/06/CirceSecondDraft.aspx">other night</a>,
I introduced two narrators into the chapter of Ulysses
that we're reading in June.</p>
<p>I'd say from the rehearsal tonight that the additions are successful,
that they clarify the text for the listener,
without being intrusive.
I expect that I'll have to produce a third draft of the script in a few weeks,
but I think the next round of changes will be minor.
The second draft required hundreds of small changes.</p>
<p>We gained three new readers tonight.
There are plenty of parts to go around, so it's all to the good.
We had great difficulty initially last year in
getting enough readers from the old <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/04/08/NarratorsInCirce.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>On Friday, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/04/04/IowaGayMarriageRuling.aspx">Iowa Supreme Court</a> struck down their state's
gay marriage ban.

<p>It's been a great week for fairness.
We still have a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20090407/NEWS03/90407022">long way to go</a>:
29 states have con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&shy;al amendments banning gay marriage.</p>
<p>I'm sure the right wing are beating the fund-raising drums for all they're worth.
We can expect more Propo&shy;si&shy;tion 8-style backlashes, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>But the news still made my day.</p>

<p>Moments ago, I completed the second draft of the Circe Part I script
for this year's Ulysses reading.</p>
<p>The chapter is couched in the form of a play,
making it relatively straight&shy;for&shy;ward to convert to a staged reading.
There are, however, huge numbers of “stage di&shy;rec&shy;tion&shy;s”,
often ironic, generally unactable:
A vast, detailed procession in Bloom's honor;
Bloom burning at the stake;
camels offering mangoes to Molly;
and much, much more.</p>
<p>In addition, there are over one hundred characters,
most of whom have a line or two, then disappear.
They need to be introduced somehow.</p>
<p>So I added two narrators to handle all of this.
They steer the reading along,
adding much-needed context to aid <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/04/06/CirceSecondDraft.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>In Seattle, it is said that moss grows on the north side of the rain.
To be sure, moss thrives in the shadier parts of our yard.</p>
<p>On a cold, dry February day,
I rented a pressure washer with the intention
of scouring the moss from the ground
and the flaking paint from the garage walls.
Although it was quite effective at removing moss,
it made a godawful mess.
There were muddy flecks of moss everywhere.
Against the flaking paint, it made little impression
and I still have to deal with that.
I had dealt with perhaps a third of the moss
when the pressure washer died.
I got a partial refund, but <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/04/06/RemovingMoss.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>It's been a long, dreary winter in Seattle.
After a horrible, wet Saturday,
last Sunday was glorious, the first nice day in weeks.
Then the cold and rain came back.
It snowed on April 1st, for Pete's sake.</p>
<p>And now we have another lovely weekend,
with promised highs in the high Sixties tomorrow.
I did some yard work today
and cleaned the grill and outdoor furniture.
We've invited a handful of friends over for dinner tomorrow night.</p>
