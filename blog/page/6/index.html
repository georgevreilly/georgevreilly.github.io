<p>I made a number of updates to the <a class="reference external" href="http://flyingcloud.readthedocs.io/">Fly&shy;ing&shy;Cloud Doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion</a> tonight.
I hope to give a lightning talk about Fly&shy;ing&shy;Cloud
at PyCon on Monday evening or Tuesday morning,
and I put together some slides for that too.</p>

<p>We drove down to Portland, Oregon yesterday for <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2016/">PyCon</a>.
No trip to Portland would be complete without a trip to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.powells.com/">Powell's bookstore</a>.
I don't have much time this trip, but we did manage to spend an hour there last night,
before they closed at 11pm.
There's nothing like it in Seattle.
I like Elliott Bay Bookstore but it's a pale shadow of Powell's.
A long time ago, someone described Powell's to me as “the best bookstore in Seat&shy;tle”—mean&shy;ing that Seat&shy;tleites who want to visit a world-class bookstore
have to visit Portland.</p>
<p>I got out lightly.
I spent only $85.</p>

<p>Five astronauts are stranded on Mars.
Their only hope is to find the vehicle of an earlier crew who died—but that ship is at the north pole and they're south of the equator.
And so they trek north across Mars.
They know that the other ship can't hold them all,
and some of them start dying along the way.</p>
<p>Landis is a NASA scientist who writes “<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_science_fiction">hard science fiction</a>”;
i.e., SF that's solidly based in science,
some of which is known for plodding writing and dull characters.

    <p>Our poster designer sent me a PDF of this year's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2016.html">Bloomsday poster</a>.
I thought the file was too large at 7.2MB and I wanted to reduce the file size
without sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant loss of image quality.
I was unable to achieve this in Preview or Acrobat Reader,
but Ghost&shy;script did the trick,
thanks to an answer on <a class="reference external" href="http://askubuntu.com/a/256449/956">AskUbuntu</a>:</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://komonews.com/news/local/downtown-seattle-hit-by-major-power-outage">power suddenly went out</a> at work today about 11:30am.
There was a technician who was running wires,
standing on a ladder next to us,
who disclaimed all re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty.
Since the wires were Ethernet cables, we believed him.
It quickly became apparent that it was not just our office or even our building,
but many blocks of downtown Seattle that had lost power.
One person was trapped in the elevator in our old Pioneer Square building.
Within half an hour, everyone had left the office.
Although most of us have laptops,
no elec&shy;tric&shy;i&shy;ty meant no Internet.
I drifted up to Capitol Hill and spent the afternoon

<p>I spent a couple of frus&shy;trat&shy;ing hours this evening
trying to figure out an easy way to deploy a Docker container on AWS.
I tried out the <a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">EC2 Container Service</a> and got lost
in a sea of Clusters, Tasks, and Services.
I couldn't connect to the EC2 instance where my container supposedly lived.</p>
<p>I tried <a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Elastic Beanstalk</a> and gave up in ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;a&shy;tion.
When you create a new Docker en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment,
there's no way to pull an existing image from an external repo
that I could see.
We have some tools for deploying a Docker image to Elastic Beanstalk,
but they were so cryptic that I didn't want to pursue that.</p>

<p>Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters teaches three skillsets.
By far the best known is public speaking,
but evaluation and leadership are also valuable.
Learning to evaluate a speech teaches you to listen carefully
and to give useful feedback.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/speech-evaluation-3-modified-sandwich-technique/">Toast&shy;mas&shy;ter&shy;s' Sandwich</a> is the best-known approach:
point out several things the speaker did well,
suggest some areas of im&shy;prove&shy;ment,
and conclude with more praise.</p>
<p>The evaluator benefits too from the evaluation,
as they hone their listening and critical skills
and as they learn to give helpful feedback.
The audience also benefits,
as they hear both the speech
and a measured response to the speech.</p>
<p>Outside of Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters,
feedback is often negative and critical (&quot;Here's how you're fucking up&quot;),
which leads to de&shy;mo&shy;ti&shy;va&shy;tion <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/05/23/ToastmastersEvaluations.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Nick Sandman earned a Victoria Cross in the Falklands
and spent a year relearning how to walk.
Now all he wants to do is to restore <em>Sycorax</em>, his beloved old boat.
But to afford that, he has to work for TV star Tony Bannister.
Bannister wants to win the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.routehalifaxsaintpierre.com/new_site/contentframes/the_race.htm">St Pier&shy;re–Hal&shy;i&shy;fax race</a> with Sandman's help

<p>It's late 1990 and Saddam Hussein has just invaded Kuwait.
Paul Shanahan is an exiled Irish-American yacht delivery skipper.
He used to be a gunrunner for the IRA,
but rumors that he was a CIA agent have kept them at arms' length.
Now the IRA have engaged him to sail $5,000,000 in Libyan-supplied gold coins
across the Atlantic to buy 53 Stinger missiles.
It stinks but he can't say no.
And maybe he is the CIA agent that he's rumored to be.</p>

Tony Stark's hubris leads to the creation of a lethal robot with daddy issues.
Ultron, who is supposed to be the ultimate planetary line of defense,
