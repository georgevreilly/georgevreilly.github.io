    </header>
    <p>Two weeks ago, we painted the kitchen blue.
A deeper blue than I had intended.
It had more than a little bit of the Greek taverna about it.</p>
<p>Today, we started work on the &quot;bar room&quot;,
the room between the kitchen and the back yard,
where we keep the booze.
No painting yet.
We've taken everything out of that room and cleaned.
Fifteen years of cobwebs have been removed from behind the book cases.</p>
<p>Soon, a lighter blue.</p>

<p>Tom Hardy has had a very good year,
starring in <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> and
playing both Reggie and Ronnie Kray in
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_(2015_film)">Legend</a>.</p>
<p><em>Legend</em> loving recreates London in the Swinging Sixties
when the Kray twins were not only notorious gangsters but also celebri&shy;ties,
mingling with the rich and famous in their nightclubs.
Reggie is portrayed as the smarter, charming, and stable brother;
Ronnie as erratic and psy&shy;cho&shy;pathic;
both are capable of great violence.
The film is narrated from beyond the grave by Reggie's wife, Frances,
and con&shy;cen&shy;trates mostly on Reggie.
Hardy is excellent as Reggie, but hard to understand as Ronnie,
while Emily Browning does a fine job as the young wife who's <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2015/12/11/ReviewLegend.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Die Hards 1 and 2 are the best in the series.
Although they seemed wildly over the top when they were made (1988 and 1990),
they seem un&shy;der&shy;stat&shy;ed compared to the thrillers that Hollywood pumps out now.</p>
<p>We saw Die Hard again tonight.
Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman shine in their breakout roles.
Willis exhibits the trademark cockiness that was already familiar
from <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlighting_(TV_series)">Moon&shy;light&shy;ing</a>,
but he's not as obnoxious as he often was in later roles.
Rickman gently nibbles the scenery as a terrorist turned master criminal.</p>

<p>Emma's been com&shy;plain&shy;ing for some time that USB devices only worked in one port
on her Lenovo E545 laptop.
The USB 2 port worked;
the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_3.0">USB 3</a> ports didn't.</p>
<p>I took a look at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.howtogeek.com/167094/how-to-use-the-windows-device-manager-for-troubleshooting/">Device Manager</a>,
and I noticed that most of the USB nodes looked wrong.
She went to the Lenovo website and downloaded two USB-related drivers,
the AMD USB Filter Driver and the AMD USB 3.0 Driver.
Between them, they fixed the problem and she now has all ports working.</p>
<p>This machine is running Windows 7.
At some point, she wiped the machine to get rid of Lenovo crapware,
and installed a clean copy of Windows 7.

<p>Burke Devore is a middle-aged middle manager at a paper mill,
who's been laid off for some time.
There are too many others like him
and they're beating him out for the few positions in his field.
In des&shy;per&shy;a&shy;tion, he decides to eliminate the com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion
by placing a fake job ad&shy;ver&shy;tise&shy;ment for others with similar skills
and by killing them off.</p>
<p>Westlake is known for a variety of crime novels,
including the light-hearted, humorous <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/20/ReviewTheHotRock.html">Dortmunder</a> books.
There's humor here, but in a very dark vein, and social commentary too.

I let it drain throughout the day.</p>

They'll get another four or five hours tomorrow.
When we're ready to eat one, it'll get another hour of steaming to heat it up.

<p>Loosely modeled on the rise of the Han dynasty,
Ken Liu's fantasy tells us of two men who rise up to challenge the emperor.
Kuni Garu, the wily and wise one-time bandit, and
Mata Zyndu, the warrior scion of a deposed noble clan,
are friends initially but fall out.
The gods are at play in the affairs of men
and they take pleasure in causing trouble and strife.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the novel, but I disliked the pace at which Liu galloped through events.</p>
