    <p>Ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ing would make you think that acne is a problem only for teenagers.
Not true.
It's never entirely gone away for me.
I often find spots on my nose.
Less often, on my chin or forehead.
I've even had a few spots inside my ears.</p>
<p>For some reason, I woke up with three spots this morning:
on the side of my nose;
under my jawline, hidden by my beard;
and on the back of my neck, near the hairline.
Go figure.</p>

    <p>I got a new MacBook Pro on Monday:
a 13&quot; Retina with 16GB RAM and 500GB SSD,
which doubles both the RAM and the disk capacity
of its late-2013 pre&shy;de&shy;ces&shy;sor.
8GB wasn't really enough for software de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment.
By the time you run Chrome and PyCharm and Docker,
you don't have much RAM left.
And I was constantly having to run <a class="reference external" href="http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/">Grand Per&shy;spec&shy;tive</a>

<p>For the first time, I used the <a class="reference external" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204350">Migration Assistant</a> and a Thun&shy;der&shy;bolt cable

<p>The drug smugglers who bring their mer&shy;chan&shy;dise in through the Florida Keys
need some local expertise and decide that Breeze Albury is their man.
Although he has no desire to be involved,
they force him to take part.
When they need a convenient fall guy and set him up,
he turns on The Machine and on the corrupt local cops.
Revenge is sweet.</p>
<p>Although it's set in Florida,
this early Hiaasen novel lacks the humor of his more famous books.

Two years ago, we started over,
reading chapters 1 and 4 in&shy;ter&shy;leaved.
In Chapter 1 (Telemachus), Stephen Dedalus arises in the Martello Tower at Sandymount
and feuds with Buck Mulligan.
Chapter 4 (Calypso) takes place at the same time as Chapter 1,
wherein Leopold Bloom breaks his fast.</p>

<p>The Washington state Democratic Caucus was held today.
The final totals aren't in yet but Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton
by a nearly 3:1 margin around the state.
Our own precinct, SEA 11-1945, had Sanders 41, Clinton 26, Undecided 2.
That translates to 4 Sanders delegates and 2 Clinton delegates
in the next level of caucusing.</p>
<p>Emma and I both voted for Sanders.
We believe that Sanders represents much-needed change
in the party and in the nation.
Clinton is un&shy;doubt&shy;ed&shy;ly one of the most qualified candidates ever,
with an ex&shy;tra&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nary résumé and a high degree of competence.
She's also too tied to the status quo for my liking.</p>

    <p>Despite being a <em>bona fide</em> per&shy;for&shy;mance expert—I spent a couple of years as the Per&shy;for&shy;mance Lead
for Mi&shy;crosoft&shy;'s IIS web server product about 15 years ago—I still forget to measure rather than assume.</p>
<p>I wrote some code today that imported nearly 300,000 nodes into a graph
from a 500MB XML file.
The code was not par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly fast and I assumed that it was the XML parser.
I had been using the built-in streaming parser, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.iterparse">cEle&shy;ment&shy;Tree iterparse</a>.
I assumed that using the <a class="reference external" href="http://lxml.de/api/lxml.etree.iterparse-class.html">lmxl iterparse</a> would make the code faster.
It didn't.</p>
<p>Then I had the bright idea of tem&shy;porar&shy;i&shy;ly disabling the per-node processing,
which left only the XML parsing.

<p>I have a few moles on my body, mostly on my legs.
My doctor has disliked the look of some of my moles for years.
After my most recent annual physical,
I went to see a der&shy;ma&shy;tol&shy;o&shy;gist a month ago.
There was only one mole that she wanted to treat,
low on my left calf.
She took a biopsy,
using a tiny little saw to peel the top layer off
after the area had been numbed with a local anesthetic.</p>

The mole was “abnormal” but not cancerous.
