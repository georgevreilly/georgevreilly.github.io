    <p>I&#8217;m in&shy;dif&shy;fer&shy;ent to most fantasy books, but I&#8217;ve been a fan of
George <span class="caps">R.R.</span> Martin&#8217;s <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series,
since I read the first book,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553573403/georgvreill-20">A Game of Thrones</a>,
in 1997.
I read the second book
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553108034/georgvreill-20">A Clash of Kings</a>,
in 1999.
The third book
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055357342X/georgvreill-20">A Storm of Swords</a>
came out five years ago, and I&#8217;ve been awaiting
the fourth book,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553801503/georgvreill-20">A Feast for Crows</a>,
ever since.
After several post&shy;pone&shy;ments, it&#8217;s finally&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an epic tale of love, war, and intrigue.
Five Kings are fighting for control,
by sword, by guile, and sometimes by magic.
Strange creatures are rising in the frozen North, beyond the Wall.
Dragons are reap&shy;pear&shy;ing in the South.

<p>Mc&shy;Carthy&shy;ism was a raging plague in the 1950s
and the virus rampaged across Texas like tum&shy;ble&shy;weeds in a wind storm.
&#8230;
The low point, said Maverick, came when the state Senate passed a bill
to remove all books from public libraries which “ad&shy;verse&shy;ly” reflected
on American and Texas history, the family and religion.
Even the state teachers as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;a&shy;tion endorsed the bill,
in exchange for a pay raise.&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<p>That was the lay of the land in the 1950s.
And Democrats were in charge, remember?
That’s right: Texas was a one-party state;
Re&shy;pub&shy;li&shy;cans were as scarce in high office as Democrats are today.

    <p>A year ago, I ran into a problem with <a class="reference external" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/george_v_reilly/archive/2004/09/15/230281.aspx">Skype squatting on port 80</a>,
which I had long forgotten about.
Today, I ran into one with Skype squatting on port&nbsp;443.</p>
<p>I was trying to set up <span class="caps">SSL</span> on my Windows Server 2003 dev box.
My ultimate goal is to experiment with client certs and server certs for <span class="caps">SOAP</span>,
but that&#8217;s a story for another time.
I was running into all kinds of strange problems,
ex&shy;ac&shy;er&shy;bat&shy;ed by the relatively strange <span class="caps">IIS</span> con&shy;fig&shy;u&shy;ra&shy;tion on my&nbsp;machine.</p>
<p>I tried <a class="reference external" href="https://www.iis.net/downloads/community/2009/09/ssl-diagnostics-tool-for-iis-7">SslDiag</a>.
In hindsight, it pointed me towards the underlying problem,

    <p>Last Wednesday night, Emma emailed a dozen of our friends,
inviting them to join us for Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing dinner.
One reply arrived the next morning. Then&nbsp;nothing.</p>
<p>By Sunday evening, I had grown ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ed enough
to send out a snarky&nbsp;followup:</p>
<blockquote>
The courtesy of a belated reply would be ap&shy;pre&shy;ci&shy;at&shy;ed.
So far, we&#8217;ve got exactly one <span class="caps">RSVP</span>.</blockquote>
<p>It served its purpose.
Replies cascaded in. Most, alas, said &quot;no&quot;;
they had other&nbsp;plans.</p>
<p>Would that this were an isolated incident.
Time and again, I&#8217;ve issued in&shy;vi&shy;ta&shy;tions that were not responded to.
A simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; is ideal.
A &quot;maybe&quot; is acceptable too,
especially if you follow up with a &quot;yes&quot; or a&nbsp;&quot;no&quot;.</p>

    <p>I finally updated my blog to run on dasBlog 1.8.
Not too painful.
I unzipped the binary dis&shy;tri&shy;b&shy;u&shy;tion,
downloaded the content folder from my server to my local drive,
ran the provided upgrade utility,
and used WinMerge to update the con&shy;fig&shy;u&shy;ra&shy;tion&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>The most obvious change is that I&#8217;m using a new theme (skin),
which gives the site a very different look.
The previous default theme had problems if your browser window was too narrow,
due to some hardcoded table sizes (I&nbsp;think).</p>
<p>I also figured out how to post to dasBlog via w.bloggar.
I looked for info on con&shy;fig&shy;ur&shy;ing w.bloggar a few weeks ago, and couldn&#8217;t find it&nbsp;then.</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;all,</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has assisted George <span class="amp">&amp;</span> me in our attempt to
ready our home for hurricane&nbsp;evacuees.</p>
<p>Re&shy;gret&shy;tably, I have come to realize that I&#8217;m not emo&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly able to
make this commitment after all.  I thought I could open my home to
others, but I have sunk into a depression over the past few weeks that
has finally convinced me that I tried to bite off more than I could&nbsp;chew.</p>

    <p>The basement looks far better tonight than last&nbsp;night.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I removed all the lower panels along the entire front wall,
and filled in the cracks with concrete.
I also bought some in&shy;ex&shy;pen&shy;sive folding doors that will require some&nbsp;framing.</p>
<p>Today, Chuck came over after the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.binetseattle.org/meeting.html#brunch">BiNet Brunch</a>
and helped me put back up the panels
and finish all the painting.
It looks intensely yellow.
The dark blue carpet will help tone it&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>After I&#8217;ve framed the doors,
the carpet can be layed.
I&#8217;m busy all next weekend,
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mountaineers.org/photography/workshop.html">Tim Grey&#8217;s Photoshop Seminar</a>,
so I&#8217;ll have to do it in the&nbsp;evenings.</p>
<p>I have not yet been able to order the window.
