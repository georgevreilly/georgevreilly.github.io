<p>Lots of new babies around.</p>
<p>Dilip in North Carolina emailed me the other day
and mentioned the recent birth of his daughter, Anuragini.
And Alan in Dublin emailed me this morning,
to tell me of the birth of his daughter, Beth.</p>
<p>My sister, Michelle Bowles, is due to give birth on the 19th
to the first Reilly grandchild.
We arrive in Dublin on the 21st.
First babies tend to be born late,
so we may get there before the baby does.
She and David have elected not to learn the gender of the baby,
so I addressed their Christmas card to &quot;Michelle, David, and TBD&quot;.</p>

<p>We've gone high-def over the last month.
First, Emma bought a <a class="reference external" href="http://www2.panasonic.com/consumer-electronics/support/Televisions/VIERA-Plasma-HDTVs/model.TH-42PZ80U.S">42&quot; 1080p plasma Panasonic HDTV</a>
to replace the 32&quot; CRT TV in our living room.
Although it's wider, it's not over&shy;whelm&shy;ing,
as the slender box sits further back.
The picture's pretty good—at least when you give it a good signal.</p>
<p>To take advantage of it required a cascade of upgrades.
Our old TiVo served us well for eight years;
ap&shy;point&shy;ment TV has long been alien to us.
It's dis&shy;con&shy;nect&shy;ed now, replaced the other day
by a DirecTV Plus DVR and a new satellite dish.
I had heard bad things about the older DirecTV DVRs,
but I have no complaints about this <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/10/HDTV.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I look out the window.
Driz&shy;zling—not too heavy—I'll ride to work.
Pack my clothes into the panier bag.
Spandex tights, coat, yellow jacket, helmet, gloves: on they go.
Bike's in the garage, seems okay, slap on the bag.
Pull it out, reset the odometer.
17 minutes today?</p>
<p>Ignite the blinky lights, pull away.
Down the side roads, until I'm compelled to take the arterial.
Press the crosswalk button, wait for a break in the traffic.
Two minutes, three, does this fucking light <em>ever</em> change?
Off like a shot, past Jefferson Park.
Maybe they'll finish by next summer.
Hit the next light at 2:30.
A long, gentle uphill for the next 8 minutes.

<p>There's little that I miss about Irish cooking.
One notable exception is Brown Bread aka Brown Soda Bread.
I don't know of any bakery that makes it in the States,
though I've found it at a couple of Irish pubs.
The main difficulty in making it is
finding the coarse-ground wholemeal flour.
The usual fine-ground stuff has the wrong texture.</p>
<p>I know of only one place in the Seattle area that carries
the right flour and that's
The Grainery, 13629 1st Ave S, Burien, WA 98168; (206) 244-5015.
I bought some flour there today,
made a loaf, and brought the loaf and a 10lb bag of flour
to an Irish friend's birthday <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/11/30/IrishBrownBread.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>For decades, Detroit has fought a rearguard action against
change—seat&shy;belts, CAFE standards for increased fuel efficiency,
met&shy;ri&shy;ca&shy;tion, renewable energy, building gas guzzling SUVs
instead of hybrids, all come to mind.</p>
<p>Change is needed.
The current management must go.
The big three must build vehicles that make sense.</p>

but his op-ed piece, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html">Let Detroit Go Bankrupt</a>,
in Wednes&shy;day's NYT lands in the vicinity of the mark.</p>
<p>He ignores one big reason for the higher costs of American cars,
the cost of company-funded healthcare.</p>
<p>But another article in the same day's paper,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/business/economy/19bankruptcy.html">Advantage of Corporate Bankruptcy Is Dwindling</a>,

<p>My formerly trusty Casio Exilim EX-Z1000 camera went berserk one night in September.
The zoom lens wedged open and nothing I did would persuade it to retract
into the case or take more photos.
The zoom had grown a little tem&shy;per&shy;me&shy;n&shy;tal in the preceding month,
but I didn't expect cat&shy;a&shy;stroph&shy;ic failure.</p>
<p>The other hardware failure was far more upsetting.</p>
<p>From Christmas until August, I ripped most of our CD collection
with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/">Exact Audio Copy</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Lossless_Audio_Codec">FLAC</a> (Free Lossless Audio Codec).
Since FLAC is lossless and open source,
I figured I'd never need to rip the CDs again.
I also wrote a Python script to convert the FLACs to MP3s with <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/11/18/HardwareLazarus.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I'm delighted!
Today, the American people made an excellent decision
and chose the right man for the job.</p>
<p>Obama fought a long, hard campaign,
rising from underdog to an assured victory.
He ran an exemplary, innovative campaign,
that empowered millions of grassroots activists.
He shattered barriers and inspired voters.</p>
<p>He won by a huge margin in the Electoral College,
giving himself un&shy;equiv&shy;o&shy;cal legitimacy.
He'll need it.
The country has deep problems and it's not going to be an easy presidency.</p>

<p>I'm voting for Obama, which is no secret to anyone who knows me.
I agree with his policies and I'm impressed by the man.
Over the last two years, he's run an excellent campaign,
going from underdog to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2008/10/25/obamas_lead/">all-but certain victory</a>.
Clearly, he has executive ability.</p>
<p>Moreover, McCain is the wrong man for the job.
I strongly disagree with his policies (es&shy;sen&shy;tial&shy;ly Bush's),
his campaign is thrashing spas&shy;ti&shy;cal&shy;ly,
and he dis&shy;qual&shy;i&shy;fied himself by picking that blithering idiot Palin as his VP.</p>
<p>I'm more worried about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chrisgregoire.com/">Christine Gregoire</a>,
who is running for re-election as Governor of Washington.
She's un&shy;com&shy;fort&shy;ably close in the polls to Dino Rossi.

The book in&shy;ter&shy;weaves two novels, <em>Bonanza</em> and <em>The Juncto</em>,
taking place between 1689 and 1702.
<em>Bonanza</em> follows Jack Shaftoe,
as he and other galley slaves in Algiers
capture Spanish gold of particular sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cance to some highly placed alchemists,
and make their way ever eastward,
through Cairo, India, Manila, and Mexico.
<em>The Juncto</em> deals primarily with Eliza,
now a French duchess,
and her remarkable financial derring-do.</p>
