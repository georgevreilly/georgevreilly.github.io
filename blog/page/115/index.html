<p>As I mentioned in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2003/05/16/Naturalization.aspx">my Toast&shy;mas&shy;ter&shy;s' speech about nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;iza&shy;tion</a>, I decided
on September 11th, 2002 to become a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>This morning, I had my interview with the Bureau of Cit&shy;i&shy;zen&shy;ship and
Im&shy;mi&shy;gra&shy;tion Services (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bcis.gov/">BCIS</a>, formerly known as the INS).</p>
<p>This afternoon, I was sworn in as a U.S. citizen at the Seattle INS Office.
Eighty-three other new citizens were sworn in at the same time. Many were
Filipino, Vietnamese, Mexican, or Eastern European. Only three others, all
Brits, were from Western Europe. We were gathered into a stuffy room with
an overflow crowd of relatives and friends. <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/07/25/USCitizen.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I gave the following speech to Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters on June 25th, 2003, as Speech
#4, &quot;Show What You Mean&quot;. Clearly, I've reused some material from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2003/06/11/Bloomsday.aspx">my earlier post about Bloomsday</a>.
I'm also finding that I take longer to
deliver a speech to an audience than I do when rehearsing, so I cut some of
the material on the day to fit the seven-minute limit.</p>
<p>I've uploaded <a class="reference external" href="http://www.george-reilly.com/photos/Bloomsday-2003/">some photos of the reading</a>
to one of my other websites.</p>

<p>I detest George W. Bush and his ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion. The war, the economy, the
en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment, the judicial battles. I loathe just about everything that
comes out of the White House. I want that man <em>gone</em>.</p>
<p>I've been following the Democratic pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial candidates with some
interest for the last few months. Right now, I feel like I'm a yellow dog
Democrat. I don't care who wins in 2004, just so long as it's a Democrat.</p>
<p>That's not really true, however. I'd much rather have a candidate that I
have some enthusiasm for, rather than the lesser of two evils: <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/06/12/HowardDeanForPresident.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I have recently become involved with the upcoming local cel&shy;e&shy;bra&shy;tion of
Bloomsday, on June 16th. James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em> takes place on June 16th,
1904. In Seattle and elsewhere, fans of the book re-enact portions of the
book. In Dublin, Joyce has spawned a whole industry: ironic, when you
consider how little recog&shy;ni&shy;tion he received there during his lifetime. No
doubt, the Joycean industry will go into overdrive next year for the
centenary.</p>
<p>The Seattle group has been working its way through the book since 1998.
This year, we are reading Chapters 8 and 9, &quot;Lestry&shy;go&shy;ni&shy;ans&quot; and &quot;Scylla and
Charybdis&quot;. <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/06/11/Bloomsday.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>NAT&shy;U&shy;RAL&shy;IZA&shy;TION</p>
<p>Fellow Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters and Guests, last September, on the first
an&shy;niver&shy;sary of 9/11, I made one of the biggest decisions of my life: I
decided to apply for American cit&shy;i&shy;zen&shy;ship, to become nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;ized.</p>
<p>Like many of you, I am an immigrant. I have spent most of my adult life
in this country. Fourteen years ago, I came to the US from Ireland to
earn a Masters degree. I moved to Seattle in 1992, the same year that I
became a permanent resident. I <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/05/16/Naturalization.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>SLEEP APNEA</p>
<p>My wife is a cyborg.</p>
<p>That's not to say that she's the Terminator. Nor even that she's the
six-million dollar woman, although I do value her greatly. She calls
herself a cyborg because she sleeps with a breathing machine. At night,
she wears a mask over her nose to force air into her lungs.</p>

not getting a good night's sleep, of feeling stupid. When she drove <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/04/24/SleepApnea.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>I've been too busy in the last few weeks to post anything here. Mostly
because I've been busy with work. Partially because I'm too disgusted with
Iraq to say anything useful: Win the war and lose the peace. Feh!</p>
<p>In the last few days, I've been at home taking care of Emma. On Friday
morning, she had a Morton's neuroma removed from her left foot. A nerve
running through the space between a couple of her toes had become enlarged
to about a centimeter in diameter, and it had been causing her a lot of
pain. She <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/04/22/HerLeftFoot.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
