<p>When using Lightroom before, I was never able to figure out how
to move photos from one folder to another.
You'd think that you could just click on a photo and drag it.
I just spent twenty minutes figuring out what I've been doing wrong.
After you've selected multiple photos,
click on the <em>photo thumbnail</em> and <em>not</em> the sur&shy;round&shy;ing gray frame,
and then you can drag the photos to the target folder.</p>
<p>I had become accustomed to clicking on the frames to multi-select photos,
so naturally I assumed that was also how you dragged a set of photos.
But clicking on a frame of a selected photo merely deselects <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/08/16/MovingPhotosInLightroom.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>The unnamed nar&shy;ra&shy;tor—My name? If I told you that you'd be as clever as me—is an up-and-coming London drug dealer who wants to retire by his thirtieth birthday.
He's pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al, low-key, and a little bit cocky, and he has every chance of pulling it off.
He re&shy;luc&shy;tant&shy;ly does a favor for the crime boss Jimmy Price and
suddenly his plans are derailed.
Double-crosses, snitches, betrayals, murders, hold ups, and stings ensue.
There's little honor among thieves, save for our hero's immediate circle.</p>

<p>After reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/08/15/ReviewLayerCakeBook.aspx">Layer Cake</a> earlier this week, I decided to rewatch the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_Cake_(film)">movie</a>.
The screenplay was written by J.J. Connolly, adapting his own novel.
Although the convoluted plot has been much simplified and somewhat rearranged,
it's still complex and tricky to follow.
Most of the humor is gone, as director Matthew Vaughn didn't want to make <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock,_Stock_and_Two_Smoking_Barrels">Lock Stock</a> III.
It's more of a straight thriller.
The Cockney is toned down, making it easier for a non-UK audience.
And Daniel Craig is somewhat older and calmer than the narrator of the book.</p>
<p>The film succeeds both in its own right and as <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/08/15/ReviewLayerCakeMovie.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I rode Seattle's new Light Rail system for the first time yesterday morning.
I walked to the new Beacon Hill station.
It took me just over 20&nbsp;minutes at a brisk pace,
so I'm not likely to walk there often.
I could have taken the 60&nbsp;bus to the station,
but it only runs every 30&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<p>When I got to the Beacon Hill station,
I couldn't figure out if my book of $2.00&nbsp;tickets
for Metro bus tickets were valid on the train or not.
The first three workers I asked didn't know either.
The cop I asked said “yes”, so I took the elevator 167&nbsp;feet down to the platform
and rode the train <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/08/14/LightRail.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Tonight was the annual Irish Night at the Mariners
and we bought tickets for $11.</p>
<p>Even after 20 years in the States,
I still know next to nothing about baseball.
I picked up a copy of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.baseballfieldguide.com/">Baseball Field Guide</a>
before last year's Irish Night,
and found the first chapter very helpful in explaining the basics.
I re-read it last night and it helped me follow tonight's game.</p>
<p>Neither the Mariners nor the White Sox could score a run.
Inning after inning the game went on, zero-zero.
No one had scored by the bottom of the ninth, so play continued.
A tenth inning.
An eleventh.

<p>For four thousand years, the gods have dwelt in human form
amongst the people of Myrillia, rooted to the very land.
When the goddess Meeryn is found murdered and the disgraced Shad&shy;owknight
Tylar de Noche is found at her side, mirac&shy;u&shy;lous&shy;ly healed of his maiming,
he is accused of being the godslayer.
He escapes and uncovers a dark conspiracy of corruption and evil.</p>
<p>As an exercise in world building, this book succeeds.
For example, the gods' <em>humors</em>—blood, seed, menses, sweat, tears, saliva, phlegm,

<p>A century and a half ago, the believers in the Black Road were forced into exile.
Now, in some bloody surprise attacks, they've conquered the Glas Valley.
The story is largely told from the viewpoints of three brother-sister pairs:
the young leaders of the Black Road attackers;
the adolescent nephew and niece of the thane of the Lannis-Haig Blood;
and a warrior of the Kyrinin race and his sister.
Each side believes that it is in the right:
the clash between two human cultures was inevitable,
as is the war between the Kyrinin tribes.</p>

<p>Ararat is vast, unknowable, unmappable,
home to many living gods who make their presence felt.
Arjun comes from his far-distant home, seeking the Voice,
the god that abandoned his people.
He arrives as the Bird sweeps through the great city,

only to be captured in the warship <em>Thunderer</em>.
A boy, Jack, also captures part of the Bird's power
as he flees the workhouse.</p>
