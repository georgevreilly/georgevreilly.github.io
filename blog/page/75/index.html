<p>I made my <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/01/05/ChristmasCake.html">Christmas Cake</a> back in November,
but am only now getting around to putting on the icing.
I’ve kept it moist with several ap­pli­ca­tions of whiskey.</p>
<p>Last year, I made <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzipan">marzipan</a> from scratch.
Never again!
It was a huge amount of work to blanch the almonds
and the stiff mixture of sugar and almonds caused the
food processor to seize up more than once.</p>
<p>I didn’t use up all the marzipan that I made that time.
I put the remainder into a sealed container,
placed it in the fridge, and forgot all about it.
When I took it out of the fridge yesterday,
it was still good.
Oh, the top half-inch had hardened

<p>Eight years ago, the Onion published a supposed speech
by then President-elect George Bush, called
‘Our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784">Long National Nightmare</a> Of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over’.
How prophetic!</p>
<p>Finally, the long national nightmare of the George W. Bush presidency is over.</p>
<p>Barack Obama took the oath of office today.
His <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/us/politics/20text-obama.html?pagewanted=all">inaugural speech</a> was somber, reasoned, cautionary, and
in­spi­ra­tional—of a piece with the man.</p>
<p>He faces enormous dif­fi­cul­ties.
There are enormous op­por­tu­ni­ties too, if he can but seize them.
The polls say that the American people do not expect overnight miracles.
I hope we will all remember that a year from now.</p>
<p>Here’s to Obama and his presidency.</p>

    <p>Twenty years ago tomorrow, I attended <a class="reference external" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DA1538F932A15752C0A96F948260">Bush Senior’s In­au­gu­ra­tion</a>.
By accident.</p>
<p>I was on my first solo trip to the United States,
having arrived in New York the previous week.
There I had purchased a 30-day unlimited standby ticket with Delta.
It cost me only $400, as I could produce my round-the-world ticket.</p>
<p>For no par­tic­u­lar­ly good reason, I decided to start
the 30 days with a trip to Washington <span class="caps">DC</span>.
There were museums there and it was nearby.</p>
<p>I hadn’t been paying close attention to the news, and
it was only when I got to Washington that I realized that
George <span class="caps">H.W.</span> Bush’s in­au­gu­ra­tion was to be be held the next day.

<p>Milk was a middle-aged closet case who moved to San Francisco in the early 1970s,
became po­lit­i­cal­ly active, and started running for office,
un­suc­cess­ful­ly at first.
“The Mayor of Castro Street” was elected to the San Francisco Board of
Su­per­vi­sors in 1977,
the first openly gay man to hold public office in the United States.
A year later, only days after the anti-gay Cal­i­forn­ian ballot initiative,
Propo­si­tion 6, went down to defeat,
Milk and Mayor George Moscone were murdered by ex-Supervisor Dan White.</p>

Metro is proposing to close the one really useful route,
the #39 which takes me to work in Pioneer Square.
The #60 gets me to 12th and S. Jackson,
nearly a mile from work.
The #36 only runs down 15th in the evenings;
otherwise it runs through Jefferson Park, half a mile away.</p>

<p>Last Sunday President-elect Barack Obama was asked whether he would seek an

believe that anybody is above the law,” he responded, but “we need to look
forward as opposed to looking backwards.”</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but if we don’t have an inquest into what happened during the
Bush years — and nearly everyone has taken Mr. Obama’s remarks to mean that
we won’t — this means that those who hold power are indeed above the law
because they don’t face any con­se­quences if they abuse their power.</p>

<p>I’ve always been a fast reader, faster than most people.
I’ve read and reviewed 176 books in just over two years,
or about two books a week.
That doesn’t count newspapers, magazines, blogs, and other online reading.</p>
<p>When I was 10, I had an operation on both my feet
and I spent all summer with my legs in plaster.
My mother had to go to the library every day
because they’d only let her take out three books at a time for me.
On the flight back from Ireland two weeks ago,
I read <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/04/ReviewAbsentFriends.html">two</a> 500-page <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/03/ReviewTheSunriseLands.html">books</a>.

<p>I seldom get bad colds, but I caught one on the plane back from Ireland,
and it’s left me drained of energy for the last ten days.
Jet lag and Frank’s death surely con­tributed too. Feh!</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll be up to cycling into work tomorrow.
Between the snow, being in Ireland for two weeks, and this cold,
it’s been almost a month since I last rode in.</p>
