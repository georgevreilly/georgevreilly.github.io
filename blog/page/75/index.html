    <p>Last weekend, we made good progress on the basement.
On Saturday, Dale and Ernest helped us out, doing some demolition
in the basement, and bringing loads to Goodwill and to the dump
in their truck.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Jill and Delf helped us clean the remaining stuff
out of the basement. Louise excavated a hole outside the window
that we're going to enlarge. Deb, currently <em>hors de combat</em>
with a pinched nerve, dropped by to provide moral support,
as did Frank and Lyndol. Delf spent nearly twelve hours with us that day,
and thanks to his experience in con&shy;struc&shy;tion, he and I built
framing around the furnace.</p>

Roy and his other family members in the Seattle area

    <p>I learned a really clever trick at our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2005/09/14/KatrinaEvacueesWorkPartiesAndScalingBack.aspx">workparty</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p>We were using a dolly that we had borrowed from our neighbor Mary
to haul a heavy credenza up from the basement.
One of the tires was flat, which made the exercise even more difficult.</p>
<p>I got out my bicycle floor pump and started pumping,
but it was a waste of time.
The tire was tubeless and without any air,
so it just slipped loosely around the rim.
After a few minutes of futility,
Dale remembered something he had seen years before at a gas station.</p>
<p>He got a bowl of soapy water and a sponge,
and coated the metal <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/14/SoapingUpAFlatTire.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>My good friend Frank Maloney turned 60 the other day.
A few months ago, he invited Emma and me to join him
and his partner, Lyndol,
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theherbfarm.com">The Herbfarm</a>.
The Herbfarm is one of the very best restau&shy;rants in the Seattle area.
Certainly one of the most expensive.</p>

<p>Frank brought us to The Herbfarm, but not at his own expense.
One of Frank's college roommates was Ron Zimmerman,
the owner of The Herbfarm,
and Ron had invited Frank to bring Lyndol and two guests
over for his 60th birthday.
Ron semi-seriously credits Frank with in&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;ing him to good wine,
when Frank was a sommelier in the Seventies.</p>

<p>We had a marvelous time.

Tens of thousands died.</p>

He played guitar in Arizona while New Orleans drowned.
Uncounted thousands died.</p>
<p>Not until Wednesday did he return to Washington.
Even now, he has yet to show leadership.
Photo ops are not leadership. Platitudes are not leadership.</p>

College. Today, we started on per&shy;spec&shy;tive. We began by watching a
45-minute <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cloudband.com/frames.mhtml/magazine/articles/rev_dinwiddie_surface_0699.html">video by David Hockney</a>, where he contrasts three paintings:
a Canaletto painting of Venice, and two Chinese scrolls painted
70 years apart.</p>
<p>The Canaletto is a classic <a class="reference external" href="http://drawsketch.about.com/library/weekly/aa021603c.htm">two-point linear per&shy;spec&shy;tive</a> painting.
Both of the Chinese scrolls show trips by the emperor along the
Grand Canal. The first one, by Wang Hui, is 27 inches high and 72 feet wide!
It uses multiple per&shy;spec&shy;tive to show scenes, in a manner
that is strange to my Western eyes. Hockney demon&shy;strates how
effective it is. For example, he shows a corner <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/07/20/SurfaceIsIllusionButSoIsDepth.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>I've been a fan of both Bernard Cornwell and Patrick O'Brian
for a number of years.
Both are known for their historic fiction set in the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
<p>Cornwell has written 20 <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bernardcornwell.net/index2.cfm?page=1&amp;SeriesId=1">books about Richard Sharpe</a>,
a rough and ready British Army officer, up from the ranks.
Cornwell excels at writing battle scenes, capturing the
smells and sounds, the noise and confusion, the blood and the gore.
Some of them were turned into a TV miniseries in the mid-1990s,
with Sean Bean as Sharpe.</p>
<p>O'Brian wrote 20 novels about Captain Jack Aubrey and
Dr. Stephen Maturin of the Royal Navy.
The Russell Crowe movie

<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/">The Wild Geese Players of Seattle</a>,
an amateur group that does readings of Irish literature,
par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly the works of James Joyce and W.B.&nbsp;Yeats.
Our big event every year is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday">Bloomsday</a>,
June 16th, com&shy;mem&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ing Joyce's Ulysses,

It's a tale of a Jewish everyman, Leopold Bloom,
wandering through Dublin one day,
and of the young writer (and Joyce's alter ego), Stephen Dedalus.
We're working our way through the book,
reading a chapter or two each year.
In this, our eighth year, we'll be reading Chapter&nbsp;11, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2005.html">Sirens</a>,
