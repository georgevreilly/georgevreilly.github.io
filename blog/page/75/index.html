<p>Since the summer, I&#8217;ve been working on and off on a mobile site for Cozi.
Chris, one of our interns, did a lot of the initial work.
Getting it to a deployable state has
been my primary focus over the last few&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to say that as of today <a class="reference external" href="http://m.cozi.com/">m.cozi.com</a> is in public beta.
Will wrote a little about it at the <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.cozi.com/coziblog/2008/12/cozi-mobile.html">Cozi Blog</a>;
take a look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cozi.com/Promo-Cozi-Mobile.htm">promo</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, the mobile site supports shopping lists and the calendar.
In the calendar, you can view, create, and edit your ap&shy;point&shy;ments.
On the shopping page, you can update your shopping lists

<p>We&#8217;ve gone high-def over the last month.
First, Emma bought a <a class="reference external" href="http://www2.panasonic.com/consumer-electronics/support/Televisions/VIERA-Plasma-HDTVs/model.TH-42PZ80U.S">42&quot; 1080p plasma Panasonic <span class="caps">HDTV</span></a>
to replace the 32&quot; <span class="caps">CRT</span> <span class="caps">TV</span> in our living room.
Although it&#8217;s wider, it&#8217;s not over&shy;whelm&shy;ing,
as the slender box sits further back.
The picture&#8217;s pretty good—at least when you give it a good&nbsp;signal.</p>
<p>To take advantage of it required a cascade of upgrades.
Our old TiVo served us well for eight years;
ap&shy;point&shy;ment <span class="caps">TV</span> has long been alien to us.
It&#8217;s dis&shy;con&shy;nect&shy;ed now, replaced the other day
by a DirecTV Plus <span class="caps">DVR</span> and a new satellite dish.
I had heard bad things about the older DirecTV DVRs,
but I have no complaints about this one&nbsp;yet.</p>

<p>Eric had the temerity last week to <a class="reference external" href="http://offby1-whining.blogspot.com/2008/12/pentaho.html">gripe</a> on his blog
about a certain open source business in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gence product,

Apparently he showed up in their Google Alerts.
Some of the posters were helpful,
but the <em>ad hominem</em> attackers were more&nbsp;en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing:</p>
<blockquote>
Your blog has had 22 posts in the past year, and your blogroll includes
absolutely no one of note in the open source world. So I think it’s

I said that it was the first in a series of daily posts for <a class="reference external" href="http://nablopomo.ning.com/">NaBloPoMo</a>,
the National Blog Posting Month, which I had just found out&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>Here I am a month later, having posted something every single evening.
I covered humor; movie and book reviews; being the #1 tech blog (now #2);
politics; Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing; food; personal stuff; and even some technical posts.&nbsp;Whew!</p>
<p>Why bother? As with the two-year-old exercise in book reviews,
it was a personal challenge to come up with a post every single evening

<p>We saw a production of David Sedaris&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattlepublictheater.org/events-santaland.htm">Santaland Diaries</a>
at the Bathhouse Theater tonight. Funny&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we walked over to the Greenlake Bluwater Restaurant
to get a spot of dinner.
We both ordered Tuscan White Bean soup for a starter,
Emma had the Turkey Pot Pie,
and mine was the&nbsp;Fettucine.</p>
<p>The soup was fine and my fettucine was okay.
Emma&#8217;s pot pie had problems.
The potatoes were raw and it had a funny lemony aftertaste.
She pushed the plate away and waited for the waitress to come by.
The waitress apologized and brought Emma the menu.
Emma opted for the meatloaf, since that would come quickly.
The manager apologized and offered us a <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/07/CantTakeHerAnywhere.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>This book wobbles between not very black comedy

<p>I don&#8217;t, as a rule, pay a great deal of attention to Canadian politics.
I was vaguely aware that something unusual is going on there this week.
Then Emma pointed me to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yarnharlot.ca/blog/archives/2008/12/03/what_is_happening_in_canada.html">Yarn Harlot</a>&#8216;s ex&shy;pla&shy;na&shy;tion
of what&#8217;s&nbsp;happened.</p>
<p>In brief, for the last two years,
Stephen Harper&#8217;s minority government has been playing
a high-stakes game, repeatedly forcing the opposition parties
to either vote with him or force an election, which they
would likely&nbsp;lose.</p>
<p>Last week, as soon as Parliament resumed after October&#8217;s general election,
Harper put forth an &quot;economic strategy&quot;, which included removing
federal election subsidies to all par&shy;ties—&shy;ef&shy;fec&shy;tive&shy;ly hobbling the opposition.
The opposition were deeply unhappy about that,

they bought with huge sums of borrowed money, and imagine what they’d

<p>Emma worked at WaMu as a software tester for three years.
I&#8217;m sure that if she were still there, she&#8217;d be one of them.

<p>A few years ago, WaMu seemed too big to fail.
Now? Circling the toilet&nbsp;bowl.</p>
<p>Our whole economy seems like it was one giant Ponzi scheme,

Driz&shy;zling—not too heavy—I&#8217;ll ride to work.
Pack my clothes into the panier bag.
Spandex tights, coat, yellow jacket, helmet, gloves: on they go.
Bike&#8217;s in the garage, seems okay, slap on the bag.
Pull it out, reset the odometer.
17 minutes&nbsp;today?</p>
<p>Ignite the blinky lights, pull away.
Down the side roads, until I&#8217;m compelled to take the arterial.
Press the crosswalk button, wait for a break in the traffic.
Two minutes, three, does this fucking light <em>ever</em> change?
Off like a shot, past Jefferson Park.
Maybe they&#8217;ll finish by next summer.
Hit the next light at 2:30.
A long, gentle uphill for the next 8 minutes.
