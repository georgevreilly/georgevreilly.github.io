<p>I tried to take the bus into work today, but no bus showed.
I later learned that the #39 had been “tem&shy;porar&shy;i&shy;ly suspended”.
Emma drove into downtown Seattle, getting off at the James St. exit.
James is steep and it was closed to traffic.
She let me out at 7th and James and
I walked down to the Smith&nbsp;Tower.</p>
<p>Other people were <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/392969_bus20.html">not so lucky</a> on the steeper streets,
as you can see in the photo of a bus hanging over the&nbsp;interstate.</p>
<p>This is the worst snow we&#8217;ve had in several years,
and Seattle is not equipped to handle it.

<p>When we went to bed on Wednesday night, most of the weekend&#8217;s snow had melted.
We were woken around 5:30am by two large <a class="reference external" href="http://beaconhill.seattle.wa.us/2008/12/18/did-you-hear-that/">thunder claps</a>,
attributed to <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/392821_storm19.html">thun&shy;der&shy;snow</a>.
The snow was falling again and fell for most of the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>We were sensible and stayed home.
So, it seems, did almost everyone else at Cozi.
I worked remotely for part of the day.
Otherwise, we watched movies.
I felt no desire to go outside and make snowmen,
though we certainly could&nbsp;have.</p>
<p>We fly to Ireland on Saturday morning.
I&#8217;m a little worried about getting to the&nbsp;airport.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m Irish. I was raised on butter.
Not margarine. Butter.
Good Irish butter.
Yellow, creamy, with a little&nbsp;salt.</p>
<p>Melted onto toast.
A soft yellow layer on bread.
A pat of butter on your potatoes.
Fry your eggs in butter.
Let butter melt on your&nbsp;chips.</p>
<p>I knew butter was important in baking,
but I didn&#8217;t realize until <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/dining/17bake.html">today</a> how carefully it should be&nbsp;treated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common mistakes made by home bakers, pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;als say,
have to do with the care and handling of one ingredient: butter.
Creaming butter correctly, keeping butter doughs cold,
and starting with fresh, good-tasting butter
are vital details that pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;als take for granted,
and home bakers often&nbsp;miss.</p>
<p>Butter is basically an emulsion of water in <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/18/Butter.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>My friends Frank and Lyndol met 32 years ago today,
the day they celebrate as their an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
For several years, Emma and I have brought them out for dinner on this date.
We also celebrate Lyn&#8217;s birthday,
which falls next&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>Frank&#8217;s health has been poor for some years,
but it&#8217;s grown worse this year.
He spent six weeks in hospital in September and October.
He&#8217;s home now, but he&#8217;s in <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.motss/browse_thread/thread/38e9223106252317">hospice care</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, we try to see him often,
since he rarely feels strong enough to leave the house,
even in a wheelchair.
We almost always find him in good form,
glad to see us and ready with his&nbsp;stories.</p>

who doesn&#8217;t fit in well in swinging London.
His brother is murdered and he finds himself embroiled
in the search for a lost Mayan city in the Yucutan peninsula.
His companions are a rich old ar&shy;chae&shy;ol&shy;o&shy;gist,
a paranoid young ar&shy;chae&shy;ol&shy;o&shy;gist, and his attractive wife.
Somewhere out in the jungle is a Mafia don

<p>It snowed in Seattle yesterday.
We drove over to Sammamish last night to my <span class="caps">CEO</span>&#8217;s house
for the Holiday Party.
The snow wasn&#8217;t sticking to the roads,
so although visibility wasn&#8217;t great,
getting there and back was not&nbsp;difficult.</p>
<p>It was cold today and colder tonight.
I saw only a light dusting of snow fall today,
but the snow that was melting earlier has&nbsp;refrozen.</p>
<p>We had to go out this evening,
over to Burien to see Frank.
The main roads were fine,
but we had a slightly alarming descent
on a hill near us as we headed over there.
Coming home, we had a couple of unpleasant minutes
trying to get up a hill near Frank&#8217;s.

<p>Lots of new babies&nbsp;around.</p>
<p>Dilip in North Carolina emailed me the other day
and mentioned the recent birth of his daughter, Anuragini.
And Alan in Dublin emailed me this morning,
to tell me of the birth of his daughter,&nbsp;Beth.</p>
<p>My sister, Michelle Bowles, is due to give birth on the 19th
to the first Reilly grandchild.
We arrive in Dublin on the 21st.
First babies tend to be born late,
so we may get there before the baby does.
She and David have elected not to learn the gender of the baby,
so I addressed their Christmas card to &quot;Michelle, David, and&nbsp;<span class="caps">TBD</span>&quot;.</p>

<p>Emma had a chance to play with Jacob&#8217;s Kindle (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA">Amazon</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle">Wikipedia</a>) today,
while I looked&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>The electronic paper screen is one of the big selling points.
We found the text to be very readable, albeit black-and-white.
It works very well for its primary use case—dis&shy;play&shy;ing
book pages with minimal battery drain—but it&#8217;s sluggish when updating&nbsp;menus.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not impressed by the design of the case.
The buttons on the side are far too big;
the keyboard at the bottom is ridiculous.
It would be in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing to see what Apple could&nbsp;do.</p>

Chris, one of our interns, did a lot of the initial work.
Getting it to a deployable state has

<p>Currently, the mobile site supports shopping lists and the calendar.
