<p>Emma bought herself a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tivo.com/1.0.asp">TiVo Digital Video Recorder</a>
a few weeks ago. I had heard it said
that TiVo changes the way you watch TV. It's true. Emma is fond of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hgtv.com/">Home and Garden Television (HGTV)</a>,
which has a lot of shows about re&shy;dec&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ing and re&shy;mod&shy;el&shy;ling. They're padded
un&shy;mer&shy;ci&shy;ful&shy;ly, constantly recapping what they showed you before the most
recent break. She can work through an ostensible 30-minute show in under 10
minutes by skipping from highlight to highlight.</p>
<p>Our TiVo also has a DirecTV satellite receiver built in, giving us access
to far more stations than we had on <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/02/10/TiVo.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I have received hundreds of copies of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.potifos.com/fraud/">Nigerian scam spam</a> in the last couple of years. Nigerian
criminals, typically claiming to be relatives of rich-but-deceased African
potentates, ask for &quot;help&quot; in getting assets out of Africa. You are asked
to pony up some money to defray expenses, in return for a cut of the
proceeds.</p>
<p>Someone has put together a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.politechbot.com/p-04372.html">Bush-Iraq parody</a> of these letters. George Walker
Bush, son of the former President of the USA, seeks your help in acquiring
oil funds that are trapped in Iraq...</p>

<p>Tomorrow [Wed Feb 5th, 2003], Colin Powell goes to the UN to make his case
against Iraq. Reportedly, he has &quot;no smoking gun&quot;.</p>
<p>To my mind, the Bush Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion has not yet made a compelling case for
going to war.</p>
<p>Yes, Saddam Hussein is a murderous tyrant. Yes, he has not come clean with
the UN and appears to be in &quot;material breach&quot; of Resolution 1441. Yes, he
almost certainly has chemical and biological weapons, though probably not
nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>But, to my mind, this is not a case for war. Con&shy;tain&shy;ment has worked for the
last twelve years. <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/02/08/CasusBelli.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

I was very careful never to call myself &quot;gay&quot; because that label never fit

can explain their surprise when I told them a few years later that I had
fallen in love with Emma and was going to marry her.</p>

<p>I didn't listen to Bush's State of the Union last week, because I was still
at work. Reading about it afterwards, I found it to be pre&shy;dictably
ob&shy;jec&shy;tion&shy;able.</p>
<p>I'm a Toast&shy;mas&shy;ter, so I found Salon's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/01/30/sotu_critique/index_np.html">&quot;Horrible&quot; speaker, great speech</a>
to be an in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing critique of the delivery and pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion.</p>
<p>The only parts of the speech that I did care for were the hydrogen car and
the promise to help prevent and treat AIDS in Africa.</p>
<p>Hydrogen cars would be a big im&shy;prove&shy;ment over gas-guzzling SUVs, but there
are a few problems. First, they're many years out and the <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/02/08/StateOfTheUnion.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
