<p>Today, I did something that I&#8217;ve never done before.
I visited my <span class="caps">US</span> Senators&#8217; offices, with a handful of others,
to help stiffen their spines on healthcare&nbsp;reform.</p>
<p>It started by accident last night when Mira mentioned on Facebook
that she was going to visit Rep. Jim McDermott, Sen. Maria Cantwell,
and Sen. Patty Murray&#8217;s Seattle offices today
to talk to them about the “public&nbsp;option”.</p>
<p>McDermott and Murray were already supporters of the public health insurance option.
Cantwell&#8217;s position was murkier and she came out in favor of
some kind of lame “co-op” compromise earlier this week.
Mira and her friends had no difficulty in setting up meetings with McDermott and <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/06/27/TalkingToSenatorsAboutHealthcareReform.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

Google Maps crashed Safari&nbsp;4 while trying to print the&nbsp;map.</p>

Joanne Kilbourn and her family become entangled

when he is murdered.
His advisor, Joanne Kilbourn, sees him drink the poison.
Her own husband was sense&shy;less&shy;ly murdered a few years earlier,

When she decides to write a biography of Andy
and learns unexpected things about him,
her health mys&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;ous&shy;ly begins to&nbsp;fail.</p>

I blamed Windows Update, since it happened within hours of a pile of updates being installed.
I upgraded to the latest beta NVidia drivers on Monday
and it helped for a while, but by Wednesday,
it was almost as bad again as it had been last Friday.
It was in&shy;fu&shy;ri&shy;at&shy;ing and I was both en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing and alarming my neighbors
with my&nbsp;cursing.</p>

<p>I walked past this truck at Second and Pike on Monday and did a double-take.
Eric was intrigued too when I showed him a photo later,
and we went back to in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gate&nbsp;yesterday.</p>
<p>They only opened a few weeks ago.
As yet, the menu is limited.
The Maximus is a pulled pork sandwich with a hot sauce,
while the Minimus has a tangy sauce.
They have a vegetarian sandwich, chips made from potatoes and vegetables,
and hibiscus and ginger&nbsp;lemonades.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t much care for barbecue as a rule.
The Minimus with a sprinkling of Beecher&#8217;s cheese was good, but not out&shy;stand&shy;ing.
The pork was flavorful and not over&shy;whelmed by the sauce.
