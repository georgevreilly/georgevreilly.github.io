<p>I saw <a class="reference external" href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0218112">The Closer You Get</a>
yesterday. It's a comedy about desperate bachelors

<p>Paul Graham has an insightful essay on

in American high schools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So if in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are
smart kids so con&shy;sis&shy;tent&shy;ly unpopular? The answer, I think, is that they

<p>But in fact I didn't, not enough. There was something else I wanted

<p>Michael Savage is a radical right-wing talk-radio host and author, far more
obnxoxious than Rush Limbaugh. MSNBC has just <a class="reference external" href="http://msnbc.com/news/871672.asp">signed him to a weekly TV

Emma and I took part in a peace

although we did run into

the Seattle P-I. I would have thought more. It took eighty minutes from the
first marchers setting out to the last of the marchers getting a few blocks
away from the Seattle Center.</p>

<p>As part of the wave of peace rallies moving across the world today and
tomorrow, there will be a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.feb15.org/">Seattle Rally</a>. Gather
at the Seattle Center's In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al Fountain at 11:30am, rally at noon,

<p>Hans Blix presented his latest report to the UN this morning. No surprises.
Saddam is not being par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly co&shy;op&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tive, there are some &quot;proscribed&quot;
missiles, but they've found no evidence that Iraq is hiding prohibited
weapons. All the players held fast to their positions.</p>
<p>Colin Powell hammered home the point that if Saddam had nothing to hide,
the Iraqi scientists would be lining up to be in&shy;ter&shy;viewed by UN inspectors.
True, but that's still not a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/CasusBelliII.aspx">case for going to war</a>.</p>

<p>I've been meaning to rant about this for a while now, but haven't found the
time yet.</p>
<p>Last Friday, the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/">Center for Public Integrity</a>
announced that it had obtained a secret draft of
<a class="reference external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030320192431/http%3A//www.publicintegrity.org/dtaweb/report.asp?ReportID=506">Patriot Act II</a>.
Previously, it had been kept in almost complete secrecy, only being shown
to Dennis Hastert and Dick Cheney.</p>
<p>The Domestic Security En&shy;hance&shy;ment Act of 2003 (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailyrotten.com/source-docs/patriot2draft.html">full text</a>) is

delaying no&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion to targets of in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tions for up to three months,
secret subpoenas, crippling the Freedom of In&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion Act, deporting
American citizens, huge new powers for the FBI, and more.</p>

<p>Colin Powell went to the UN and made a case that Saddam has not disarmed
and that he continues to act in defiance of the UN. Not too surprising,
since that's what Blix has said. If Saddam had nothing to hide, he would
have cooperated with the UNMOVIC inspectors.</p>
<p>What Powell did not show is why Saddam's defiance warrants going to war.</p>
<p>Some doubt the veracity of Powell's case, citing the ease of forging
evidence. This is the same ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion that gave us the
