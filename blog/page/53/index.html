<p>As the Twelve Days of Christmas approach,
it's time once again to make fun of them.
Strictly speaking, we can't start until
December 25th, the first day of Christmas,
but the Xmas season starts earlier every year.</p>
<p>My favorite has long been Frank Kelly's <em>Christmas Countdown</em>,
which was a big hit in Ireland and Britain in the early 1980s.
It's couched as twelve in&shy;creas&shy;ing&shy;ly ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ed letters from
Gobnait O'Lughnasa to his friend Nuala. Here's Day Six:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nuala,</p>
<p>What are you trying to do to us ? It isn’t that we don’t appreciate
your generosity but the six geese have not alone nearly murdered the
calling birds but they laid their eggs on <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/12/12/12DaysOfChristmas.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

    <p>I'm in&shy;dif&shy;fer&shy;ent to most fantasy books, but I've been a fan of
George R.R. Martin's <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series,
since I read the first book,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553573403/georgvreill-20">A Game of Thrones</a>,
in 1997.
I read the second book
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553108034/georgvreill-20">A Clash of Kings</a>,
in 1999.
The third book
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055357342X/georgvreill-20">A Storm of Swords</a>
came out five years ago, and I've been awaiting
the fourth book,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553801503/georgvreill-20">A Feast for Crows</a>,
ever since.
After several post&shy;pone&shy;ments, it's finally out.</p>
<p>It's an epic tale of love, war, and intrigue.
Five Kings are fighting for control,
by sword, by guile, and sometimes by magic.
Strange creatures are rising in the frozen North, beyond the Wall.
Dragons are reap&shy;pear&shy;ing in the South.

    <p>Last Wednesday night, Emma emailed a dozen of our friends,
inviting them to join us for Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing dinner.
One reply arrived the next morning. Then nothing.</p>
<p>By Sunday evening, I had grown ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ed enough
to send out a snarky followup:</p>
<blockquote>
The courtesy of a belated reply would be ap&shy;pre&shy;ci&shy;at&shy;ed.
So far, we've got exactly one RSVP.</blockquote>
<p>It served its purpose. Replies cascaded in. Most, alas, said &quot;no&quot;;
they had other plans.</p>
<p>Would that this were an isolated incident.
Time and again, I've issued in&shy;vi&shy;ta&shy;tions that were not responded to.
A simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; is ideal.
A &quot;maybe&quot; is acceptable too,
especially if you follow up with a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no&quot;.</p>

    <p>I finally updated my blog to run on dasBlog 1.8.
Not too painful.
I unzipped the binary dis&shy;tri&shy;b&shy;u&shy;tion,
downloaded the content folder from my server to my local drive,
ran the provided upgrade utility,
and used WinMerge to update the con&shy;fig&shy;u&shy;ra&shy;tion files.</p>
<p>The most obvious change is that I'm using a new theme (skin),
which gives the site a very different look.
The previous default theme had problems if your browser window was too narrow,
due to some hardcoded table sizes (I think).</p>
<p>I also figured out how to post to dasBlog via w.bloggar.
I looked for info on con&shy;fig&shy;ur&shy;ing w.bloggar a few weeks ago, and couldn't find it then.</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has assisted George &amp; me in our attempt to
ready our home for hurricane evacuees.</p>
<p>Re&shy;gret&shy;tably, I have come to realize that I'm not emo&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly able to
make this commitment after all.  I thought I could open my home to
others, but I have sunk into a depression over the past few weeks that
has finally convinced me that I tried to bite off more than I <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/10/16/DecisionAboutEvacueeHousing.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

    <p>The basement looks far better tonight than last night.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I removed all the lower panels along the entire front wall,
and filled in the cracks with concrete.
I also bought some in&shy;ex&shy;pen&shy;sive folding doors that will require some
framing.</p>
<p>Today, Chuck came over after the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.binetseattle.org/meeting.html#brunch">BiNet Brunch</a>
and helped me put back up the panels
and finish all the painting.
It looks intensely yellow.
The dark blue carpet will help tone it down.</p>
<p>After I've framed the doors,
the carpet can be layed.
I'm busy all next weekend,
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mountaineers.org/photography/workshop.html">Tim Grey's Photoshop Seminar</a>,
so I'll have to do it in the evenings.</p>
<p>I have not yet been able to order the window.
Although the window was <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/10/03/BasementConcreteActions.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>This afternoon I would have said that the basement was close to being finished.
The painting was almost done, the carpet was due to come in tomorrow,
and the window will arrive in two-to-three weeks.
But we've had a setback.</p>
<p>Since the last update, I have finished painting the spare bedroom.
Emma will move in there as soon as I finish writing this post.
She was waiting for the paint fumes to dissipate.</p>
<p>After Lowe's sent someone out to measure the new window hole,
I boarded it up with some plywood and 2x4s.</p>
<p>Dipankar came over Wednesday afternoon and helped me paint the
basement -- at least the parts that <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/30/ItNeverRainsButItPours.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
