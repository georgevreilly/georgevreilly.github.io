<p>I have gout. It's an unpleasant form of arthritis. Once or twice a year,
one of my lower joints will swell up overnight. Usually, it's struck one of
my knees, though the last few attacks have all been in my feet. The knee
attacks have all been extremely painful initially and I've required
pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion painkillers to get to sleep at night. Just bending my knee a
few degrees is enough to make me break out in a cold sweat. For&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly,
after a few days, the pain decreases to the point where it's annoying but
tolerable.</p>

<p>I gave the following speech to Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters on October 1st, 2003, as Speech
#5, &quot;Vocal Variety&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SPOLIN GAMES</p>
<p>Spolin Games. That sounds like it could be a new set of titles for the
Xbox.</p>
<p>Far from it.</p>
<p>The Spolin Games are a set of improv theater games invented by Viola
Spolin in the nineteen-thirties, and refined by her for the next six
decades. These games are used in im&shy;pro&shy;vi&shy;sa&shy;tion&shy;al work, to help bring
out creativity and spon&shy;tane&shy;ity. Viola's son, Paul Sills, founded the
Second City improv theater company in Chicago back in the
nineteen-fifties.</p>

<p>Good article on how the Bush ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion is
<a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/133628_tito10.html">using language to influence public opinion</a>.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p><em>Civil service reform</em> means &quot;flex&shy;i&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty&quot; to replace civil service
protection with cronyism and patronage.</p>
<p><em>Pri&shy;va&shy;ti&shy;za&shy;tion</em> justifies the notion that cor&shy;po&shy;ra&shy;tions are more likely to
serve the public interest than publicly owned utilities, schools and
prisons.</p>
<p><em>Support the troops</em>, a brilliant concept, suggests that if you question
foreign policy or war policy, you have the deaths of our finest young men
and women in uniform on your hands. Objective: to stifle public dissent.</p>

<p>I found an in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing piece about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/22_politics.shtml">what makes a political con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tive</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four re&shy;searchers who culled through 50 years of research literature
about the psychology of con&shy;ser&shy;vatism report that at the core of
political con&shy;ser&shy;vatism is the resistance to change and a tolerance for
inequality, and that some of the common psy&shy;cho&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal factors linked to
political con&shy;ser&shy;vatism include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fear and aggression</li>
<li>Dogmatism and in&shy;tol&shy;er&shy;ance of ambiguity</li>

<p>As I mentioned in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2003/05/16/Naturalization.aspx">my Toast&shy;mas&shy;ter&shy;s' speech about nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;iza&shy;tion</a>, I decided
on September 11th, 2002 to become a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>This morning, I had my interview with the Bureau of Cit&shy;i&shy;zen&shy;ship and
Im&shy;mi&shy;gra&shy;tion Services (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bcis.gov/">BCIS</a>, formerly known as the INS).</p>
<p>This afternoon, I was sworn in as a U.S. citizen at the Seattle INS Office.
Eighty-three other new citizens were sworn in at the same time. Many were
Filipino, Vietnamese, Mexican, or Eastern European. Only three others, all
Brits, were from Western Europe. We were gathered into a stuffy room with
an overflow crowd of relatives and friends. <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/07/25/USCitizen.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
