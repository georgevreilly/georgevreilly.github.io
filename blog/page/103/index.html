<p>My colleague, Greg, and I spent all day debugging a build break in
some unit tests that exercise a webservice interface in legacy .NET 1.1 code.
Last night, the tests stopped working on our

developer teams moved from
our old offices at Fifth and Jackson in the In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al District
four blocks west to swanky offices in Pioneer Square.
The new offices are at the State building on the corner of
Occidental and Main, the pedes&shy;tri&shy;an&shy;ized block
with the antique stores and art galleries.
Occidental Park across the street has been re&shy;fur&shy;bished.
There are three coffee shops within two blocks,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/">Elliott Bay Books</a>
is one block west of us.
It's all very pleasant, with the exception of the large
number of homeless people.</p>

    <p>My brother David sent me this photo earlier today, of
me, him, and Michelle. I'm guessing that Michelle is less than a year old,
so it was taken sometime in 1971, which would make David four and me six.
(Our youngest brother, Mark, wasn't born until 1973.)</p>

<p>Emma thinks we're adorable and has already made this picture her desktop
background on her work computer.</p>
<p>Mark has another photo of the four of us, taken in 1978

<p>Joe Lieberman, the 2000 vice-pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial nominee, lost the Democratic primary
for his Senate seat tonight. He has said that he will run as an in&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dent.
In effect, he will not accept the will of the people.</p>
<p>Lieberman lost, in part, because of his continuing refusal to admit that
the Iraq war is a disaster, and in part because he has been a leading
enabler of the Republican agenda. Good riddance!</p>
