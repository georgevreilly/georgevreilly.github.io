<p>It snowed in Seattle yesterday.
We drove over to Sammamish last night to my <span class="caps">CEO</span>&#8217;s house
for the Holiday Party.
The snow wasn&#8217;t sticking to the roads,
so although visibility wasn&#8217;t great,
getting there and back was not&nbsp;difficult.</p>
<p>It was cold today and colder tonight.
I saw only a light dusting of snow fall today,
but the snow that was melting earlier has&nbsp;refrozen.</p>
<p>We had to go out this evening,
over to Burien to see Frank.
The main roads were fine,
but we had a slightly alarming descent
on a hill near us as we headed over there.
Coming home, we had a couple of unpleasant minutes
trying to get up a hill near Frank&#8217;s.

<p>Lots of new babies&nbsp;around.</p>
<p>Dilip in North Carolina emailed me the other day
and mentioned the recent birth of his daughter, Anuragini.
And Alan in Dublin emailed me this morning,
to tell me of the birth of his daughter,&nbsp;Beth.</p>
<p>My sister, Michelle Bowles, is due to give birth on the 19th
to the first Reilly grandchild.
We arrive in Dublin on the 21st.
First babies tend to be born late,
so we may get there before the baby does.
She and David have elected not to learn the gender of the baby,
so I addressed their Christmas card to &quot;Michelle, David, and&nbsp;<span class="caps">TBD</span>&quot;.</p>

<p>(As I mentioned <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2008/12/12/Kindle.html">last night</a>,
I read Ac&shy;celeran&shy;do (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando_(book)">Wikipedia</a>) in Stanza on my iPhone on the&nbsp;bus.)</p>
<p><em>Ac&shy;celeran&shy;do</em> is a set of connected short stories

around the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">Sin&shy;gu&shy;lar&shy;i&shy;ty</a>.
The ideas fly thick and fast (and somewhat con&shy;fus&shy;ing&shy;ly):
minds uploaded into virtual machines, nan&shy;otech&shy;nol&shy;o&shy;gy,
posthumans, lobsters brainscans uplifted into space,
an in&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dent-minded <span class="caps">AI</span> in a cat&#8217;s body, economics,&nbsp;…</p>
<p>Thought-provoking and&nbsp;en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing.</p>

<p>Emma had a chance to play with Jacob&#8217;s Kindle (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA">Amazon</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle">Wikipedia</a>) today,
while I looked&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>The electronic paper screen is one of the big selling points.
We found the text to be very readable, albeit black-and-white.
It works very well for its primary use case—dis&shy;play&shy;ing
book pages with minimal battery drain—but it&#8217;s sluggish when updating&nbsp;menus.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not impressed by the design of the case.
The buttons on the side are far too big;
the keyboard at the bottom is ridiculous.
It would be in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing to see what Apple could&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexcycle_Stanza">Stanza</a> on my iPhone for the last couple of months,
mostly to read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.feedbooks.com/book/228">Ac&shy;celeran&shy;do</a> on the bus.

<p>Since the summer, I&#8217;ve been working on and off on a mobile site for Cozi.
Chris, one of our interns, did a lot of the initial work.
Getting it to a deployable state has
been my primary focus over the last few&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to say that as of today <a class="reference external" href="http://m.cozi.com/">m.cozi.com</a> is in public beta.
Will wrote a little about it at the <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.cozi.com/coziblog/2008/12/cozi-mobile.html">Cozi Blog</a>;
take a look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cozi.com/Promo-Cozi-Mobile.htm">promo</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, the mobile site supports shopping lists and the calendar.
In the calendar, you can view, create, and edit your ap&shy;point&shy;ments.

<p>We&#8217;ve gone high-def over the last month.
First, Emma bought a <a class="reference external" href="http://www2.panasonic.com/consumer-electronics/support/Televisions/VIERA-Plasma-HDTVs/model.TH-42PZ80U.S">42&quot; 1080p plasma Panasonic <span class="caps">HDTV</span></a>
to replace the 32&quot; <span class="caps">CRT</span> <span class="caps">TV</span> in our living room.
Although it&#8217;s wider, it&#8217;s not over&shy;whelm&shy;ing,
as the slender box sits further back.
The picture&#8217;s pretty good—at least when you give it a good&nbsp;signal.</p>
<p>To take advantage of it required a cascade of upgrades.
Our old TiVo served us well for eight years;
ap&shy;point&shy;ment <span class="caps">TV</span> has long been alien to us.
It&#8217;s dis&shy;con&shy;nect&shy;ed now, replaced the other day
by a DirecTV Plus <span class="caps">DVR</span> and a new satellite dish.
I had heard bad things about the older DirecTV DVRs,
but I have no complaints about this one&nbsp;yet.</p>

<p>Eric had the temerity last week to <a class="reference external" href="http://offby1-whining.blogspot.com/2008/12/pentaho.html">gripe</a> on his blog
about a certain open source business in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gence product,
and got swarmed by irate defenders.
Apparently he showed up in their Google Alerts.
Some of the posters were helpful,
but the <em>ad hominem</em> attackers were more&nbsp;en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing:</p>
<blockquote>
Your blog has had 22 posts in the past year, and your blogroll includes
absolutely no one of note in the open source world. So I think it’s
safe to say that while you are pointing out a perception that they
should address in some way, that your opinion isn’t worth much.</blockquote>

I said that it was the first in a series of daily posts for <a class="reference external" href="http://nablopomo.ning.com/">NaBloPoMo</a>,
the National Blog Posting Month, which I had just found out&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>Here I am a month later, having posted something every single evening.
I covered humor; movie and book reviews; being the #1 tech blog (now #2);
politics; Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing; food; personal stuff; and even some technical posts.&nbsp;Whew!</p>
<p>Why bother? As with the two-year-old exercise in book reviews,
it was a personal challenge to come up with a post every single evening

<p>We saw a production of David Sedaris&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattlepublictheater.org/events-santaland.htm">Santaland Diaries</a>
at the Bathhouse Theater tonight. Funny&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we walked over to the Greenlake Bluwater Restaurant
to get a spot of dinner.
We both ordered Tuscan White Bean soup for a starter,
Emma had the Turkey Pot Pie,
and mine was the&nbsp;Fettucine.</p>
<p>The soup was fine and my fettucine was okay.
Emma&#8217;s pot pie had problems.
The potatoes were raw and it had a funny lemony aftertaste.
She pushed the plate away and waited for the waitress to come by.
The waitress apologized and brought Emma the menu.
Emma opted for the meatloaf, since that would come quickly.
The manager apologized and offered us a <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/07/CantTakeHerAnywhere.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Simon Canderous, dorky newbie at the un&shy;der&shy;fund&shy;ed, secretive
Department of Ex&shy;tra&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nary Affairs in New York City,
in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gates the death of a beautiful ghost
and the apparently re&shy;spectable cultists at the
Sectarian Defense League.
He has the gift (or curse) of psy&shy;chom&shy;e&shy;try:
when he touches something,
he can divine its&nbsp;history.</p>
<p>This book wobbles between not very black comedy
and straight urban fantasy,
and doesn&#8217;t really succeed as&nbsp;either.</p>
