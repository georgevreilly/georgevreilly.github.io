<p>Candidate Obama talked a great line in gay rights,
selling himself as a “fierce advocate”.
He'd get rid of the Defense of Marriage Act,
Don't Ask Don't Tell, and more.</p>
<p>President Obama has been a big dis&shy;ap&shy;point&shy;ment on gay rights.
He hasn't done anything about DADT,
he hasn't spoken out about gay marriage,
he hasn't made any gay ap&shy;point&shy;ments.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2009/06/17/gay_rights/">John Aravosis</a> has a good roundup at Salon.</p>
<p>But now a shitstorm has blown up.
On Friday, the Department of Justice filed a brief in defense of DOMA.
First of all, the DoJ is not actually required to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.americablog.com/2009/06/choice-to-defend-doma-and-its.html">defend all laws</a>.
More im&shy;por&shy;tant&shy;ly, the brief was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/16/opinion/16tue1.html">gra&shy;tu&shy;itous&shy;ly offensive</a>,

<p>People are outraged.

For expediency, we in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.WildGeeseSeattle.org/">Wild Geese Players</a> usually
perform our reading at the nearest weekend.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0617/1224248982007.html">Irish Times</a> writes its usual report of a crowd of posers
re-enacting fragments of <em>Ulysses</em> in Dublin. Perhaps the best line:</p>
<blockquote>
Back in the city centre, a sign outside Davy Byrne’s advertised
a Bloomsday special: Gorgonzola cheese sandwiches and burgundy for €12.90.
Someone nearby complained loudly that prices had gone up since 1904.</blockquote>
<p>A Spanish translator of <em>Ulysses</em> remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You don’t have to be a Joycean to enjoy this day,” he said.

<p>Paul Christo&shy;pher, sep&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;ge&shy;nar&shy;i&shy;an and former superspy,
was last seen in a remote Chinese province.
His ashes are delivered to his cousin Horace, also a retired spy,
who is not convinced that the ashes belong to Paul.
Then he learns that Paul is on the trail of Ibn Awad,
a mad sultan with nukes who covets a first-century manuscript
(a Roman spy&shy;mas&shy;ter's report on Jesus) that is thought to be
in the possession of Paul's 94-year-old mother, who hasn't seen since 1940,

<p>I filled six densely packed barrels with yard waste today,
before and after the victory barbecue for the Wild Geese Players.
No wonder I'm tired.</p>
<p>Three barrels from the pile of clippings left over
from cir&shy;cum&shy;cis&shy;ing the camelia tree on Memorial Day weekend,
and another three from the big bush that Emma hates in the front rock garden.
The latter barely looks pruned at all.</p>

<p>Our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2009.html">2009 Bloomsday reading</a> is over!
I thought it went very well.
We had quite a large audience by our stan&shy;dard&shy;s—about 30 people,
we got a lot of laughs, and most of them stayed until the end.</p>
<p>Of all the spaces that we've performed in, I like the University Bookstore the best.
The events area is sunny, airy, and spacious,
and easily discovered by customers in the store.
The staff were very helpful and easy to work with.
I'd prefer not to do another event on the same day
as the University of Wash&shy;ing&shy;ton's Com&shy;menc&shy;ment, however.</p>

<p>This morning, the video adapters on my Vista dev box were resetting
2–3&nbsp;times per <em>minute</em>.</p>
<p>After a pile of Windows Updates landed on my machine at 3am yesterday,
it would oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly freeze solid for a few seconds.
Once in a while, all the monitors would go black briefly, then restore.
Each time, I would see a status update pop up from the system tray,
&quot;Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly recovered.&quot;</p>
<p>This was irritating enough that I downloaded the latest NVidia drivers this morning,

Southmarch is under siege by the fairy army

Briony is on the run, fleeing for her life.
Her twin, Barrick, is lost, mentally and physically, behind the fairy lines.

<p><em>Ob&shy;jec&shy;ti&shy;fied</em> is a doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary about industrial design
and the man&shy;u&shy;fac&shy;tured objects that litter our lives.
In interviews with some leading designers,
Hustwit brings forth such topics as
our emotional attachment to those objects;
the ephemer&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ty and planned ob&shy;soles&shy;ence of most of this “stuff”;
the approaches of different designers;
designing the man&shy;u&shy;fac&shy;tur&shy;ing process as well as the object;
how good design often almost dis&shy;ap&shy;pears;
sus&shy;tain&shy;abil&shy;i&shy;ty, when most objects end up in landfill;
in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tion and interface design;
etc.</p>
<p>The danger with such a broad survey
is that you can't do justice to anything.
I was left wanting to know more about many of the topics.
In the Q&amp;A afterwards, Hustwit mentioned that <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/06/11/ReviewObjectified.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I had noticed for several months that I was having a little difficulty with smaller print,
and a visit to the op&shy;tometrist confirmed that I needed reading glasses.
Now I'm near-sighted and far-sighted, all at the same time.</p>
<p>The new glasses took some getting used to.
I had been accustomed to looking through any part of the lens.
Now I had to tilt my head downwards rather than simply turn my eyes down,
if I wanted to look at the floor,
or I'd be looking through the short-distance reading portion.</p>
