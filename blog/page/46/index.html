<p>On Friday, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/04/04/IowaGayMarriageRuling.aspx">Iowa Supreme Court</a> struck down their state's
gay marriage ban.
Today, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20090407/NEWS03/90407016/1095/news03">Vermont Leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;ture</a> legalized gay marriage.</p>
<p>It's been a great week for fairness.
We still have a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20090407/NEWS03/90407022">long way to go</a>:
29 states have con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&shy;al amendments banning gay marriage.</p>
<p>I'm sure the right wing are beating the fund-raising drums for all they're worth.
We can expect more Propo&shy;si&shy;tion 8-style backlashes, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>But the news still made my day.</p>

<p>Moments ago, I completed the second draft of the Circe Part I script
for this year's Ulysses reading.</p>
<p>The chapter is couched in the form of a play,
making it relatively straight&shy;for&shy;ward to convert to a staged reading.
There are, however, huge numbers of “stage di&shy;rec&shy;tion&shy;s”,
often ironic, generally unactable:
A vast, detailed procession in Bloom's honor;
Bloom burning at the stake;
camels offering mangoes to Molly;
and much, much more.</p>
<p>In addition, there are over one hundred characters,
most of whom have a line or two, then disappear.
They need to be introduced somehow.</p>
<p>So I added two narrators to handle all of this.
They steer the reading along,
adding much-needed context to aid <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/04/06/CirceSecondDraft.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>In Seattle, it is said that moss grows on the north side of the rain.
To be sure, moss thrives in the shadier parts of our yard.</p>
<p>On a cold, dry February day,
I rented a pressure washer with the intention
of scouring the moss from the ground
and the flaking paint from the garage walls.
Although it was quite effective at removing moss,
it made a godawful mess.
There were muddy flecks of moss everywhere.
Against the flaking paint, it made little impression
and I still have to deal with that.
I had dealt with perhaps a third of the moss
when the pressure washer died.
I got a partial refund, but <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/04/06/RemovingMoss.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>It's been a long, dreary winter in Seattle.
After a horrible, wet Saturday,
last Sunday was glorious, the first nice day in weeks.
Then the cold and rain came back.
It snowed on April 1st, for Pete's sake.</p>
<p>And now we have another lovely weekend,
with promised highs in the high Sixties tomorrow.
I did some yard work today
and cleaned the grill and outdoor furniture.
We've invited a handful of friends over for dinner tomorrow night.</p>

<p>I am greatly heartened by today's news of Iowa's Supreme Court
unan&shy;i&shy;mous&shy;ly striking down the state's gay marriage ban.
The passage of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/11/16/AgainstGayMarriageDontHaveOne.aspx">Propo&shy;si&shy;tion 8</a> in California was a setback.
The Iowa Court made a strong <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pamshouseblend.com/diary/10226/iowa-court-eviscerates-rightwing-talking-points">ruling</a>,
gutting the arguments against same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe now that in&shy;ter&shy;ra&shy;cial marriage was illegal
in many states until 1967.
President Obama's parents could not have married in those states.
We look back at that now with bemusement and a little horror.
The opposition, then as now, was led by cultural con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tives,
making <a class="reference external" href="http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2004_fall/forde.htm">religious arguments</a>.</p>
<p>Someday soon, we'll look back at the gay marriage debate
with the same bemusement and wonder what all the fuss <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/04/04/IowaGayMarriageRuling.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>About three weeks ago, I answered a question on Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow
about generating the <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/646068/find-most-readable-colour-of-text-that-is-drawn-on-a-coloured-surface/646328#646328">most readable color</a> of text
on a colored background.</p>
<p>I suggested flipping the top bit of each component,
<tt class="docutils literal">(r ^ 0x80, g ^ 0x80, b ^ 0x80)</tt>.
This has the same effect as adding 128 if the component is less than 128,
and sub&shy;tract&shy;ing 128 otherwise.</p>
<p>Another way to think about it is to imagine the 256x256x256 color cube.
Inside that cube, erect another cube half as wide.
One corner is at your original color
and the diagonally opposite corner is the one computed above.</p>
<p>The questioner liked my answer the best,
but I decided to experiment further.

<p>I love Spring.
The winter recedes, the weather grows warmer,
the young plants appear, the dormant trees bloom,
and all is right with the world.</p>
<p>I dread Spring.
My nose itches, it runs, it blocks up, it explodes.</p>
<p>This year, my eyes itch too.
A lot.
It's really, um, irritating.</p>

The brick Tudors, like ours, were built in the 1930s.
The houses adjoining mine were built in the years after World War II.</p>
<p>There's a house for sale a few doors down that's very like ours.
We snooped around on Sunday during the open house.</p>
<p>Our house was built in 1931; the other, the year before.
Ours is slightly deeper, but the floor plans are very similar.
Theirs has no eye&shy;catch&shy;ing yellow brick trim.
Our kitchen was remodeled in the sixties, taking over part of the next room.
Theirs never was and it's tiny.

    <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.betterthangrep.com/"></a>
<p>On a Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow question about <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21725/favorite-gvim-plugins-scripts">favorite Vim plugins</a>, I learned about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.betterthangrep.com/">Ack</a>,
a re&shy;place&shy;ment for grep that's smarter about searching source trees.</p>
<p>Ack is written in Perl.
The built-in <tt class="docutils literal">:vimgrep</tt> is rather slow.
It seems to have some Vim-specific overhead,
such as creating swap files and executing <tt class="docutils literal">BufRead</tt> autocmds.
Ack is noticeably faster,
though somewhat slower than GNU grep.</p>
<p>Which would you rather type to search a tree,
ignoring the <tt class="docutils literal">.svn</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">.git</tt> subtrees?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>ack -i -l foobar
<span class="nv">$ </span>grep --exclude<span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;*.svn*&#39;</span> --exclude<span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;*.git*&#39;</span> -i -l -r foobar .
</pre></div>
<p>The ack takes 6 seconds to search 4500 files, while the grep completes in 2.
This does not count the time that I spent trying <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/25/AckBetterThanGrep.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
