<p>2008 closes, leaving economic wreckage in its wake.
Personally and pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly, it&#8217;s been a good year.
At the national level, it&#8217;s been both a very good year and a disastrous one.
Obama&#8217;s historic victory is offset by the imploding&nbsp;economy.</p>
<p>My health remains good, I&#8217;m a little fitter than I was a year ago.
I&#8217;ve notched up a few personal milestones,
such as receiving my Competent Com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tor award at Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters and
becoming the secretary of Freely Speaking&nbsp;Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters.</p>
<p>My friends and family are, mostly, doing well.
My sister is (still!) on the verge of having her first child.
Emma&#8217;s health is never great:

The hunch&shy;backed lawyer Matthew Shardlake
has been sent to York by Archbishop Cranmer to meet the Royal Progress,
where Henry <span class="caps">VIII</span> is to accept formal surrender from those
who had earlier rebelled.
Shardlake is to hear petitions on the king&#8217;s behalf,
but really he is there to ensure that a high-ranking con&shy;spir&shy;a&shy;tor
is brought safely back to the Tower of London.
He stumbles upon a cache of secret papers,
which leads to a series of attempts upon his&nbsp;life.</p>

<p>Michelle and her husband David B† came over for dinner.
Her baby is now nine days overdue

<p>It&#8217;s been very hard to hook up with my old friends here.
We landed seven days ago and the only other meet up
was a couple of pints with Jimmy on Monday.
They&#8217;re (almost) all middle-aged, mortgaged, married, and bechilded,
and otherwise busy with their own lives.

<p>When I was a boy, anytime we said ‘Dundrum’ (a suburb of Dublin),
it was with a snigger, because it was synonymous in our minds
with the <a class="reference external" href="http://wikimapia.org/72462/Central-Mental-Hospital-Dundrum">mental asylum</a> located there.
Nowadays, Dundrum is much better known as the home of a large
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dundrum.ie/">shopping centre</a>.
I&#8217;m so out of touch with Dublin that I hadn&#8217;t realized
that there was a major new shopping centre there.
I assumed that people were talking about the unim&shy;pres&shy;sive
little centre that I remembered there from my childhood.
Until today, when we went there to return the
mobile phone that we had given my mother for&nbsp;Christmas.</p>
<p>Dundrum was, indeed, a madhouse.

<p>Normally, we have Shuttle Express take us to Sea-Tac airport,
but they were completely booked up when I tried to make a reser&shy;va&shy;tion
earlier in the week.
Lyndol very kindly came over at 6am and drove us down to the&nbsp;airport.</p>
<p>Our plane left an hour late from Seattle,
as it came in late the night before
and the crew had to wait for the statutory <span class="caps">FTC</span> minimum stopover.
The late departure from Seatac was no problem,
since we had a scheduled 5-hour layover in Philadelpia.
After being shoehorned into the plane,
we needed to stretch and wandered through several of the terminals.
The only excitement was when I realized an hour <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/21/InDublin.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I tried to take the bus into work today, but no bus showed.
I later learned that the #39 had been “tem&shy;porar&shy;i&shy;ly suspended”.
Emma drove into downtown Seattle, getting off at the James St. exit.
James is steep and it was closed to traffic.
She let me out at 7th and James and
I walked down to the Smith&nbsp;Tower.</p>
<p>Other people were <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/392969_bus20.html">not so lucky</a> on the steeper streets,
as you can see in the photo of a bus hanging over the&nbsp;interstate.</p>

<p>When we went to bed on Wednesday night, most of the weekend&#8217;s snow had melted.
We were woken around 5:30am by two large <a class="reference external" href="http://beaconhill.seattle.wa.us/2008/12/18/did-you-hear-that/">thunder claps</a>,
attributed to <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/392821_storm19.html">thun&shy;der&shy;snow</a>.
The snow was falling again and fell for most of the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>We were sensible and stayed home.
So, it seems, did almost everyone else at Cozi.
I worked remotely for part of the day.
Otherwise, we watched movies.
I felt no desire to go outside and make snowmen,
though we certainly could&nbsp;have.</p>
<p>We fly to Ireland on Saturday morning.
I&#8217;m a little worried about getting to the&nbsp;airport.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m Irish. I was raised on butter.
Not margarine. Butter.
Good Irish butter.
Yellow, creamy, with a little&nbsp;salt.</p>
<p>Melted onto toast.
A soft yellow layer on bread.
A pat of butter on your potatoes.
Fry your eggs in butter.
Let butter melt on your&nbsp;chips.</p>
<p>I knew butter was important in baking,
but I didn&#8217;t realize until <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/dining/17bake.html">today</a> how carefully it should be&nbsp;treated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common mistakes made by home bakers, pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;als say,
have to do with the care and handling of one ingredient: butter.
Creaming butter correctly, keeping butter doughs cold,
and starting with fresh, good-tasting butter
are vital details that pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;als take for granted,
and home bakers often&nbsp;miss.</p>
<p>Butter is basically an emulsion of water in <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/18/Butter.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>
