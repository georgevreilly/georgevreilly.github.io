<p>I don't, as a rule, pay a great deal of attention to Canadian politics.
I was vaguely aware that something unusual is going on there this week.
Then Emma pointed me to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yarnharlot.ca/blog/archives/2008/12/03/what_is_happening_in_canada.html">Yarn Harlot</a>'s ex&shy;pla&shy;na&shy;tion
of what's happened.</p>
<p>In brief, for the last two years,
Stephen Harper's minority government has been playing
a high-stakes game, repeatedly forcing the opposition parties
to either vote with him or force an election, which they
would likely lose.</p>
<p>Last week, as soon as Parliament resumed after October's general election,
Harper put forth an &quot;economic strategy&quot;, which included removing
federal election subsidies to all par&shy;ties—&shy;ef&shy;fec&shy;tive&shy;ly hobbling the opposition.
The opposition were deeply unhappy about that,
and also <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/05/Proroguery.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Emma worked at WaMu as a software tester for three years.
I'm sure that if she were still there, she'd be one of them.
Most of her friends from that time have moved on;
just as well.</p>
<p>A few years ago, WaMu seemed too big to fail.
Now? Circling the toilet bowl.</p>
<p>Our whole economy seems like it was one giant Ponzi scheme,
with everyone selling worthless paper to everyone else.
It's hard to tell how much was wilful ignorance,

Driz&shy;zling—not too heavy—I'll ride to work.
Pack my clothes into the panier bag.
Spandex tights, coat, yellow jacket, helmet, gloves: on they go.
Bike's in the garage, seems okay, slap on the bag.
Pull it out, reset the odometer.
17 minutes today?</p>
<p>Ignite the blinky lights, pull away.
Down the side roads, until I'm compelled to take the arterial.
Press the crosswalk button, wait for a break in the traffic.
Two minutes, three, does this fucking light <em>ever</em> change?
Off like a shot, past Jefferson Park.
Maybe they'll finish by next summer.
Hit the next light at 2:30.
A long, gentle uphill for the next 8 minutes.

<p>There's little that I miss about Irish cooking.
One notable exception is Brown Bread aka Brown Soda Bread.
I don't know of any bakery that makes it in the States,
though I've found it at a couple of Irish pubs.
The main difficulty in making it is
finding the coarse-ground wholemeal flour.
The usual fine-ground stuff has the wrong texture.</p>
<p>I know of only one place in the Seattle area that carries
the right flour and that's
The Grainery, 13629 1st Ave S, Burien, WA 98168; (206) 244-5015.
I bought some flour there today,
made a loaf, and brought the loaf and a 10lb bag of flour
to an Irish friend's birthday <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/11/30/IrishBrownBread.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

just about <em>every</em> cellphone and browser has some of his software

where software that I've con&shy;tributed to can be found.</p>

<p>My first Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing took place nineteen years ago.
I was a 24-year-old graduate student,
recently arrived at Brown.
One of my of&shy;fice&shy;mates and her husband insisted
that I and a Swedish grad student
accompany them to her parents' house for Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing dinner.
It snowed that day, the first snow of the winter.
We set off in what seemed like a blizzard,
up I-95 into Mass&shy;a&shy;chu&shy;setts.
The day was cold, but the reception was warm.
A houseful of Patrice's relatives made us most welcome.</p>
<p>Ever since, I've always sat down to
a large, convivial dinner at Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing.
At first, others welcomed me into their homes.

How to Carve a Turkey
</div><p>Just in case you need some tips for tomorrow's feast.</p>
<p>We're hosting a dinner.
My Irish friends, Paul and Maggie,
who moved to San Jose at the end of last year,
have come up for a few days.
It will be their first Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing together in the States.
We'll also be joined by Frank &amp; Lyndol,
Raven &amp; Iain, and Peter &amp; Carol.</p>
<p>We're cooking the turkey at high heat,
using Barbara Kafka's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bkafka.com/Recipes/roastturkey.html">500F recipe</a>.
The others are bringing everything else.
Yum.</p>

<p>I've been very happy with my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/07/16/MacBookMakeover.aspx">MacBook Pro</a>.
It's my primary home machine,
sitting on the living room coffee table,
and getting far more use than the desktop system
in my office upstairs.</p>
<p>But it rarely leaves the house.
It's big–a 17&quot; screen–and it's heavy.
I seldom carry it anywhere and I hardly ever bring it to a coffee shop.</p>
<p>I bought myself a <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/09/netbooks-evolvi.html">netbook</a> last month, an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.laptopmag.com/review/laptops/asus-eee-pc-100h.aspx">Asus Eee 1000H</a>:
