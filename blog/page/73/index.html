    <p>Twenty years ago tomorrow, I attended <a class="reference external" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DA1538F932A15752C0A96F948260">Bush Senior&#8217;s In&shy;au&shy;gu&shy;ra&shy;tion</a>.
By&nbsp;accident.</p>
<p>I was on my first solo trip to the United States,
having arrived in New York the previous week.
There I had purchased a 30-day unlimited standby ticket with Delta.
It cost me only $400, as I could produce my round-the-world&nbsp;ticket.</p>
<p>For no par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly good reason, I decided to start
the 30 days with a trip to Washington <span class="caps">DC</span>.
There were museums there and it was&nbsp;nearby.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t been paying close attention to the news, and
it was only when I got to Washington that I realized that
George <span class="caps">H.W.</span> Bush&#8217;s in&shy;au&shy;gu&shy;ra&shy;tion was to be be held the next day.
Even so, <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/01/20/TheOtherInauguration.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Milk was a middle-aged closet case who moved to San Francisco in the early 1970s,
became po&shy;lit&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly active, and started running for office,
un&shy;suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly at first.
“The Mayor of Castro Street” was elected to the San Francisco Board of
Su&shy;per&shy;vi&shy;sors in 1977,
the first openly gay man to hold public office in the United States.
A year later, only days after the anti-gay Cal&shy;i&shy;forn&shy;ian ballot initiative,
Propo&shy;si&shy;tion 6, went down to defeat,
Milk and Mayor George Moscone were murdered by ex-Supervisor Dan&nbsp;White.</p>
<p>Sean Penn is convincing as Harvey Milk,

Metro is proposing to close the one really useful route,
the #39 which takes me to work in Pioneer Square.
The #60 gets me to 12th and S. Jackson,
nearly a mile from work.
The #36 only runs down 15th in the evenings;
otherwise it runs through Jefferson Park, half a mile&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>The new #50 route will be a poor re&shy;place&shy;ment,

<p>Last Sunday President-elect Barack Obama was asked whether he would seek an
in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion of possible crimes by the Bush ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion. “I don’t
believe that anybody is above the law,” he responded, but “we need to look
forward as opposed to looking&nbsp;backwards.”</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but if we don’t have an inquest into what happened during the
Bush years — and nearly everyone has taken Mr. Obama’s remarks to mean that
we won’t — this means that those who hold power are indeed above the law
because they don’t face any con&shy;se&shy;quences if they abuse their&nbsp;power.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always been a fast reader, faster than most people.
I&#8217;ve read and reviewed 176 books in just over two years,
or about two books a week.
That doesn&#8217;t count newspapers, magazines, blogs, and other online&nbsp;reading.</p>
<p>When I was 10, I had an operation on both my feet
and I spent all summer with my legs in plaster.
My mother had to go to the library every day
because they&#8217;d only let her take out three books at a time for me.
On the flight back from Ireland two weeks ago,
I read <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/04/ReviewAbsentFriends.html">two</a> 500-page <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/03/ReviewTheSunriseLands.html">books</a>.

Íñigo, his follower and later biographer, is still too young to bear arms,

The Spanish empire is on the decline.
Spain has been fighting in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Netherlands">Spanish Nether&shy;lands</a> for sixty years

<p>I seldom get bad colds, but I caught one on the plane back from Ireland,
and it&#8217;s left me drained of energy for the last ten days.
Jet lag and Frank&#8217;s death surely con&shy;tributed too.&nbsp;Feh!</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll be up to cycling into work tomorrow.
Between the snow, being in Ireland for two weeks, and this cold,
it&#8217;s been almost a month since I last rode&nbsp;in.</p>

The people don&#8217;t trust the banks much.
In an effort to get money flowing, he introduces paper money to Ankh-Morpork.
Lipwig, like his creator, is an acute observer of people,
and pulls it off against the&nbsp;odds.</p>
