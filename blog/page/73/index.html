<p>At 12:44am Monday (Irish Time), Michelle gave birth to a 9lb 8oz boy.
Mother and son are healthy but exhausted.
I&#8217;m not sure quite how long the actual labor lasted;
but I think she started late on&nbsp;Saturday.</p>
<p>My nephew is, as yet, unnamed.
David and Michelle have yet to find a boy&#8217;s name that both of them really like.
Under Irish law, they have three months to do so,
but Michelle hopes to pick a name within a few days at&nbsp;most.</p>

I like this one the&nbsp;best.</p>

not my brother-in-law David.
I&#8217;m telling you, one of them&#8217;s got to go: it&#8217;s just too&nbsp;confusing.]</p>

<p>Rozan weaves together two stories here, past and&nbsp;present.</p>
<p>Seven children, four boys and three girls,
grow up together on Staten Island in the 1960s and 70s.
In early adulthood, one of the young men ac&shy;ci&shy;den&shy;tal&shy;ly kills another,
then is killed in prison.
A third boy, Jimmy McCaffrey, becomes estranged from the others
and moves to Manhattan where he rises in the Fire&nbsp;Department.</p>
<p>Jimmy dies in the Twin Towers on 9/11,
doing what he did best: saving people.
A month later, a washed-up newspaper reporter writes a story

The focus has switched to a younger set of characters,
the first generation to grow up after the “Change”,
the event that knocked the world back into the Dark&nbsp;Ages.</p>
<p>A traveler arrives in Oregon from the East, bearing a compelling prophecy that
requires Rudi Mackenzie to travel to Nantucket, the apparent source of the Change.
A group of nine (the number is tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al) head eastwards.

<p>It&#8217;s now two weeks since Michelle&#8217;s due date.
She went into Holles Street Maternity Hospital this morning to have her baby induced.
No progress yet.
That kid doesn&#8217;t want to come out!
It may be Sunday before it&#8217;s&nbsp;born.</p>
<p>Ironically, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/">Wild Geese Players</a> read the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2008.html">Oxen of the Sun</a>
chapter of Ulysses last summer,
which takes place in Holles Street.
Bloom goes to visit his friend Mina Purefoy, who&#8217;s been three days in labor,
and meets up with a crowd of drunken medical students and Stephen Dedalus.
Between them, they manage to re&shy;ca&shy;pit&shy;u&shy;late the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of the English&nbsp;language.</p>

<p>When my parents visited me in September,
I bought them a second laptop and an external drive for backup.
One laptop stays in Dublin, the other in Cape Town where they spend much of their year.
Both laptops are in Dublin with me at present,
so that I can clean them up and get them in sync.
(I had to remove some very obscure registry settings to
get one <span class="caps">DVD</span> drive working again.&nbsp;&lt;sigh/&gt;)</p>
<p>Their backup needs are simple.
Both of them have web-based email at Yahoo!.
The only personal data on either computer is photos.
Inevitably the photos are out of sync between the two&nbsp;machines.</p>

<p>2008 closes, leaving economic wreckage in its wake.
Personally and pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly, it&#8217;s been a good year.
At the national level, it&#8217;s been both a very good year and a disastrous one.
Obama&#8217;s historic victory is offset by the imploding&nbsp;economy.</p>
<p>My health remains good, I&#8217;m a little fitter than I was a year ago.
I&#8217;ve notched up a few personal milestones,
such as receiving my Competent Com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tor award at Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters and
becoming the secretary of Freely Speaking&nbsp;Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters.</p>
<p>My friends and family are, mostly, doing well.
My sister is (still!) on the verge of having her first child.

The hunch&shy;backed lawyer Matthew Shardlake
has been sent to York by Archbishop Cranmer to meet the Royal Progress,
where Henry <span class="caps">VIII</span> is to accept formal surrender from those
who had earlier rebelled.
Shardlake is to hear petitions on the king&#8217;s behalf,
but really he is there to ensure that a high-ranking con&shy;spir&shy;a&shy;tor
is brought safely back to the Tower of London.
He stumbles upon a cache of secret papers,
which leads to a series of attempts upon his&nbsp;life.</p>

<p>Michelle and her husband David B† came over for dinner.
Her baby is now nine days overdue
and she&#8217;s more than ready to give&nbsp;birth.</p>

who is currently living at my parents&#8217; house in&nbsp;Dublin.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been very hard to hook up with my old friends here.
We landed seven days ago and the only other meet up
was a couple of pints with Jimmy on Monday.
They&#8217;re (almost) all middle-aged, mortgaged, married, and bechilded,
and otherwise busy with their own lives.

<p>When I was a boy, anytime we said ‘Dundrum’ (a suburb of Dublin),
it was with a snigger, because it was synonymous in our minds
with the <a class="reference external" href="http://wikimapia.org/72462/Central-Mental-Hospital-Dundrum">mental asylum</a> located there.
Nowadays, Dundrum is much better known as the home of a large
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dundrum.ie/">shopping centre</a>.
I&#8217;m so out of touch with Dublin that I hadn&#8217;t realized
that there was a major new shopping centre there.
I assumed that people were talking about the unim&shy;pres&shy;sive
little centre that I remembered there from my childhood.
Until today, when we went there to return the
mobile phone that we had given my mother for&nbsp;Christmas.</p>
<p>Dundrum was, indeed, a madhouse.
