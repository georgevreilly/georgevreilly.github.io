<p>I attended the Approve Referendum 71 community or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tion meeting
this evening and came away with several good ideas.</p>
<p>Emma and I are going to organize a fundraiser in late September or early October.
Stay tuned.</p>
<p>I'm getting Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters and BiNet Seattle to officially
endorse the <a class="reference external" href="http://approve71.org">Approve Referendum 71</a> campaign.</p>
<p>Large businesses like Microsoft and Boeing endorsed the campaign yesterday.
I'm told a number of small businesses have too.
I'm going to ask our CEO to endorse the campaign.
Robbie was willing to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/08/19/SenatorPattyMurrayAtCozi.aspx">host Patty Murray at Cozi</a>
and to appear in her press releases, so why not.</p>

<p>I created a <a class="reference external" href="http://twibbon.com/join/Approve-Referendum-71">Twibbon overlay for Approve71.org</a>.</p>
<p>The results look great on Twitter and Twibbon.</p>
<p>Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, if I save the image and upload it to Facebook as my profile picture,
it doesn't look so good.
Even if I use the FB UI to pan around in the image, the cropping ruins it.</p>
<p>I just mailed <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stormideas.com/">stormideas</a>, the people behind Twibbon,
asking if they could do something similar for Facebook profiles.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPECTRE">SPECTRE</a>-like Stockholm Syndicate is
ruthlessly spreading terror among the European gov&shy;ern&shy;ments.
The shadowy Telescope or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tion, led by former cop Jules Beaurain,
is fighting it.</p>
<p>The plot is pre&shy;pos&shy;ter&shy;ous but engaging
in a classic Cold War thriller way.</p>

<p>Two months after our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/07/06/FranksMemorial.aspx">memorial</a> for Frank Maloney,
we took the ferry over to Vashon Island to scatter his ashes.
It was a beautiful September day, sunny but not too hot,
and a 20-minute ferry ride was most pleasant.</p>
<p>Kim and Holly fed us lunch at their place
and we all fell in love with their six rescue kittens.
We drove to a secluded beach
and each of us scattered a teaspoon of Frank's ashes upon the waters.
We sat there for a while and talked and wandered.
Then, back to Holly and Kim's for cake and coffee.</p>
<p>I know that Frank would have thoroughly enjoyed the day:

        </h1>
    </header>
    
<p>I've been running the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/06/20/WhenVideoCardsGoBad.aspx">64-bit version of Windows 7 RC</a> since June.
It's been quite painless on the whole.</p>
<p>One wrinkle that I ran into was with some batchfiles which
launch ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions in <tt class="docutils literal">%Pro&shy;gram&shy;Files%</tt> (normally <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\Program&nbsp;Files</span></tt>).
Due to the magic <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/craigmcmurtry/archive/2004/12/14/301155.aspx">WOW64 redirector</a>, 32-bit ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions
are actually installed into <tt class="docutils literal">%Pro&shy;gram&shy;Files(x86)%</tt>—normally <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\Program&nbsp;Files&nbsp;(x86)</span></tt>—instead of <tt class="docutils literal">%Pro&shy;gram&shy;Files%</tt>.
This is trans&shy;par&shy;ent to the 32-bit ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions,
which think they're running in <tt class="docutils literal">%Pro&shy;gram&shy;Files%</tt> (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\Program&nbsp;Files</span></tt>).</p>
<p>However, the cmd.exe shell is 64-bit
(unless you make a special effort to run the 32-bit cmd.exe in SysWOW64),
so batchfiles see the 64-bit <tt class="docutils literal">%Pro&shy;gram&shy;Files%</tt> which contains 64-bit ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions.</p>
<p>Hence, a batchfile that launches an installed 32-bit ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion on Win64
must use <tt class="docutils literal">%Pro&shy;gram&shy;Files(x86)%</tt>, not <tt class="docutils literal">%Pro&shy;gram&shy;Files%</tt>.</p>
<p>It sounds <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/09/12/Launching32bitApplicationsFromBatchfilesOnWin64.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I spent 90&nbsp;minutes phonebank&shy;ing for <a class="reference external" href="http://approve71.org/">Approve 71</a> after work today.
I called voters who had already been identified as leaning pro&shy;gres&shy;sive
and asked them to vote <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/08/31/APPROVEReferendum71.aspx">APPROVE on Referendum 71</a> in November.</p>
<p>Under the recent Domestic Part&shy;ner&shy;ship law
(SB&nbsp;5688 aka the “ev&shy;ery&shy;thing but marriage bill”),
registered domestic partners (same-sex couples
and opposite-sex couples with at least one partner over age 62),
and married couples, are now treated equally
under the law in all parts of Washington state.</p>
<p>The Religious Right objected and put together an initiative
which scraped together just enough signatures to be on the ballot.
They'll be voting to REJECT the bill,
which would overturn domestic part&shy;ner&shy;ships in this state.</p>

<p>Jack Irish is a one-time lawyer who makes a living doing odd job&shy;s—in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tions, racehorse hand&shy;i&shy;cap&shy;ping, cabinet making—in Melbourne.
A former client, who went to jail years ago while Jack had crawled into a bottle,
tries to reach Jack and promptly turns up dead.
Jack starts looking and what he finds isn't pretty:
corruption all the way up into the state government.</p>
<p>Jack isn't stupid, but he is naïve and out of his depth for much of the book.
Temple combines the Australian backdrop, social commentary,
a decent plot, and in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing characters to make <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/09/09/ReviewBadDebts.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Paying bills always makes me grumpy.
More than just the drain on my wallet,
it's also the sheer hassle and tedium.</p>
<p>I think it was last year that I finally switched over to using electronic billpay.
(I'm not always an early adopter.)
The hassle is less and I seldom write checks now.</p>
<p>I'd like to know why electronic payments take days, not mil&shy;lisec&shy;onds, to clear.
More predatory bank practices, no doubt.</p>
<p>I wrote several checks tonight.
For months I had been putting off renewing my membership
in various do-gooder or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tions like the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a>, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.glaad.org/">GLAAD</a>.

Actually, the weather was so wet this morning that we cooked and ate inside.</p>
<p>I am happy to report that thanks to the generosity of my sponsors,
I have raised $982 of my original goal of $1000.
With three weeks left until the walk,
I am predicting success in reaching my goal.</p>
