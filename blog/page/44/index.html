<p>I love Spring.
The winter recedes, the weather grows warmer,
the young plants appear, the dormant trees bloom,
and all is right with the world.</p>
<p>I dread Spring.
My nose itches, it runs, it blocks up, it explodes.</p>
<p>This year, my eyes itch too.
A lot.
It's really, um, irritating.</p>

<p>Our neigh&shy;bor&shy;hood was built in spurts.
The brick Tudors, like ours, were built in the 1930s.
The houses adjoining mine were built in the years after World War II.</p>
<p>There's a house for sale a few doors down that's very like ours.
We snooped around on Sunday during the open house.</p>
<p>Our house was built in 1931; the other, the year before.
Ours is slightly deeper, but the floor plans are very similar.

Our kitchen was remodeled in the sixties, taking over part of the next room.
Theirs never was and it's tiny.

    <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.betterthangrep.com/"></a>
<p>On a Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow question about <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21725/favorite-gvim-plugins-scripts">favorite Vim plugins</a>, I learned about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.betterthangrep.com/">Ack</a>,
a re&shy;place&shy;ment for grep that's smarter about searching source trees.</p>
<p>Ack is written in Perl.
The built-in <tt class="docutils literal">:vimgrep</tt> is rather slow.
It seems to have some Vim-specific overhead,
such as creating swap files and executing <tt class="docutils literal">BufRead</tt> autocmds.
Ack is noticeably faster,
though somewhat slower than GNU grep.</p>
<p>Which would you rather type to search a tree,
ignoring the <tt class="docutils literal">.svn</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">.git</tt> subtrees?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>ack -i -l foobar
<span class="nv">$ </span>grep --exclude<span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;*.svn*&#39;</span> --exclude<span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;*.git*&#39;</span> -i -l -r foobar .
</pre></div>
<p>The ack takes 6 seconds to search 4500 files, while the grep completes in 2.
This does not count the time that I spent trying <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/25/AckBetterThanGrep.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>When we bought our house in 2000,
our interest rate was about 8.5% on a 30-year loan.
A couple of years later, we refinanced it down to 6.875%,
which reduced our monthly payments by several hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Today, we signed the paperwork to refinance it again,
down to 4.75% over 20 years.
That drops our monthly payment by another $300,
which is most welcome, as Emma's unemployed.</p>
<p>All of these are fixed-rate mortgages.
We're really not fans of adjustable-rate mortgages:
too many horror stories about people starting out a low rate
and not being able to cope when the rates go up.</p>

<p>I grew up hating rugby.
I spent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2006/02/19/OlympicsRazorthinMargins.aspx">eleven years</a> at a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's_College,_Dublin">rugger-bugger school</a> in Dublin.
I couldn't stand the game.
I was a small, unathletic child with no interest in sports.
Rugby, even the modified rugby that they teach seven-year-olds,
was violent and unpleasant and involved running around cold, wet fields.
I had a big operation on my feet when I was 10
and I parlayed that into an excuse never to play rugby again.</p>
<p>I can't remember when I last watched a rugby match,
but it was surely back in the '80s,
as I doubt I've seen one over the 20 years that I've been in the States.</p>

<p>Python has <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions">list com&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sions</a>,
syntactic sugar for building lists from an expression.</p>

<pre class="brush: python">
>>> [2 * i for i in (2, 3, 5, 7, 11)]
[4, 6, 10, 14, 22]
</pre>

<p>This doesn't work so well when the com&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sion expression
is itself a list: you end up with a list of lists.</p>

<pre class="brush: python">
>>> def gen():
...     for l in [['a', 'b'], ['c'], ['d', 'e', 'f']]:
...         yield l
...
>>> [l for l in gen()]
[['a', 'b'], ['c'], ['d', 'e', 'f']]
</pre>

<p>This is ugly. Here's one way to build a flattened list,
but it's less elegant than the com&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sion.</p>

<p>DI John Rebus in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gates the murder of an illegal immigrant,
who had ties to asylum seekers in Edinburgh.
DS Siobhan Clarke looks into the dis&shy;ap&shy;pear&shy;ance of a teenaged girl;
soon, the rapist of the girl's sister is murdered.</p>
<p>Rebus and Siobhan struggle with the uglier side of life in Edinburgh,
notably, racism, latter-day slavery, and the increasing numbers of asylum seekers.
As usual, their personal lives are in a mess:
Rebus drinks too much;
Siobhan falls asleep with a tub of ice cream.</p>
<p>As in other <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/12/24/ReviewResurrectionMen.aspx">Rebus books</a>, the two in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tions end up

<p>We discovered <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bistrotbistro.com/">Bistrot Bistro</a> in Kitsilano on a previous visit to Vancouver.
It's an agreeable little French restaurant just south of downtown.
Emma suggested that we eat there again for my birthday,
and it was a fine choice.</p>
<p>We ate from the <em>prix fixe</em> menu for $26 apiece.
She had the carrot soup, roast chicken, and raspberry sorbet;
I had the <em>pate de campagne</em>, a peppercorn steak, and a chocolate mousse.
The <em>prix fixe</em> included a sizeable quantity of <em>pommes frites</em>.
We added Brussel sprouts, a baguette with olive tapenade,
and a half-litre of Pinot Gris,
and walked away two hours later, pleasantly sated.</p>

<p>We drove up to Vancouver today.
We'll be here until Tuesday.
It's my birthday tomorrow and
I have two days of vacation that I have to use by the end of March or lose them,
so why not.</p>
<p>I always like Vancouver.
It's un&shy;equiv&shy;o&shy;cal&shy;ly a major city.
Vancouver feels more urban than Seattle,
where people have only been moving into high-density
downtown condos and apartments for a few years.</p>
<p>We're staying at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sunsetinn.com/">Sunset Inn and Suites</a> in the West End.
We stayed here before.
It's relatively cheap, clean, and centrally located.
No particular charm either.</p>
