<p>For decades, Detroit has fought a rearguard action against
change—seat&shy;belts, CAFE standards for increased fuel efficiency,
met&shy;ri&shy;ca&shy;tion, renewable energy, building gas guzzling SUVs
instead of hybrids, all come to mind.</p>
<p>Change is needed.
The current management must go.
The big three must build vehicles that make sense.</p>
<p>It's not often that I agree with Mitt Romney,
but his op-ed piece, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html">Let Detroit Go Bankrupt</a>,
in Wednes&shy;day's NYT lands in the vicinity of the mark.</p>
<p>He ignores one big reason for the higher costs of American cars,
the cost of company-funded healthcare.</p>
<p>But another article in the same day's paper,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/business/economy/19bankruptcy.html">Advantage of Corporate Bankruptcy Is Dwindling</a>,
points out:</p>

<p>My formerly trusty Casio Exilim EX-Z1000 camera went berserk one night in September.
The zoom lens wedged open and nothing I did would persuade it to retract
into the case or take more photos.
The zoom had grown a little tem&shy;per&shy;me&shy;n&shy;tal in the preceding month,
but I didn't expect cat&shy;a&shy;stroph&shy;ic failure.</p>
<p>The other hardware failure was far more upsetting.</p>
<p>From Christmas until August, I ripped most of our CD collection
with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/">Exact Audio Copy</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Lossless_Audio_Codec">FLAC</a> (Free Lossless Audio Codec).
Since FLAC is lossless and open source,
I figured I'd never need to rip the CDs again.
I also wrote a Python script to convert the FLACs to MP3s with <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/11/18/HardwareLazarus.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I'm delighted!
Today, the American people made an excellent decision
and chose the right man for the job.</p>
<p>Obama fought a long, hard campaign,
rising from underdog to an assured victory.
He ran an exemplary, innovative campaign,
that empowered millions of grassroots activists.
He shattered barriers and inspired voters.</p>
<p>He won by a huge margin in the Electoral College,
giving himself un&shy;equiv&shy;o&shy;cal legitimacy.
He'll need it.
The country has deep problems and it's not going to be an easy presidency.</p>
<p>Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, I look forward to the next four years.</p>

<p>I'm voting for Obama, which is no secret to anyone who knows me.
I agree with his policies and I'm impressed by the man.
Over the last two years, he's run an excellent campaign,
going from underdog to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2008/10/25/obamas_lead/">all-but certain victory</a>.
Clearly, he has executive ability.</p>
<p>Moreover, McCain is the wrong man for the job.
I strongly disagree with his policies (es&shy;sen&shy;tial&shy;ly Bush's),
his campaign is thrashing spas&shy;ti&shy;cal&shy;ly,
and he dis&shy;qual&shy;i&shy;fied himself by picking that blithering idiot Palin as his VP.</p>
<p>I'm more worried about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chrisgregoire.com/">Christine Gregoire</a>,
who is running for re-election as Governor of Washington.
She's un&shy;com&shy;fort&shy;ably close in the polls to Dino Rossi.

The book in&shy;ter&shy;weaves two novels, <em>Bonanza</em> and <em>The Juncto</em>,
taking place between 1689 and 1702.
<em>Bonanza</em> follows Jack Shaftoe,
as he and other galley slaves in Algiers
capture Spanish gold of particular sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cance to some highly placed alchemists,
and make their way ever eastward,
through Cairo, India, Manila, and Mexico.
<em>The Juncto</em> deals primarily with Eliza,
now a French duchess,
and her remarkable financial derring-do.</p>

<p>After months of attacking Obama's “in&shy;ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence”,
McCain has picked an unknown first-term governor from a minor state
with an un&shy;der&shy;whelm&shy;ing resume.</p>
<p>What gross ir&shy;re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty!
A seventy-two-year-old with a history of skin cancer,
who feels the need to keep his medical records under a tight wrap,
should have a running mate who's ready to
take over at any time.
When you compare her to Biden or Obama,
Palin clearly isn't.
I sincerely believe that I'm better informed about the world than she is,
based on reports of her lack of interest in Iraq until recently,
and that she didn't have a passport until 2007.</p>
