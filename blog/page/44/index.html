<p>Aaron Swartz has a moderately in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing piece
on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity">pro&shy;duc&shy;tiv&shy;i&shy;ty and pro&shy;cras&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion</a>.</p>
<p>We all pro&shy;cras&shy;ti&shy;nate.
I certainly pro&shy;cras&shy;ti&shy;nate.</p>
<p>Sometimes my pro&shy;cras&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion is tantamount to
making sure that my pencils are very, very sharp.
More often, I find myself surfing the web,
free as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;at&shy;ing off in random directions.
There's no end to the fas&shy;ci&shy;nat&shy;ing dis&shy;trac&shy;tions.</p>
<p>In lesser cases, I pro&shy;cras&shy;ti&shy;nate because I'm bored
or not fully engaged in what I'm doing.</p>
<p>When I have a more severe case,
I think fear is the root cause.
I don't really know how to proceed,
I don't really understand what it is that I'm supposed to be doing,
and I don't really want to come to grips with it.

As you can see from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21271969@N06/">Emma's Flickr page</a>,
she's knit a lot of beautiful pieces.</p>
<p>I'm hoping she will revive her <a class="reference external" href="http://www.emmabart.com/Meanderings/">dormant blog</a>

She does have some writeups at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ravelry.com/">Ravelry</a> (Facebook for knitters)

<p>Clint Eastwood directs himself as Walt Kowalski,
a retired auto worker.
Newly widowed, estranged from his sons,
and haunted by his Korean War ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ences,
Walt is a bitter, racist old bastard.</p>
<p>He doesn't like the Hmong immigrants who live next door
and he nearly shoots the teenage boy, Thao,
when he catches Thao trying to steal his beloved 1972 Gran Torino.
The theft was to be the reluctant Thao's gang initiation.
The gang come by to punish Thao and Walt runs the “gooks” off his lawn at gunpoint.
The Hmong neighbors start bringing over food and flowers in gratitude.
Walt is confounded and wants to <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/02/14/ReviewGranTorino.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>For a long time, I disliked Facebook.
It seemed to consist entirely of annoying ac&shy;quain&shy;tances
attacking me with vampires or sending me pointless “gifts”.</p>
<p>I've used Facebook more in the last month
and it's been less annoying than I remembered it.
I check it once or twice a day and see updates
from people I know.
More en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing than ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ing.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/georgevreilly">Twitter</a>, though, has not clicked for me.
Brevity is good, but Twitter is too minimalist.
Stream-of-con&shy;scious&shy;ness ejac&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tions.
Opaque URLs disdaining ex&shy;pla&shy;na&shy;tion.
Feh.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToTwitterFirstStepsAndATwitterGlossary.aspx">Scott Hanselman</a> has a different take on Twitter.</p>
<p>Maybe I need to “follow” a better class of people.</p>

Best read in sequence.</p>

An unknown enemy is summoning a demon every night to kill her.
She learns some surprising things about her past

<p>Previous books were heavy on the action;
here it kicks in very late and the book is very talky.</p>
<p>Moderately en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing but weaker than earlier books in the series.</p>

<em>Paul of Dune</em> is an interquel,
largely taking place in the decade
between the events of <em>Dune</em> and of <em>Dune Messiah</em>.</p>
<p>Paul Atreides has become the Emperor of the known galaxy.
A vicious jihad has burst across the empire in his name.
His prescience tells him that it's absolutely necessary
so that mankind can break out of the course that leads to stagnation and de&shy;struc&shy;tion.
But billions have died and many more are yet to die.
He is feared and hated.

<p>I made <a class="reference external" href="http://www.joyofbaking.com/RoyalIcing.html">royal icing</a> last night for the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2007/01/05/ChristmasCake.aspx">Christmas Cake</a> to put over
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2007/01/05/ChristmasCake.aspx">marzipan</a>.
A very tedious half hour with an electric handheld mixer
to beat the egg whites until they were stiff, and then beat in the powdered sugar.</p>
<p>The recipe that I used from an old Joy of Cooking called for the juice of 1 lemon.
I used ReaLemon which says that 3 ta&shy;ble&shy;spoons = 1 lemon.
I added two ta&shy;ble&shy;spoons, which was quite lemony.
The recipe that I've linked to calls for two teaspoons, which seems like a better choice.</p>
<p>I had drizzled whiskey over the cake several times to keep it moist.
That was a <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/01/26/ChristmasCake.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I made my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2007/01/05/ChristmasCake.aspx">Christmas Cake</a> back in November,
but am only now getting around to putting on the icing.
I've kept it moist with several ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions of whiskey.</p>
<p>Last year, I made <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzipan">marzipan</a> from scratch.
Never again!
It was a huge amount of work to blanch the almonds
and the stiff mixture of sugar and almonds caused the
food processor to seize up more than once.</p>
<p>I didn't use up all the marzipan that I made that time.
I put the remainder into a sealed container,
placed it in the fridge, and forgot all about it.
When I took it out of the fridge yesterday,
it was still good.

<p>I seldom get bad colds, but I caught one on the plane back from Ireland,
and it's left me drained of energy for the last ten days.
Jet lag and Frank's death surely con&shy;tributed too.
Feh!</p>
<p>Maybe I'll be up to cycling into work tomorrow.
Between the snow, being in Ireland for two weeks, and this cold,
it's been almost a month since I last rode in.</p>
