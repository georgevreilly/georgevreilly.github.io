    <p>I needed to import some plugin code written in Python
from a directory whose path isn&#8217;t known until runtime.
Further, I needed a class object that was a subclass of the plugin base&nbsp;class.</p>

<pre class="brush: python">

<p>You can use the <a class="reference external" href="https://pymotw.com/2/imp/">imp</a> module to actually load the module from <tt class="docutils literal">impl_dir</tt>.
Note that <tt class="docutils literal">impl_dir</tt> needs to be tem&shy;porar&shy;i&shy;ly prepended to <tt class="docutils literal">sys.path</tt>.

    <p>It&#8217;s better to stay calm when things aren&#8217;t going well.
Stress and panic are contagious.
When you&#8217;re broad&shy;cast&shy;ing stress or panic on all channels,
other people start picking it up.
If you can keep your cool, others are more likely to remain calm too.
Often that&#8217;s for the best,
but sometimes it backfires
because others in&shy;cor&shy;rect&shy;ly believe that everything is still&nbsp;okay.</p>
<p>Knowing when to ask for help is an art.
You learn a lot when you persevere and try different things,
many of which may fail.
The failures will likely show you where your un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing is deficient;
you learn some of the many ways in which things can go wrong.

    <p>I <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/02/01/ToastmastersContestChair.html">mentioned</a> a few weeks ago that I was going to be the Contest Chair
for the In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al Speech and Evaluation Contests
at <a class="reference external" href="http://freelyspeaking.org/">Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters</a>.
Those contests were tonight,
and I was both Contest Chair and Toast&shy;mas&shy;ter.
The contest chair sets up everything be&shy;fore&shy;hand;
the toast&shy;mas&shy;ter runs the contest itself;
frequently but not nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;i&shy;ly the contest chair is also the&nbsp;toast&shy;mas&shy;ter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy with how it came off.
I managed to recruit two speakers for the Speech contest
and three evaluators for the Evaluation contest,
all of whom acquitted themselves well.
I also recruited three judges, two ballot counters, one timer,
a sergeant at arms, and a test speaker
to make the contest run.

<p>I came across this cartoon today;
it reminded me that I&#8217;ve been meaning to write
about the hit-or-miss nature of adapting books for the&nbsp;screen.</p>
<p>Books and video/film are different media,
with different con&shy;ven&shy;tions and needs.
Often the most-loved elements of a book are lost
when it&#8217;s adapted for television or film,
upsetting&nbsp;fans.</p>
<p>As <span class="caps">J.K.</span> Rowling wrote about one of the Harry Potter&nbsp;movies:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;It is simply impossible to in&shy;cor&shy;po&shy;rate every one of my storylines
into a film that has to be kept under four hours long.
Obviously films have re&shy;stric&shy;tions
– novels do not have con&shy;straints of time and budget;
I can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but
the in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tion of my own and <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/02/28/AdaptingBooksForFilmAndTV.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></blockquote>

<p>From a cryp&shy;to&shy;graph&shy;ic standpoint, <span class="caps">PGP</span> is rock solid.
In practice, using it is very messy.
Its complexity has deterred the vast majority of people

<p>The first problem is es&shy;tab&shy;lish&shy;ing a valid identity,

The second is dis&shy;trib&shy;ut&shy;ing public keys
without nefarious types posting al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tive keys

I didn&#8217;t have high hopes for it and it was better than I expected.
Dennis left a pregnant Libby (Thandie Newton) at the altar five years ago.
Now he&#8217;s an overweight security guard in a London lingerie shop
and she&#8217;s found a new boyfriend who&#8217;s everything that Dennis is not:
Whit (Hank Azaria) is well off, handsome, and very fit.
Somehow Dennis ends up promising to run in a marathon in three weeks&#8217; time
that Whit is also running in.
Much of the story revolves around his training,
his desperate attempts to win over Libby,

<p>The Coen Brothers&#8217; latest movie, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail,_Caesar!">Hail, Caesar!</a>, is a lot of fun.
I&#8217;ve been looking forward to it since the trailers showed up a few months ago.
It&#8217;s a homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood,
an age where quirky talents like the Coens
could not have made Coen Brothers&#8217; movies.
We see song and dance numbers, syn&shy;chro&shy;nized swimming,
singing cowboys, and ballroom dramas.
Most of all, we see a big-budget swords-and-sandals epic,
whose star, Baird Whitlock, has been kidnapped by The Future,
a group of Communist screen&shy;writ&shy;ers,
and is being held for $100,000 ransom.
Eddie Mannix is the studio fixer who has to wrangle

<p>Both Trump and Cruz scare me, for very different reasons.
Trump is impulsive, all id, doesn&#8217;t give a fuck,
riling up the worst impulses of the American electorate for short-term gain.

At that point, Rome&#8217;s population was somewhere between one and two million people,
the largest city in Europe until 19th century London.
Con&shy;stan&shy;tine was Emperor and a few years later,
he would move his capital to Con&shy;stan&shy;tino&shy;ple.
A century and a half later, the final emperors would&nbsp;die.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only visited Rome once, when I was ten years old.
