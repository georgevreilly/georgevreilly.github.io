<p>My most recent trip to Montréal was a year ago this week for PyCon 2015,
following another trip there two years ago this week for PyCon&nbsp;2014.</p>
<p>My first trip to Montréal was a very long business trip in 1995.
Four colleagues and I spent five or six weeks in Montréal,
just before the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_referendum,_1995">Quebec in&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dence referendum</a>,
working onsite for our client,
in&shy;te&shy;grat&shy;ing the <span class="caps">UI</span> we had written into the rest of their&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>We had to bring our own computers, as they declined to provide us with any equipment.
In 1995, this meant shipping our desktop systems <em>and</em> our heavy <span class="caps">CRT</span> monitors.
Through Canadian Customs.
And back through <span class="caps">US</span> Customs when <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/04/04/LuggingCRTMonitorsToMontreal.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>I needed to track down a remote branch created a couple of months ago
on another machine.
I knew which file had been changed,
but none of the far-too-many remote branches&#8217; names rang a&nbsp;bell.</p>
<p>Turns out that using <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6258440/find-a-git-branch-containing-changes-to-a-given-file">git branch &#8211;contains</a> in the right way finds all the relevant&nbsp;branches.</p>

<p>The first line, <tt class="docutils literal">git log <span class="pre">--all</span> <span class="pre">--format=%H</span> <span class="caps">FILENAME</span></tt>,
lists all the <em>hashes</em> for commits that contained changes to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="caps">FILENAME</span></tt>.
The second finds all the branches that contain those hashes
(I added <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--remotes</span></tt>).

<p>Jacqi Garza was abducted when she was eight.
She got away but her life has gone far off course in decade since.
Now she&#8217;s the prime witness to a murder.
Phelan Tierney, a former lawyer, has taken her under his wing,
but she&#8217;s not easy to&nbsp;help.</p>
<p>This is dark and disturbing, if ultimately hopeful.
It&#8217;s a portrait of a town in distress
and of some of its citizens.
Some are still trying to make a difference,
while others are too lost in their own pain and <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/04/02/ReviewTheMercyOfTheNight.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I moved to Seattle in 1992 and spent the next 13 years commuting to the Eastside,
largely across the <span class="caps">SR</span>-520 Floating Bridge.
Ten of those years were at Microsoft; the rest, elsewhere in Redmond and Bothell.
It was im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly obvious that 520 needed more capacity.
Only now, 24 years later, are we getting that extra capacity:
a new bridge that will replace the old, worn-out&nbsp;bridge.</p>
<p>The old bridge has only two lanes in either direction and there&#8217;s no shoulder.
If anything happens, like a flat tire or a stalled car,
one lane im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly grinds to a halt.
The second lane promptly jams up as everyone merges into it.

    <p>Ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ing would make you think that acne is a problem only for teenagers.
Not true.
It&#8217;s never entirely gone away for me.
I often find spots on my nose.
Less often, on my chin or forehead.
I&#8217;ve even had a few spots inside my&nbsp;ears.</p>
<p>For some reason, I woke up with three spots this morning:
on the side of my nose;
under my jawline, hidden by my beard;
and on the back of my neck, near the hairline.
Go&nbsp;figure.</p>

a 13&quot; Retina with <span class="caps">16GB</span> <span class="caps">RAM</span> and <span class="caps">500GB</span> <span class="caps">SSD</span>,

<span class="caps">8GB</span> wasn&#8217;t really enough for software de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment.
By the time you run Chrome and PyCharm and Docker,
you don&#8217;t have much <span class="caps">RAM</span> left.

<p>The drug smugglers who bring their mer&shy;chan&shy;dise in through the Florida Keys
need some local expertise and decide that Breeze Albury is their man.
Although he has no desire to be involved,
they force him to take part.
When they need a convenient fall guy and set him up,
he turns on The Machine and on the corrupt local cops.
Revenge is&nbsp;sweet.</p>

<p>Jane Nichols&#8217; parents were murdered in front of her on a Greek hillside

An <span class="caps">MI5</span> operation triggers some dormant memories

She returns to her life in Savannah to lay a&nbsp;trap.</p>
<p>Another en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing entry in the Jane series.
The last, presumably, since it&#8217;s nearly 20 years&nbsp;old.</p>

In Chapter 1 (Telemachus), Stephen Dedalus arises in the Martello Tower at Sandymount

<p>The Washington state Democratic Caucus was held today.
The final totals aren&#8217;t in yet but Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton
by a nearly 3:1 margin around the state.
Our own precinct, <span class="caps">SEA</span> 11-1945, had Sanders 41, Clinton 26, Undecided 2.
That translates to 4 Sanders delegates and 2 Clinton delegates
in the next level of&nbsp;caucusing.</p>
<p>Emma and I both voted for Sanders.
We believe that Sanders represents much-needed change
in the party and in the nation.
Clinton is un&shy;doubt&shy;ed&shy;ly one of the most qualified candidates ever,
with an ex&shy;tra&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nary résumé and a high degree of competence.
She&#8217;s also too tied to the status quo for my&nbsp;liking.</p>
