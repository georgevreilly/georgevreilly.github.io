<p>Normally, we have Shuttle Express take us to Sea-Tac airport,
but they were completely booked up when I tried to make a reser&shy;va&shy;tion
earlier in the week.
Lyndol very kindly came over at 6am and drove us down to the airport.</p>
<p>Our plane left an hour late from Seattle,
as it came in late the night before
and the crew had to wait for the statutory FTC minimum stopover.
The late departure from Seatac was no problem,
since we had a scheduled 5-hour layover in Philadelpia.
After being shoehorned into the plane,
we needed to stretch and wandered through several of the terminals.
The only excitement was when I realized an <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/21/InDublin.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>My friends Frank and Lyndol met 32 years ago today,
the day they celebrate as their an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
For several years, Emma and I have brought them out for dinner on this date.
We also celebrate Lyn's birthday,
which falls next week.</p>
<p>Frank's health has been poor for some years,
but it's grown worse this year.
He spent six weeks in hospital in September and October.
He's home now, but he's in <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.motss/browse_thread/thread/38e9223106252317">hospice care</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, we try to see him often,
since he rarely feels strong enough to leave the house,
even in a wheelchair.
We almost always find him in good form,
glad to see us and ready with his stories.</p>
<p>He's somewhat stronger <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/17/ToFrankAndLyndol.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Jeremy Wheale is ‘a grey little man in a grey little job’
who doesn't fit in well in swinging London.
His brother is murdered and he finds himself embroiled
in the search for a lost Mayan city in the Yucutan peninsula.
His companions are a rich old ar&shy;chae&shy;ol&shy;o&shy;gist,
a paranoid young ar&shy;chae&shy;ol&shy;o&shy;gist, and his attractive wife.
Somewhere out in the jungle is a Mafia don
who's convinced that there's a hoard of gold in Uaxuanoc.</p>

<p>It snowed in Seattle yesterday.
We drove over to Sammamish last night to my CEO's house
for the Holiday Party.
The snow wasn't sticking to the roads,
so although visibility wasn't great,
getting there and back was not difficult.</p>
<p>It was cold today and colder tonight.
I saw only a light dusting of snow fall today,
but the snow that was melting earlier has refrozen.</p>
<p>We had to go out this evening,
over to Burien to see Frank.
The main roads were fine,
but we had a slightly alarming descent
on a hill near us as we headed over there.
Coming home, we had a couple of unpleasant minutes
trying to get up a hill <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/15/IcyRoads.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Lots of new babies around.</p>
<p>Dilip in North Carolina emailed me the other day
and mentioned the recent birth of his daughter, Anuragini.
And Alan in Dublin emailed me this morning,
to tell me of the birth of his daughter, Beth.</p>
<p>My sister, Michelle Bowles, is due to give birth on the 19th
to the first Reilly grandchild.
We arrive in Dublin on the 21st.
First babies tend to be born late,
so we may get there before the baby does.
She and David have elected not to learn the gender of the baby,
so I addressed their Christmas card to &quot;Michelle, David, and TBD&quot;.</p>

<p>We've gone high-def over the last month.
First, Emma bought a <a class="reference external" href="http://www2.panasonic.com/consumer-electronics/support/Televisions/VIERA-Plasma-HDTVs/model.TH-42PZ80U.S">42&quot; 1080p plasma Panasonic HDTV</a>
to replace the 32&quot; CRT TV in our living room.
Although it's wider, it's not over&shy;whelm&shy;ing,
as the slender box sits further back.
The picture's pretty good—at least when you give it a good signal.</p>
<p>To take advantage of it required a cascade of upgrades.
Our old TiVo served us well for eight years;
ap&shy;point&shy;ment TV has long been alien to us.
It's dis&shy;con&shy;nect&shy;ed now, replaced the other day
by a DirecTV Plus DVR and a new satellite dish.
I had heard bad things about the older DirecTV DVRs,
but I have no complaints about this <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/10/HDTV.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

I said that it was the first in a series of daily posts for <a class="reference external" href="http://nablopomo.ning.com/">NaBloPoMo</a>,
the National Blog Posting Month, which I had just found out about.</p>
<p>Here I am a month later, having posted something every single evening.
I covered humor; movie and book reviews; being the #1 tech blog (now #2);
politics; Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing; food; personal stuff; and even some technical posts.
Whew!</p>
<p>Why bother? As with the two-year-old exercise in book reviews,
it was a personal challenge to come up with a post every single evening

in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gates the death of a beautiful ghost

He has the gift (or curse) of psy&shy;chom&shy;e&shy;try:
when he touches something,
he can divine its history.</p>
<p>This book wobbles between not very black comedy
and straight urban fantasy,
and doesn't really succeed as either.</p>

<p>I look out the window.
Driz&shy;zling—not too heavy—I'll ride to work.
Pack my clothes into the panier bag.
Spandex tights, coat, yellow jacket, helmet, gloves: on they go.
Bike's in the garage, seems okay, slap on the bag.
Pull it out, reset the odometer.
17 minutes today?</p>
<p>Ignite the blinky lights, pull away.
Down the side roads, until I'm compelled to take the arterial.
Press the crosswalk button, wait for a break in the traffic.
Two minutes, three, does this fucking light <em>ever</em> change?
Off like a shot, past Jefferson Park.
Maybe they'll finish by next summer.
Hit the next light at 2:30.
A long, gentle uphill for the next 8 minutes.
