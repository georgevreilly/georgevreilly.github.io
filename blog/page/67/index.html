<p>As I mentioned the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/04/06/CirceSecondDraft.html">other night</a>,
I introduced two narrators into the chapter of Ulysses
that we&#8217;re reading in&nbsp;June.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say from the rehearsal tonight that the additions are successful,
that they clarify the text for the listener,
without being intrusive.
I expect that I&#8217;ll have to produce a third draft of the script in a few weeks,
but I think the next round of changes will be minor.
The second draft required hundreds of small&nbsp;changes.</p>
<p>We gained three new readers tonight.
There are plenty of parts to go around, so it&#8217;s all to the good.
We had great difficulty initially last year in
getting enough readers from the old guard,

<p>In Seattle, it is said that moss grows on the north side of the rain.
To be sure, moss thrives in the shadier parts of our&nbsp;yard.</p>
<p>On a cold, dry February day,
I rented a pressure washer with the intention
of scouring the moss from the ground
and the flaking paint from the garage walls.
Although it was quite effective at removing moss,
it made a godawful mess.
There were muddy flecks of moss everywhere.
Against the flaking paint, it made little impression
and I still have to deal with that.
I had dealt with perhaps a third of the moss
when the pressure washer died.
I got a partial refund, but didn&#8217;t <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/04/06/RemovingMoss.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Moments ago, I completed the second draft of the Circe Part I script
for this year&#8217;s Ulysses&nbsp;reading.</p>
<p>The chapter is couched in the form of a play,
making it relatively straight&shy;for&shy;ward to convert to a staged reading.
There are, however, huge numbers of “stage di&shy;rec&shy;tion&shy;s”,
often ironic, generally unactable:
A vast, detailed procession in Bloom&#8217;s honor;
Bloom burning at the stake;
camels offering mangoes to Molly;
and much, much&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>In addition, there are over one hundred characters,
most of whom have a line or two, then disappear.
They need to be introduced&nbsp;somehow.</p>
<p>So I added two narrators to handle all of this.
They steer the reading along,
adding much-needed context to aid the audience

<p>It&#8217;s been a long, dreary winter in Seattle.
After a horrible, wet Saturday,
last Sunday was glorious, the first nice day in weeks.
Then the cold and rain came back.
It snowed on April 1st, for Pete&#8217;s&nbsp;sake.</p>
<p>And now we have another lovely weekend,
with promised highs in the high Sixties tomorrow.
I did some yard work today
and cleaned the grill and outdoor furniture.
We&#8217;ve invited a handful of friends over for dinner tomorrow&nbsp;night.</p>

<p>I am greatly heartened by today&#8217;s news of Iowa&#8217;s Supreme Court
unan&shy;i&shy;mous&shy;ly striking down the state&#8217;s gay marriage ban.
The passage of <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2008/11/16/AgainstGayMarriageDontHaveOne.html">Propo&shy;si&shy;tion 8</a> in California was a setback.
The Iowa Court made a strong <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pamshouseblend.com/diary/10226/iowa-court-eviscerates-rightwing-talking-points">ruling</a>,
gutting the arguments against same-sex&nbsp;marriage.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe now that in&shy;ter&shy;ra&shy;cial marriage was illegal
in many states until 1967.
President Obama&#8217;s parents could not have married in those states.
We look back at that now with bemusement and a little horror.
The opposition, then as now, was led by cultural con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tives,
making <a class="reference external" href="http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2004_fall/forde.htm">religious arguments</a>.</p>
<p>Someday soon, we&#8217;ll look back at the gay marriage debate
with the same bemusement and wonder what all the fuss was&nbsp;about.</p>

<p>About three weeks ago, I answered a question on Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow
about generating the <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/646068/find-most-readable-colour-of-text-that-is-drawn-on-a-coloured-surface/646328#646328">most readable color</a> of text
on a colored&nbsp;background.</p>
<p>I suggested flipping the top bit of each component,
<tt class="docutils literal">(r ^ 0x80, g ^ 0x80, b ^ 0x80)</tt>.
This has the same effect as adding 128 if the component is less than 128,
and sub&shy;tract&shy;ing 128&nbsp;otherwise.</p>
<p>Another way to think about it is to imagine the 256x256x256 color cube.
Inside that cube, erect another cube half as wide.
One corner is at your original color
and the diagonally opposite corner is the one computed&nbsp;above.</p>
<p>The questioner liked my answer the best,
but I decided to experiment further.

<p>I love Spring.
The winter recedes, the weather grows warmer,
the young plants appear, the dormant trees bloom,
and all is right with the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>I dread Spring.
My nose itches, it runs, it blocks up, it&nbsp;explodes.</p>
<p>This year, my eyes itch too.
A lot.
It&#8217;s really, um,&nbsp;irritating.</p>

Ours is slightly deeper, but the floor plans are very similar.
Theirs has no eye&shy;catch&shy;ing yellow brick trim.
Our kitchen was remodeled in the sixties, taking over part of the next room.

Sixty years ago, the British Crown gathered together the Murray Group,

The remnants of the group fled England in World War <span class="caps">II</span>.
