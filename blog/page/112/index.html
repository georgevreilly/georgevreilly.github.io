    <p>My brother David sent me this photo earlier today, of
me, him, and Michelle. I&#8217;m guessing that Michelle is less than a year old,
so it was taken sometime in 1971, which would make David four and me six.
(Our youngest brother, Mark, wasn&#8217;t born until&nbsp;1973.)</p>

<p>Emma thinks we&#8217;re adorable and has already made this picture her desktop
background on her work&nbsp;computer.</p>
<p>Mark has another photo of the four of us, taken in 1978
on his website, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.alienresident.net/">alien&shy;res&shy;i&shy;dent.net</a>:</p>

things future ages may dismiss with a snort — just as we look with
in&shy;creduli&shy;ty at our forebears’ faith in the theory of the four bodily
humours or possession by demons. Here is another modern candidate: the
idea that there is a set of males called ho&shy;mo&shy;sex&shy;u&shy;als, and another

<p>Joe Lieberman, the 2000 vice-pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial nominee, lost the Democratic primary
for his Senate seat tonight. He has said that he will run as an in&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dent.
In effect, he will not accept the will of the&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Lieberman lost, in part, because of his continuing refusal to admit that
the Iraq war is a disaster, and in part because he has been a leading
enabler of the Republican agenda. Good&nbsp;riddance!</p>

<p>Well, fuck! The Washington State Supreme Court handed down its long-awaited decision
today on the con&shy;sti&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ty of the state&#8217;s Defense of Marriage Act.
Somehow, they found that it didn&#8217;t violate the state con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&#8217;s Equal
Protection&nbsp;clause.</p>
<p>No same-sex marriages in Washington state anytime&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>I attended the <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/279042_samesex27.html">rally at the First Baptist church</a>

Some anger, some dis&shy;ap&shy;point&shy;ment. Mostly upbeat.
The young Latina couple were very affecting.
The Serkin-Pooles invited everyone to join their club,
as they announced their formal engagement to each other.
One speaker pointed out that even if the court had handed down a favorable
decision, the process would not have been&nbsp;over.</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t really planned to visit Ireland this year, but then my sister
Michelle phoned the other day to say that her boyfriend, David Bowles, had
just proposed to her. Not a big surprise. They had moved in together
earlier this year, and we were all assuming that it was a question of when,
not&nbsp;if.</p>
<p>They plan to get married quite soon, as his father has been given
six-to-nine months to live, and they want him to be at the wedding. I don&#8217;t
know if the date is firm yet, but the latest that I&#8217;m hearing is&nbsp;November-11th.</p>

Only their respective bosses, Su&shy;per&shy;in&shy;ten&shy;dant Wong and Big Sam, know who they are.
Each becomes aware of the other about the same time,

<p>It&#8217;s a tense and complex thriller and a meditation on good and evil.
