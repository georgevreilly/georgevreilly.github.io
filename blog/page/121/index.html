Roy and his other family members in the Seattle area

    <p>I learned a really clever trick at our <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/09/14/KatrinaEvacueesWorkPartiesAndScalingBack.html">workparty</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p>We were using a dolly that we had borrowed from our neighbor Mary
to haul a heavy credenza up from the basement.
One of the tires was flat, which made the exercise even more difficult.</p>
<p>I got out my bicycle floor pump and started pumping,
but it was a waste of time.
The tire was tubeless and without any air,
so it just slipped loosely around the rim.
After a few minutes of futility,
Dale remembered something he had seen years before at a gas station.</p>
<p>He got a bowl of soapy water and a sponge,
and coated the metal rim and both <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/14/SoapingUpAFlatTire.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>I <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/08/26/AIDSWalk2005.html">mentioned recently</a> that I would be walking in this year’s <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Walk.
And so I did.</p>
<p>After months of dry, sunny weather in Seattle, I have grown un­ac­cus­tomed to rain.
It was an unpleasant morning and an unpleasant shock.
The skies opened and I stood in an endless line waiting to register.
I raised $1180, which entitled me to huddle in the <span class="caps">VIP</span> tent, as the rain continued.
The rain finally let up about halfway along the route, as we debouched onto Broadway.</p>
<p>Thanks to my fellow Team BiNet Seattle fundrais­ers, Emily and Meghan,
who raised a few hundred more between them.
Double thanks to Emily for giving me a <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/14/AIDSWalkRainHappens.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>My good friend Frank Maloney turned 60 the other day.
A few months ago, he invited Emma and me to join him
and his partner, Lyndol,
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theherbfarm.com">The Herbfarm</a>.
The Herbfarm is one of the very best restau­rants in the Seattle area.
Certainly one of the most expensive.</p>

<p>Frank brought us to The Herbfarm, but not at his own expense.
One of Frank’s college roommates was Ron Zimmerman,
the owner of The Herbfarm,
and Ron had invited Frank to bring Lyndol and two guests
over for his 60th birthday.
Ron semi-seriously credits Frank with in­tro­duc­ing him to good wine,
when Frank was a sommelier in the Seventies.</p>

<p>We had a marvelous time.

    <p>In August 2001, George W. Bush ignored a warning that Osama Bin Laden
would attack the <span class="caps">US</span>. Thousands died.</p>
<p>In March 2003, Bush started an un­nec­es­sary war against Iraq.
Tens of thousands died.</p>
<p>In August 2005, Bush ignored warnings that a major hurricane
would strike New Orleans, and stayed on vacation.
He played guitar in Arizona while New Orleans drowned.
Uncounted thousands died.</p>
<p>Not until Wednesday did he return to Washington.
Even now, he has yet to show leadership.
Photo ops are not leadership. Platitudes are not leadership.</p>
<p>For four years, the Bush ad­min­is­tra­tion has played the terror card,
warning us again and again that terrorists would strike our cities.
Billions have been spent on homeland defense.

College. Today, we started on per­spec­tive. We began by watching a
45-minute <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cloudband.com/frames.mhtml/magazine/articles/rev_dinwiddie_surface_0699.html">video by David Hockney</a>, where he contrasts three paintings:
a Canaletto painting of Venice, and two Chinese scrolls painted
70 years apart.</p>
<p>The Canaletto is a classic <a class="reference external" href="http://drawsketch.about.com/library/weekly/aa021603c.htm">two-point linear per­spec­tive</a> painting.
Both of the Chinese scrolls show trips by the emperor along the
Grand Canal. The first one, by Wang Hui, is 27 inches high and 72 feet wide!
It uses multiple per­spec­tive to show scenes, in a manner
that is strange to my Western eyes. Hockney demon­strates how
effective it is. For example, he shows a corner where <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/07/20/SurfaceIsIllusionButSoIsDepth.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>On Saturday, I bought <em>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</em>
at CostCo. On leaving, the checker told me that I had bought the
887th copy at the store. This was 1pm, three hours after opening,
so they were selling at the rate of five per minute.</p>
<p>I started reading it last night. After two chapters,
when I had seen far too many references to earlier books
that I didn’t recall, I decided that it was time to
re-read the earlier books. I’m a fast reader, but I don’t
retain material very well.</p>
<p>In the first chapter of the first book, I came across
an ironically prophetic statement, made by Professor McGonagall
