<p>I gave the following speech to Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters on June 25th, 2003, as Speech
#4, &quot;Show What You Mean&quot;. Clearly, I&#8217;ve reused some material from
<a class="reference external" href="/blog/2003/06/11/Bloomsday.html">my earlier post about Bloomsday</a>.
I&#8217;m also finding that I take longer to
deliver a speech to an audience than I do when rehearsing, so I cut some of
the material on the day to fit the seven-minute&nbsp;limit.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve uploaded <a class="reference external" href="http://www.george-reilly.com/photos/Bloomsday-2003/">some photos of the reading</a>
to one of my other&nbsp;websites.</p>

<p>I detest George W. Bush and his ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion. The war, the economy, the
en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment, the judicial battles. I loathe just about everything that
comes out of the White House. I want that man <em>gone</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been following the Democratic pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial candidates with some
interest for the last few months. Right now, I feel like I&#8217;m a yellow dog
Democrat. I don&#8217;t care who wins in 2004, just so long as it&#8217;s a&nbsp;Democrat.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really true, however. I&#8217;d much rather have a candidate that I
have some enthusiasm for, rather than the lesser of two evils: such <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/06/12/HowardDeanForPresident.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I have recently become involved with the upcoming local cel&shy;e&shy;bra&shy;tion of
Bloomsday, on June 16th. James Joyce&#8217;s <em>Ulysses</em> takes place on June 16th,
1904. In Seattle and elsewhere, fans of the book re-enact portions of the
book. In Dublin, Joyce has spawned a whole industry: ironic, when you
consider how little recog&shy;ni&shy;tion he received there during his lifetime. No
doubt, the Joycean industry will go into overdrive next year for the&nbsp;centenary.</p>
<p>The Seattle group has been working its way through the book since 1998.
This year, we are reading Chapters 8 and 9, &quot;Lestry&shy;go&shy;ni&shy;ans&quot; and &quot;Scylla and
Charybdis&quot;. <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/06/11/Bloomsday.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been too busy in the last few weeks to post anything here. Mostly
because I&#8217;ve been busy with work. Partially because I&#8217;m too disgusted with
Iraq to say anything useful: Win the war and lose the peace.&nbsp;Feh!</p>
<p>In the last few days, I&#8217;ve been at home taking care of Emma. On Friday
morning, she had a Morton&#8217;s neuroma removed from her left foot. A nerve
running through the space between a couple of her toes had become enlarged
to about a centimeter in diameter, and it had been causing her a lot of
pain. She wasn&#8217;t <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/04/22/HerLeftFoot.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Emma got this list of &quot;why did the chicken cross the road?&quot; jokes off one

<p>Peter Turnley is a pho&shy;to&shy;jour&shy;nal&shy;ist who covered the first Gulf War.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0212/pt_intro.html">The Unseen Gulf War</a>
is his collection of previously un&shy;pub&shy;lished photos from
that war. The photos present no political viewpoint, but what they do
&quot;represent is a part of a more accurate picture of what really does happen
in war&quot;. Warning: there are a number of graphic images of&nbsp;corpses.</p>
