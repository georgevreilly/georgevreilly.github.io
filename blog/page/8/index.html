<p>Having made an enemy of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a> a few years earlier,
Flashman now finds himself compelled by Bismarck to im&shy;per&shy;son&shy;ate a Danish prince
in a German duchy, taking his place in a marriage to the duchess.
Flashman is a dop&shy;pel&shy;gänger for Carl Gustaf and with his talent for languages,
he&#8217;s able to pull it off.
At first he believes that Carl Gustaf is re&shy;cu&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ing from an em&shy;bar&shy;rass&shy;ing case of the pox,
and he settles into enjoying his role.
Then he learns that <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/06/26/ReviewRoyalFlash.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>When histories of 21st-century Britain are written,
the Brexit referendum will un&shy;doubt&shy;ed&shy;bly be prominent.
A small majority of Britons voted to do the un&shy;think&shy;able,
to secede from the European Union.
Xenophobes and racists in coalition with the mar&shy;gin&shy;al&shy;ized and dis&shy;af&shy;fect&shy;ed
have delivered a big fuck you to London and to Brussels.
Some had cast a protest vote,
not believing that Leave would actually win.
Remorse im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly set in,
as the pound has dropped to a thirty-year low,
billions in <span class="caps">EU</span> funding is set to dry up,
and prime minister Cameron has resigned.
Scotland and Northern Ireland both voted Remain
and now both are making noises about their own in&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dence from the United Kingdom.

<p>As I watched <em>In&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dence Day 2</em>,
I disliked it more and more,
to the point where I was seething with anger
at the stupidity of the plot and the&nbsp;characters.</p>
<p>The original 1996 <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(1996_film)">In&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dence Day</a> was at least a watchable B-movie.
The sequel is leaden and plodding and makes no sense.
The characters are per&shy;func&shy;to&shy;ry and un&shy;in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing,
while the comic reliefs are teeth-grindingly irritating.
You might assume that the young pilot who is the son of Will Smith&#8217;s character
would be the lead in this film,
but he&#8217;s sidelined here by Liam Hemsworth as the Top Gun&nbsp;jock.</p>
<p>My anger is <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/06/24/ReviewIndependenceDayResurgence.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>Perhaps I&#8217;ve been spoilt,
but most of the speakers at the technical meetups and con&shy;fer&shy;ences that I go to
have something to say and say it well.
I&#8217;ve also been to hundreds of Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters meetings
and I&#8217;ve heard many speakers at all&nbsp;levels.</p>
<p>I went to a tech meetup tonight and I sat through two bad hour-long pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tions.
The first speaker should have eliminated the first 20 minutes of his talk,
a self-indulgent ramble about various other projects that he had attempted,
which shed no light on his main topic.
He could easily have eliminated another 15 minutes from the rest of his talk
and it would have been the better <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/06/23/BadSpeakersAtMeetups.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

we had one more rehearsal to go before
our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2016.html">2016 Reading</a> of <em>Ulysses</em> for Bloomsday.
That was tonight.
Mostly we worked out seating and other logistics.
We are in&shy;ter&shy;cut&shy;ting two different chapters,
with the readers playing different roles in each chapter,
so it&#8217;s a small but satisfying ac&shy;com&shy;plish&shy;ment
to have a seating arrange&shy;ment that works for both&nbsp;chapters.</p>
