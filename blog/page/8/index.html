<p>It's 1592 and Elizabeth I has ruled England for nearly 35 years.
The Virgin Queen has never named her heir,
creating both un&shy;cer&shy;tain&shy;ty and op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ty.
John Shake&shy;speare used to be an &quot;in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gencer&quot; for the late Sir Francis Walsingham,
Eliz&shy;a&shy;beth's spymaster.
With reluctance, Shake&shy;speare is drawn back into that life when the Earl of Essex insists
upon com&shy;mi&shy;sion&shy;ing him to find a woman who should be dead—a survivor of the lost Roanoke settlement has been sighted in London.
Essex wants her as does his mysterious ally, a dangerous Irishman called <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2015/03/07/ReviewRevenger.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>India has split apart by 2047,
into a dozen competing states desperate for the life-giving monsoon rains.
New castes have appeared, as have the new gender of nutes.
Aeais (artificial in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gences) abound
but are strictly proscribed from attaining full sentience.
And an asteroid with seven-billion-year-old images of now-living people has been discovered.</p>
<p>McDonald draws together nine people from different walks of life,
weaving their tales into one tapestry.
India, ancient yet up-to-the-minute, is the vibrant backdrop for this explosion of ideas.</p>

<p>It's the fiftieth an&shy;niver&shy;sary of the death of my maternal grand&shy;fa&shy;ther,
George Victor Clery, on 3rd March 1965.
It did not come as a shock to the family.
His health was often poor and he had been ill for some time.
He was born a month premature on 30th March 1900
and his mother was told she would never rear him.
Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, he grew up to become an avid golfer and tennis player,
to marry and father five children,
and to live all the way to a brief retirement,
though not quite long enough to see any of his grand&shy;chil&shy;dren.

<p>We use <a class="reference external" href="http://nose.readthedocs.org/">Nose</a> to run unit tests.
I noticed that we had some tests that weren't being run,
and it took me some time to work out why.
Eventually, I found this <a class="reference external" href="https://www.hyperink.com/blog/?p=22">checklist</a>,
which told me to &quot;make sure the files in your tests directory are not executable&quot;.</p>
<p>A quick <tt class="docutils literal">chmod <span class="pre">-x</span> *.py</tt> later and <tt class="docutils literal">nosetests project/tests</tt> suddenly found all the tests.</p>
<p>Now that I know what to look for, I found this in the Nose docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to note that the default behavior of nose
is to not include tests from files which are executable.</p>

<p>When the Norse raiders arrive in the English village,
Raven, the young outsider who was found two years before with no memory,
realizes that he speaks their language.
He is drawn to them and he joins them in their quest for glory, plunder, and battle.</p>
<p>After a slow start, the plot moves along with enough fighting to hold one's interest.
Aside from Raven, the characters are poorly drawn,
with little to dis&shy;tin&shy;guish or motivate them.</p>

<p>Patterson Wells lives dan&shy;ger&shy;ous&shy;ly, clearing fallen trees in hurricane season.
Since the death of his young son a few years ago, he's been lost in a self-de&shy;struc&shy;tive fog.
His life becomes entangled with that of his neighbor's grown son, Junior,
another lost soul.
Wells and Junior bond after a fashion,
as their lives spiral further out of control,
with drug deals gone bad, drunken sprees, and murders.</p>
<p>Fas&shy;ci&shy;nat&shy;ing in a grim can't-look-away-from-the-trainwreck fashion.
Whitmer writes lyrically about broken lives and disposable people.</p>

<p>Five years ago, the Greatcoats were the lawgivers of Tristia.
And then the good king was deposed by the dukes and the Greatcoats were broken up.
Now despised, only a few are left, taking work as caravan guards and sellswords.
Falcio, the former First Cantor, finally starts to care again,
as he is sucked into the dukes' intrigues.</p>
<p><em>Traitor's Blade</em> starts out light-hearted and joky,
growing darker and more passionate
as Falcio opens himself up and re&shy;dis&shy;cov&shy;ers his honor.
De Castell is a fine sto&shy;ry&shy;teller and the action moves quickly.</p>
