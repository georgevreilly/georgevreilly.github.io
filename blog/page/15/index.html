    <p>Quick!
How many days between 2014-11-29 and 2016-05-17?
What&#8217;s the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand on an analog clock
when the time reads&nbsp;11:37?</p>
<p>The hard way to compute the difference between the two dates
is to start counting back months and days until you reach the earlier date,
or equiv&shy;a&shy;lent&shy;ly to count forward from the beginning.
(Don&#8217;t forget that Feb 2016 has 29 days but Feb 2015 has 28.)
Similarly with the angle between the&nbsp;hands.</p>
<p>The easier way is to compute the number of units between the first point
and some reference (or base) point,
to do the same for the second point,
and to subtract the two&nbsp;numbers.</p>

    <p>Two tran&shy;si&shy;tions at Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters tonight:
Kim gave her last speech before moving to California
and Shasti gave her tenth speech,
which earned her her <a class="reference external" href="http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/toastmasters-speech-0-competent-communicator/">Competent Com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tor</a>&nbsp;award.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always exciting to see people proceed through a series of speeches
and achieve milestones like the <span class="caps">CC</span>.
You see them get better with each speech.
The awkward fumbling hesitation of the early speeches
is supplanted by growing fluidity and confidence,
as the practice and the eval&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tions help them&nbsp;improve.</p>

<p>Jet Butler lives on an isolated mesa in New Mexico.
One of her few friends is a suspect in a murder.
Cordelia Morgan, an outsider,
who turns out to be far more than she seems,
is also interested in the murder,
which seems to be somehow tied up in the sale of water&nbsp;rights.</p>
<p>This never quite gelled for me.
Despite the author&#8217;s flair for de&shy;scrip&shy;tion,
I found the plot confusing and I was not engaged with the two&nbsp;pro&shy;tag&shy;o&shy;nists.</p>

<p>Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy),
a self-effacing, overweight, desk-bound <span class="caps">CIA</span> mission controller,
spends her days in a verminous <span class="caps">CIA</span> basement
talking into the earpiece of her glamorous field agent coun&shy;ter&shy;part.
When he&#8217;s killed before her remote eyes and other field agents are com&shy;pro&shy;mised,
she goes into the field for the first time
and soon blossoms into a deadly&nbsp;agent.</p>
<p>I had never seen McCarthy in anything before and
I assumed that <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_(2015_film)">Spy</a> would be a dumb, gross-out comedy.
It was better than I feared

    <p>I saw a packet of triple chocolate cookies
and I wondered, “Triple chocolate?”.
I googled and found several recipes,
all of which used cocoa powder with
either a couple of varieties of chocolate chips,
say semisweet and white,
or a couple of varieties of chocolate,
such as dark chocolate and milk chocolate,
often&nbsp;melted.</p>
<p>The Keebler&#8217;s cookie was un&shy;mem&shy;o&shy;rable.
The recipes sounded&nbsp;better.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World">Jurassic World</a> is an un&shy;nec&shy;es&shy;sary retread of the Jurassic Park franchise.
New, scarier, smarter monster Imperator Furiosa¹ breaks out of its enclosure and wreaks havoc,
killing humans and dinosaurs for pleasure.
Plucky kids—or are they darn, meddling kids?—aided by unlikely romantic couple—<em>and</em> by ve&shy;loci&shy;rap&shy;tors and a T. Rex—manage to save the day.
Meanwhile, greedy human villains plan to profit off the mess
but get eaten before the end to audience applause.
Chris Pratt delivers scruffy heroics
while Bryce Dallas Howard runs around the entire movie
in ridiculous heels without breaking either an ankle or a&nbsp;heel.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Man_(film)">Ant-Man</a> is a light&shy;weight but appealing entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Decades ago, Hank Pym discovered the Pym Particle and invented the Ant-Man suit,
which allowed him to shrink to the size of an ant.
He buries the technology, believing it&#8217;s too dangerous.
Now his former protégé Darren Cross is close
to perfecting the Yel&shy;low&shy;jack&shy;et shrinking suit and selling it to Hydra.
Pym and his daughter Hope recruit Scott Lang,
a former burglar, to don the Ant-Man suit to stop&nbsp;Cross.</p>
<p>Much of the movie is played for laughs.
Unlike <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/03/05/ReviewDeadpool.html">Deadpool</a>, these are <span class="caps">PG</span>-13 laughs.

<p>We married on May 6th, 2000.
We went to Vancouver for the weekend to celebrate our sixteenth an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
It was our first trip out of town since August,
when we returned from two months in Europe.
We drove up on Friday,
stopping in Marysville to have lunch with a friend
and to buy some clothes at the Outlet&nbsp;Mall.</p>
<p>On Saturday, we went up Grouse Mountain for the first time ever,
to enjoy the views on a clear day.
After that, we drove along the coast in West Vancouver
as far as the scenic village at Horseshoe Bay
and the Whytecliff Park.
We concluded the day with a fine dinner at&nbsp;Adesso.</p>
