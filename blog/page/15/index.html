    <p>I spent the last 90 minutes reading Facebook,
and my feed has been absolutely over&shy;whelmed with Orlando-related posts,
be they grieving, discussing homophobia, calling for gun control,
or reacting to reactions.
I&#8217;ve never seen such a skewed set of posts.
Some of it is surely Facebook catering to what it knows are my interests,
but it seems like the vast majority of my friends
and the pages that I follow can talk of nothing else.
Even Trump/Clinton/Sanders articles, except as they pertain to this,
have tem&shy;porar&shy;i&shy;ly&nbsp;dis&shy;ap&shy;peared.</p>
<p>So far, I have seen nothing useful from Republican politi&shy;cians
regarding gun control or&nbsp;homophobia.</p>

    <p>I woke up this morning to news of another American massacre:
a lone gunman had murdered 50 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando,
and injured another 53 people.
It was the worst mass shooting in <span class="caps">US</span> history and also the worst hate&nbsp;crime.</p>
<p>I put it out of my head for the afternoon while I attended an old friend&#8217;s wedding,
but it&#8217;s been at the forefront of my mind ever&nbsp;since.</p>
<p>Only in America could we put up with massacre after massacre,
yet not find the political will to do anything meaningful about gun violence.

    <p>Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee for the 2016 Pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial race.
Although Sanders has not yet ended his campaign, he can&#8217;t win.
I voted for Sanders in the Washington state caucus
and I still have his yard sign sitting in my front&nbsp;yard.</p>
<p>Unlike some diehard Sanders&#8217; supporters,
I have absolutely no qualms getting behind Clinton.
She&#8217;s one of the most qualified candidates ever to run.
If elected, she will be on the right side of many of the issues I care about
and she will make good ap&shy;point&shy;ments to the Supreme Court.
She&#8217;s competent and capable and gets things done.

We had our first full readthrough at tonight&#8217;s rehearsal,
one hour fifty five minutes.
Next week, our dress&nbsp;rehearsal.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve bought only three cars in my life:
a new red <span class="caps">VW</span> Golf in April 1992, when I moved to Seattle;
an 18-month-old black <span class="caps">VW</span> Golf in April 2002;
and a 2007 Mazda 3 in April&nbsp;2016.</p>
<p>The 2001 <span class="caps">VW</span> was still running fine and had recently passed the 150,000-mile mark.
However, it, like the 1992 Golf, had a manual trans&shy;mis&shy;sion (a “stick shift”).
Emma had a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mortons-neuroma/home/ovc-20202652">Morton&#8217;s Neuroma</a> removed from the ball of her left foot around 2003.

drivers need to change gear often.

but he&#8217;s been seconded to the task force in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gat&shy;ing a murder.
The dead man had bullied Fin and his friends throughout their childhood.
Returning home brings up a lot that had been long buried: secrets and re&shy;sent&shy;ments.
Fin&#8217;s childhood and youth is gradually revealed throughout the book,
informing his present-day in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion.
He acted badly in the past and that has not been&nbsp;forgotten.</p>

A Kindle All Star author by the name of Joanne Clancy

<p>There was supposed to be a second showing of <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/06/02/ReviewTheQueenOfIreland.html">The Queen of Ireland</a> doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary
this morning at the <span class="caps">SIFF</span> Uptown,
preceded by a panel discussion on Marriage Equality.
We attended the discussion,
which was moderated by Phil Grant, the Consul General of Ireland.
The three panelists were
Rory O&#8217;Neill, aka Panti Bliss, out of drag,
the accidental activist who became the face of marriage equality in Ireland;
Mayor Ed Murray, an Irish-American and Washington state&#8217;s best-known gay politi&shy;cian;
and Gary Gates, an <span class="caps">LGBT</span> de&shy;mog&shy;ra&shy;ph&shy;er, married to an Irishman,
who advised the Irish&nbsp;cam&shy;paign&shy;ers.</p>
<p>I have a strong interest in marriage equality,
