<p>Marsh Tanner is a San Francisco private in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tor.
His secretary Peggy is starting to unravel,
as she's been getting sexually harassing phone calls for months,
which she's hidden from Marsh.
Thing is, she's also started to develop a case of
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome">Stockholm syndrome</a>
with her stalker.
Marsh discovers more about Peggy—and him&shy;self—than he really wants to.</p>
<p>Moderately enjoyable.
I found the plot and the characters plausible,
unlike so many modern stories.</p>

<p>My mother's mother's sister, known to all of us as Auntie Pat,
was born on January 2nd, 1915, in London.
My mother and a few other family members will join her today for her 100th birthday party.
I understand that the Queen has been notified
and will be sending a telegram of con&shy;grat&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tions,
but can't attend in person.</p>
<p>Pat is frail but her mind is still good,
and she continues to live by herself in her own home in Bournemouth, England.
In the last decade, Pat has <em>twice</em> emigrated to New Zealand,
but it didn't work out either time.</p>
<p>Pat married only once, in her sixties,
to a Polish émigré who <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2015/01/02/GreatAuntPatAt100.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>John Buchan's classic novel,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirty-Nine_Steps">The Thirty-Nine Steps</a>,
takes place in the summer of 1914,
weeks before the Great War breaks out.
Richard Hannay, who made his fortune in South Africa,
is bored of London.
When his neighbor is murdered after disclosing a spy plot to him,
Hannay is forced to go on the run
to avoid being arrested by the police or killed by the spies.
He spends much of the book hiding out in rural Scotland,
before returning to London.</p>
<p>This proto-thriller—or “shocker” as Buchan called it—is still an en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing story.</p>

We in Seattle will enter the New Year in 4½ hours.</p>
<p>For me personally, it was a reasonably good year.
My health remained good,
I had a new <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2013/12/17/JoiningCookbrite.html">job</a>,
we had a good summer vacation,
and generally enjoyed ourselves.
Emma's health was not so great,

has been out of commission for months.
I've been meaning to replace it for a long time,

as I realized that otherwise I would have no posts at all for 2014.
I received only a handful of complaints about its absence;
if there had been more, I would have fixed it sooner.</p>

<p>Tuesday December 10th was my last day at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cozi.com">Cozi</a>.
I had recently rolled off a major project that lasted for most of a year,
and the timing was good to go do something else.
In my six years there,
I made lasting friend&shy;ships and I built a lot of software that makes me proud.
Cozi has about 15 engineers, small enough that I worked on most of the software,
notably on the web services that power everything else
and on the web client ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion,
though not, alas, on the iOS or Android ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions.
Cozi was a great place to work
and I knew I wanted to replicate what I valued <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2013/12/17/JoiningCookBrite.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>From October 1996 to May 1997, I wrote a number of sample components
for the then-new <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages">Active Server Pages</a>

I worked for Mi&shy;cro&shy;Crafts, a consulting company in Redmond, WA;

    <p>I've spent some time this evening profiling a Python ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion on Windows,
trying to find out why it was so much slower than on Mac or Linux.
The ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion is an in-house build tool which reads a number of config files,
then writes some output files.</p>
<p>Using the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vrplumber.com/programming/runsnakerun/">Run&shy;SnakeRun</a> Python profile viewer on Windows,
two things im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly leapt out at me:
we were running <tt class="docutils literal">os.stat</tt> a lot
and <tt class="docutils literal">file.close</tt> was really expensive.</p>
<p>A quick test convinced me that we were <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stat.html">stat-ing</a> the same files over and over.
It was a com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion of explicit checks and implicit code,
like <tt class="docutils literal">os.walk</tt> calling <tt class="docutils literal">os.path.isdir</tt>.
I wrote a little cache that memoizes the results,
