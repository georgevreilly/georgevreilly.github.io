    <p>Reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.alternet.org/economy/why-eyewear-industry-incredible-rip">Why the Eyewear Industry Is An Incredible Rip-Off</a>
reminds me that I need to get some new glasses.
I had my eyes tested last month and there is a small change in the pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion.
I've had my current glasses for about six years.</p>
<p>From ages 12 to 44, I needed only distance lenses for my myopia,
but then in the space of just a few months,
I developed the classic problem of middle age:
it became hard for me to read.
I got a pair of glasses with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.allaboutvision.com/lenses/progressives.htm">pro&shy;gres&shy;sive</a> lenses.
I was used to having fairly clear peripheral vision

speak at <a class="reference external" href="http://townhallseattle.org/">Town Hall Seattle</a> tonight.
He spoke about the topic of his new book,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Divide:_American_Injustice_in_the_Age_of_the_Wealth_Gap">The Divide</a>,
which covers inequality in the United States.
After several years of covering white-collar crime in Wall Street
after the financial collapse of 2008,
and not seeing <em>any</em> pros&shy;e&shy;cu&shy;tions,
he got curious about what the criminal justice system is like for the poor.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-nypds-work-stoppage-is-surreal-20141231">Community policing</a>
is harsh in many poor com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ties,
like Ferguson and Staten Island,
where the police regularly issue tickets for minor in&shy;frac&shy;tions.
Those being summonsed can ill-afford the fines,
often leading to worse con&shy;se&shy;quences.
The U.S. prison population is now twice as high as it was in 1991

<p>Marsh Tanner is a San Francisco private in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tor.
His secretary Peggy is starting to unravel,
as she's been getting sexually harassing phone calls for months,
which she's hidden from Marsh.
Thing is, she's also started to develop a case of
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome">Stockholm syndrome</a>
with her stalker.
Marsh discovers more about Peggy—and him&shy;self—than he really wants to.</p>
<p>Moderately enjoyable.
I found the plot and the characters plausible,
unlike so many modern stories.</p>

<p>My mother's mother's sister, known to all of us as Auntie Pat,

My mother and a few other family members will join her today for her 100th birthday party.

<p>Pat is frail but her mind is still good,
and she continues to live by herself in her own home in Bournemouth, England.
In the last decade, Pat has <em>twice</em> emigrated to New Zealand,
but it didn't work out either time.</p>

<p>John Buchan's classic novel,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirty-Nine_Steps">The Thirty-Nine Steps</a>,
takes place in the summer of 1914,
weeks before the Great War breaks out.
Richard Hannay, who made his fortune in South Africa,
is bored of London.
When his neighbor is murdered after disclosing a spy plot to him,
Hannay is forced to go on the run
to avoid being arrested by the police or killed by the spies.
He spends much of the book hiding out in rural Scotland,
before returning to London.</p>
<p>This proto-thriller—or “shocker” as Buchan called it—is still an en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing story.</p>

My health remained good,
I had a new <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2013/12/17/JoiningCookbrite.html">job</a>,
