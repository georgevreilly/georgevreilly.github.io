<p><strong>Approve Referendum 71</strong>.
If you're eligible to vote in Washington state in November,
remember this: <a class="reference external" href="http://approvereferendum71.org/">Approve Referendum 71</a>.</p>
<p>On May 18, 2009, Governor Gregoire signed <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hslda.org/Legislation/State/wa/2009/WASB5688/default.asp">Senate Bill 5688</a>,
aka the “ev&shy;ery&shy;thing but marriage bill” or the Domestic Part&shy;ner&shy;ship Law,
a law ensuring that all Washington families are treated the same,
with the same pro&shy;tec&shy;tions, the same rights,
and the same oblig&shy;a&shy;tions as their neighbors.
Under this law, registered domestic partners (same-sex couples
and opposite-sex couples with at least one partner over age 62),
and married couples, are treated equally
under the law in all parts of the state.</p>
<p>Key rights and oblig&shy;a&shy;tions in the law include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Death benefits for the partners of police <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/08/31/APPROVEReferendum71.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></li></ul>

<p>I had about 60 apparently corrupted photos on a Com&shy;pact&shy;Flash card this evening.
It might have been due to Lightroom going berserk,
but it was more likely from my pulling the card reader out of the computer
without ejecting it first.</p>
<p>The photos wouldn't show up under Mac, Linux, or Windows.
I tried to <tt class="docutils literal">chkdsk</tt> the card under Windows, which complained about a “raw” disk.
That led me to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.z-a-recovery.com/info_zar32.htm">ZAR</a>, the Zero Assumption Recovery toolkit.
The evaluation copy retrieved the photos very nicely.
Whew!</p>

<p>Das Barbecü is Wagner's <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen">Ring Cycle</a> trans&shy;plant&shy;ed to Texas for comic effect.
We saw it at Seattle's ACT Theatre tonight.
The Ring Cycle is currently playing at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattleopera.org/tickets/ring/">Seattle Opera</a>,
who com&shy;mis&shy;sioned Das Barbecü in 1991.</p>
<p>I'm no opera buff and certainly no Wagnerian.
After sitting through four hours of <em>Tristan und Isolde</em> years ago—<em>Ach du lieber Gott! Mein Arsch! Meinen Ohren!</em>—I told Emma that my limit for opera was two-and-a-half hours.
I have never seen any part of the Ring Cycle
and had only cursory knowledge of the story,
and it detracted not one whit from my enjoyment of Das Barbecü.</p>

the third-longest-serving senator of all time,
elected in 1962, as soon as he became eligible at 30.</p>

This is es&shy;sen&shy;tial&shy;ly what I'm doing when I sit down

<p>If only you'd make some more in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gent guesses for yourself,
you might be able to solve more of your problems.</p>

<p>You probably don't understand very much about what you're doing.
I have enormous depth and breadth of experience which informs my in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion.
I am—no false modesty here—a master of debugging.
The extra context helps me hone in on a solution more often than not.</p>

<p>Patricia Teeling wants to experience more of life than farming and university,
and moves to Dublin to be a science teacher.
She quickly finds herself adrift,
belonging no more in her country home yet not of the city.
She is soon drawn to the married Englishman who lives downstairs.
His wife is murdered after she receives obscene telephone calls.
Then an attractive man with a limp—&shy;dubbed the Goose&shy;foot—ap&shy;pears.</p>
<p>While the author has an enviable command of English,
I found his characters to be tiresome and in&shy;scrutable yet un&shy;ac&shy;count&shy;ably eloquent.

<p>When we were in Spain in July, we visited the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salvador-dali.org/museus/figueres/en_index.html">Dalí museum</a> in Figueres.
The museum is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>'s monument to himself; he spent his latter years building it.
The guided tour was well worth the money.
I came away believing that Dalí was both enormously talented and full of shit.</p>
<p>The next day, purely by chance, we passed a sign for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salvador-dali.org/museus/pubol/en_index.html">Gala's castle</a>
at Pubol while driving around in the coun&shy;try&shy;side.
We spent half the morning looking around the castle that Dalí
had bought for Gala, his wife and muse.

for my point-and-shoot Canon Elph.
I brought my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/04/25/UbuntuNetbookRemix904.aspx">Linux netbook</a> along, which has a built-in SD card reader,
and the cards worked fine with that.</p>
<p>But they didn't work at all in any of the external card readers that I have,
and I had to resort to a USB cable to transfer photos from
the camera to my other computers.</p>

<p>Senator Patty Murray visited us at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cozi.com/">Cozi</a> this morning.
She was there to hear from small business people about healthcare reform
and she met with half-a-dozen local small business owners,

<p>Jason runs a record store.
When they decided to insure all of their employees,
it meant that everyone had to take a pay cut.
One guy didn't want to take part, but Jason convinced him.
Weeks later, that guy broke his arm and ended up in the emergency room.
