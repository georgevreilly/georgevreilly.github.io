The hunch&shy;backed lawyer Matthew Shardlake
has been sent to York by Archbishop Cranmer to meet the Royal Progress,
where Henry VIII is to accept formal surrender from those
who had earlier rebelled.
Shardlake is to hear petitions on the king's behalf,
but really he is there to ensure that a high-ranking con&shy;spir&shy;a&shy;tor
is brought safely back to the Tower of London.
He stumbles upon a cache of secret papers,
which leads to a series of attempts upon his life.</p>

an ambitious senator arrives from the capital to take over.
Tavi finally comes into his own,

Far to the south, Amara and Bernard accompany the First Lord, Gaius Sixtus,

<p>My friends Frank and Lyndol met 32 years ago today,
the day they celebrate as their an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
For several years, Emma and I have brought them out for dinner on this date.
We also celebrate Lyn's birthday,
which falls next week.</p>
<p>Frank's health has been poor for some years,
but it's grown worse this year.
He spent six weeks in hospital in September and October.
He's home now, but he's in <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.motss/browse_thread/thread/38e9223106252317">hospice care</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, we try to see him often,
since he rarely feels strong enough to leave the house,
even in a wheelchair.
We almost always find him in good form,
glad to see us and ready with his stories.</p>
<p>He's somewhat stronger <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/17/ToFrankAndLyndol.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>It snowed in Seattle yesterday.
We drove over to Sammamish last night to my CEO's house
for the Holiday Party.
The snow wasn't sticking to the roads,
so although visibility wasn't great,
getting there and back was not difficult.</p>
<p>It was cold today and colder tonight.
I saw only a light dusting of snow fall today,
but the snow that was melting earlier has refrozen.</p>
<p>We had to go out this evening,
over to Burien to see Frank.
The main roads were fine,
but we had a slightly alarming descent
on a hill near us as we headed over there.
Coming home, we had a couple of unpleasant minutes

<p>Lots of new babies around.</p>
<p>Dilip in North Carolina emailed me the other day
and mentioned the recent birth of his daughter, Anuragini.
And Alan in Dublin emailed me this morning,
to tell me of the birth of his daughter, Beth.</p>
<p>My sister, Michelle Bowles, is due to give birth on the 19th
to the first Reilly grandchild.
We arrive in Dublin on the 21st.
First babies tend to be born late,
so we may get there before the baby does.
She and David have elected not to learn the gender of the baby,
so I addressed their Christmas card to &quot;Michelle, David, and TBD&quot;.</p>

<p>We've gone high-def over the last month.
First, Emma bought a <a class="reference external" href="http://www2.panasonic.com/consumer-electronics/support/Televisions/VIERA-Plasma-HDTVs/model.TH-42PZ80U.S">42&quot; 1080p plasma Panasonic HDTV</a>
to replace the 32&quot; CRT TV in our living room.
Although it's wider, it's not over&shy;whelm&shy;ing,
as the slender box sits further back.
The picture's pretty good—at least when you give it a good signal.</p>
<p>To take advantage of it required a cascade of upgrades.
Our old TiVo served us well for eight years;
ap&shy;point&shy;ment TV has long been alien to us.
It's dis&shy;con&shy;nect&shy;ed now, replaced the other day
by a DirecTV Plus DVR and a new satellite dish.
I had heard bad things about the older DirecTV DVRs,
but I have no complaints about this <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/10/HDTV.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I look out the window.
Driz&shy;zling—not too heavy—I'll ride to work.
Pack my clothes into the panier bag.
Spandex tights, coat, yellow jacket, helmet, gloves: on they go.
Bike's in the garage, seems okay, slap on the bag.
Pull it out, reset the odometer.
17 minutes today?</p>
<p>Ignite the blinky lights, pull away.
Down the side roads, until I'm compelled to take the arterial.
Press the crosswalk button, wait for a break in the traffic.
Two minutes, three, does this fucking light <em>ever</em> change?
Off like a shot, past Jefferson Park.
Maybe they'll finish by next summer.
Hit the next light at 2:30.
A long, gentle uphill for the next 8 minutes.

<p>There's little that I miss about Irish cooking.
One notable exception is Brown Bread aka Brown Soda Bread.
I don't know of any bakery that makes it in the States,
though I've found it at a couple of Irish pubs.
The main difficulty in making it is
finding the coarse-ground wholemeal flour.
The usual fine-ground stuff has the wrong texture.</p>
<p>I know of only one place in the Seattle area that carries
the right flour and that's
The Grainery, 13629 1st Ave S, Burien, WA 98168; (206) 244-5015.
I bought some flour there today,
made a loaf, and brought the loaf and a 10lb bag of flour
to an Irish friend's birthday <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/11/30/IrishBrownBread.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>For decades, Detroit has fought a rearguard action against
change—seat&shy;belts, CAFE standards for increased fuel efficiency,
met&shy;ri&shy;ca&shy;tion, renewable energy, building gas guzzling SUVs
instead of hybrids, all come to mind.</p>
<p>Change is needed.
The current management must go.
The big three must build vehicles that make sense.</p>

in Wednes&shy;day's NYT lands in the vicinity of the mark.</p>
<p>He ignores one big reason for the higher costs of American cars,
the cost of company-funded healthcare.</p>
<p>But another article in the same day's paper,

<p>My formerly trusty Casio Exilim EX-Z1000 camera went berserk one night in September.
The zoom lens wedged open and nothing I did would persuade it to retract
into the case or take more photos.
The zoom had grown a little tem&shy;per&shy;me&shy;n&shy;tal in the preceding month,
but I didn't expect cat&shy;a&shy;stroph&shy;ic failure.</p>
<p>The other hardware failure was far more upsetting.</p>
<p>From Christmas until August, I ripped most of our CD collection
with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/">Exact Audio Copy</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Lossless_Audio_Codec">FLAC</a> (Free Lossless Audio Codec).
Since FLAC is lossless and open source,
I figured I'd never need to rip the CDs again.
I also wrote a Python script to convert the FLACs to MP3s with <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/11/18/HardwareLazarus.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
