<p><a class="reference external" href="http://xkcd.com/627/">XKCD's Tech Support Cheat Sheet</a> nails it!
This is es&shy;sen&shy;tial&shy;ly what I'm doing when I sit down
at your computer and dig you out of your latest hole.</p>
<p>If only you'd make some more in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gent guesses for yourself,
you might be able to solve more of your problems.</p>
<p>But it's not quite that simple.</p>
<p>You probably don't understand very much about what you're doing.
I have enormous depth and breadth of experience which informs my in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion.
I am—no false modesty here—a master of debugging.
The extra context helps me hone in on a solution more often than not.</p>
<p>Still, do give the flowchart a shot.

<p>Patricia Teeling wants to experience more of life than farming and university,
and moves to Dublin to be a science teacher.
She quickly finds herself adrift,
belonging no more in her country home yet not of the city.
She is soon drawn to the married Englishman who lives downstairs.
His wife is murdered after she receives obscene telephone calls.
Then an attractive man with a limp—&shy;dubbed the Goose&shy;foot—ap&shy;pears.</p>
<p>While the author has an enviable command of English,
I found his characters to be tiresome and in&shy;scrutable yet un&shy;ac&shy;count&shy;ably eloquent.

<p>When we were in Spain in July, we visited the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salvador-dali.org/museus/figueres/en_index.html">Dalí museum</a> in Figueres.
The museum is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>'s monument to himself; he spent his latter years building it.
The guided tour was well worth the money.
I came away believing that Dalí was both enormously talented and full of shit.</p>
<p>The next day, purely by chance, we passed a sign for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salvador-dali.org/museus/pubol/en_index.html">Gala's castle</a>
at Pubol while driving around in the coun&shy;try&shy;side.
We spent half the morning looking around the castle that Dalí
had bought for Gala, his wife and muse.

<p>Before we left on our trip, I picked up a pair of 4GB&nbsp;SD cards
for my point-and-shoot Canon Elph.
I brought my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/04/25/UbuntuNetbookRemix904.aspx">Linux netbook</a> along, which has a built-in SD card reader,
and the cards worked fine with that.</p>
<p>But they didn't work at all in any of the external card readers that I have,
and I had to resort to a USB cable to transfer photos from
the camera to my other computers.</p>

which is initially what I thought the problem was.
On looking more closely at the cards, I see that they're the newer SDHC cards.

<p>Senator Patty Murray visited us at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cozi.com/">Cozi</a> this morning.
She was there to hear from small business people about healthcare reform
and she met with half-a-dozen local small business owners,

Barney Frank takes a question from some woman who's comparing Obama to a Nazi

<p>Tommy Flood is another of Chris Moore's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2007/08/29/ReviewADirtyJob.aspx">Beta Males</a>.
He's also a brand-new 19-year-old vampire, newly turned by his girlfriend Jody—her&shy;self only a vampire for a few months.
He's not too keen about his new state, but he's trying to cope.
It doesn't help that his former crew of shelf stockers at Safeway
are trying to hunt his vampire ass.
And he has a 16-year-old Goth chick for a minion who thinks
the Lord Flood is like OMG totally hot.</p>
<p>Funny but not mean-spirited.</p>

<p>When using Lightroom before, I was never able to figure out how
to move photos from one folder to another.
You'd think that you could just click on a photo and drag it.
I just spent twenty minutes figuring out what I've been doing wrong.
After you've selected multiple photos,
click on the <em>photo thumbnail</em> and <em>not</em> the sur&shy;round&shy;ing gray frame,
and then you can drag the photos to the target folder.</p>
<p>I had become accustomed to clicking on the frames to multi-select photos,
so naturally I assumed that was also how you dragged a set of photos.
But clicking on a frame of a selected photo merely deselects <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/08/16/MovingPhotosInLightroom.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>The unnamed nar&shy;ra&shy;tor—My name? If I told you that you'd be as clever as me—is an up-and-coming London drug dealer who wants to retire by his thirtieth birthday.
He's pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al, low-key, and a little bit cocky, and he has every chance of pulling it off.
He re&shy;luc&shy;tant&shy;ly does a favor for the crime boss Jimmy Price and
suddenly his plans are derailed.
Double-crosses, snitches, betrayals, murders, hold ups, and stings ensue.
There's little honor among thieves, save for our hero's immediate circle.</p>
