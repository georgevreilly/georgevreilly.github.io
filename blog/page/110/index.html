<p>I hadn&#8217;t really planned to visit Ireland this year, but then my sister
Michelle phoned the other day to say that her boyfriend, David Bowles, had
just proposed to her. Not a big surprise. They had moved in together
earlier this year, and we were all assuming that it was a question of when,
not&nbsp;if.</p>
<p>They plan to get married quite soon, as his father has been given
six-to-nine months to live, and they want him to be at the wedding. I don&#8217;t
know if the date is firm yet, but the latest that I&#8217;m hearing is&nbsp;November-11th.</p>

Only their respective bosses, Su&shy;per&shy;in&shy;ten&shy;dant Wong and Big Sam, know who they are.
Each becomes aware of the other about the same time,

<p>In the 1980s, in order to solidify their shift from divorce to

accepted by most Americans as true. Simply put, the abortion myth is
this: Leaders of the Religious Right would have us believe that their
movement began in direct response to the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Supreme Court&#8217;s 1973

<p>In brief, here&#8217;s some of the highlights of&nbsp;June.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2006.html"></a>
<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2006.html">read the Cyclops chapter of Ulysses</a> on June 16th.
I read a part and I was also the script wrangler and&nbsp;webmaster.</p>
<p>My profile on my Windows <span class="caps">XP</span> laptop got corrupted. I decided that I would
make flatten it and turn it into a dual-boot system. I&#8217;m now on my third
week of running Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake). Quite easy to get going. Not so
easy to get everything that I wanted running on&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>I like my Americano made with 175F water to the top of the &quot;2&quot; oval, with
our standard ten-second stir, and press with no steep time.  Then diluted
1:1 after&nbsp;pressing.</p>
<p>Mark likes his brewed with much hotter water, with a 40 second steep time
and he likes to push all of the water through the press, rather than
diluting aftewards.   His recipe has much more edge (which I might call&nbsp;bitterness).</p>

<p>Gore lays out a compelling case that global climate change is real,

Bill Gates and Will Poole showing FlexGo at WinHEC.
</div><p>Nearly two years ago, I said that I was back at Microsoft,
<a class="reference external" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/george_v_reilly/archive/2004/09/26/234349.aspx">as a contractor</a>.
A year later, I said that I was moving on, because my <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/09/18/JobHunting.html">12 months were up</a>.
In both cases, I said that I was doing some really in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing work and
that I hoped to be able to talk about it some&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>Now the truth can be told: I was working on
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/flexgo/default.mspx">FlexGo</a>,
Microsoft&#8217;s new prepaid/sub&shy;scrip&shy;tion versions of Windows.
FlexGo was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/may06/05-21EmergingMarketConsumersPR.mspx">announced last Monday</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/2006/05-23WinHEC.asp">unveiled the next day at WinHEC</a>
(transcript of BillG&#8217;s speech; FlexGo is at the end).
