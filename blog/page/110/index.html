<p>I spent far too much time on Friday trying to make <a class="reference external" href="https://logging.apache.org/log4net/">log4net</a> work in a <span class="caps">COM</span>+ ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
<p>Someone else had done part of the work necessary,
by creating an <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/florinlazar/archive/2003/12/04/41369.aspx">ap­pli­ca­tion.config</a> for the <span class="caps">COM</span>+ ap­pli­ca­tion
and setting a custom Ap­pli­ca­tion Root Directory.
This was enough to ensure that most of the managed code in the ap­pli­ca­tion
got their con­fig­u­ra­tion settings;
log4net being the exception.</p>
<p>It took some additional work to realize that we needed to add two assembly attributes:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[assembly: log4net.Config.Repository("unique-name")]
[assembly: log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator(ConfigFile="application.config")]
</pre>
<p>The repository name just needs to be a unique string.
We used the name of the assembly.</p>

    <p>From Scott Hanselman,
I learned about Mi­crosoft­’s new blog posting client, <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/08/18/PostingToDasBlogWithWindowsLiveWriter.html/http%3a%2f%2fwww.hanselman.com%2fblog%2fWindowsLiveWriterAndDasBlog19.aspx">Windows Live Writer</a>.
I’ve played around with it and it’s definitely the nicest free blogging client that I’ve used.</p>
<p>Here are in­struc­tions on con­fig­ur­ing it to post to dasBlog.
I’m showing how to set it up for <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/08/18/PostingToDasBlogWithWindowsLiveWriter.html/http%3a%2f%2fwww.emmabart.com%2fMeanderings%2f">Emma’s blog</a>, since she’s running dasBlog 1.8.
I’m running a recent build of the as-yet unreleased dasBlog 1.9,
which supports Really Simple Discovery,
which makes the first part of this exercise simpler,
as <span class="caps">WLW</span> can infer that it’s dealing with Metaweblog <span class="caps">API</span>,
just by pointing it at the root of the blog.</p>
<p>Launch <span class="caps">WLW</span> and Add a Weblog Account.
Choose Another weblog service.</p>

<p>This year is the 20th an­niver­sary of the Northwest <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Walk.
A whole generation has passed.
Twenty years ago, <span class="caps">AIDS</span> was considered a gay man’s disease and a death sentence.
The <span class="caps">U.S.</span> government was just beginning to ac­knowl­edge the existence of <span class="caps">AIDS</span>,
half a decade after it had first been recognized by health au­thor­i­ties,
and thousands had died.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AIDS</span> is still a serious problem,
but the de­vel­op­ment of an­ti­retro­vi­ral drugs a decade ago
means that people with <span class="caps">HIV</span> are living longer,

More than 1 million Americans are now living with <span class="caps">HIV</span>/<span class="caps">AIDS</span>:
9,000 of them in King County.

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Alinsky">Saul Alinsky</a>

He moved from labor organizing to social organizing in the late 1930s,
working in the Back of the Yards neigh­bor­hood of Chicago that was made
famous by Upton Sinclair in <em>The Jungle</em>. He is generally considered the
father of community organizing.</p>

    <p>My brother David sent me this photo earlier today, of
me, him, and Michelle. I’m guessing that Michelle is less than a year old,
so it was taken sometime in 1971, which would make David four and me six.
(Our youngest brother, Mark, wasn’t born until 1973.)</p>

<p>Emma thinks we’re adorable and has already made this picture her desktop
background on her work computer.</p>
<p>Mark has another photo of the four of us, taken in 1978

<p>Joe Lieberman, the 2000 vice-pres­i­den­tial nominee, lost the Democratic primary
for his Senate seat tonight. He has said that he will run as an in­de­pen­dent.
In effect, he will not accept the will of the people.</p>
<p>Lieberman lost, in part, because of his continuing refusal to admit that
the Iraq war is a disaster, and in part because he has been a leading
enabler of the Republican agenda. Good riddance!</p>

Lamont and that they strip Lieberman of his Senate committees.</p>
