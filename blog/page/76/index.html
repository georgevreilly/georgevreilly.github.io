Old Mr. Carswell is a domestic tyrant and the former business partner of Mr. Frant.
Frant swindles his own bank and is found murdered;

<p>I’ve appointed myself as Frank’s <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/07/FrankRAJMaloney19452009.html">electronic executor</a>.
He had an active online life,
spending over 20 years in Usenet newsgroups
and selling hundreds of pieces of vintage costume jewelry on eBay.</p>
<p>We had a dry run for this in October, after he’d been in hospital for a month.
The need to deal with his eBay customers had grown pressing.
Lyndol is not tech­ni­cal­ly savvy and was unable to handle it.
I had to work out how to get into his eBay, PayPal, and email accounts.
For­tu­nate­ly, I was able to phone Frank in the hospital and ask him.
Un­for­tu­nate­ly, he had forgotten many of the passwords
and I had to use <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/01/12/DontLeaveAMess.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Terry Pratchett was diagnosed with a rare form of early onset Alzheimer’s in 2007.
For­tu­nate­ly, it’s not evident in this <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.lspace.org/">Discworld</a> book.</p>
<p>Moist von Lipwig, con man ex­tra­or­di­naire, finds himself in charge
of the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork and the Royal Mint.
The people don’t trust the banks much.
In an effort to get money flowing, he introduces paper money to Ankh-Morpork.
Lipwig, like his creator, is an acute observer of people,
and pulls it off against the odds.</p>
<p>Pratchett does his usual trick of holding a fun-house mirror

<p>On Wednesday, I ac­com­pa­nied Lyn to the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.funerals.coop/">People’s Memorial Funeral Co­op­er­a­tive</a>
on Capitol Hill to make the arrange­ment for Frank’s cremation.</p>
<p>Years ago, I read Jessica Mitford’s
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mitford.org/rev.htm">The American Way of Death Revisited</a>
and it left me with an even lower opinion
of the funeral industry than I already had.</p>
<p>I had never made any funeral arrange­ments before.
It turned out to be both painless and in­ex­pen­sive.
The funeral director sat down with us and gathered in­for­ma­tion
for the death cer­tifi­cate that the doctor was unable to provide,
such as parents’ names and other personal details.
Initially, we put down “Software Doc­u­menter” as Frank’s oc­cu­pa­tion—his
final job had been a ten-year stint at Microsoft as <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/01/10/Funerals.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>My nephew’s name is Harold Mark Bowles, to be known as Harry.
I assume the Mark is after my brother.
No idea about the Harold/Harry.</p>
<p>I said <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2008/12/14/NewBabies.html">before</a> that my mother was very excited at becoming a grand­moth­er.
Here’s the proof: take a look at the huge smile on her face.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, she was trying to decide what her new title was to be.
She was really pleased at becoming a granny,
but not at all eager to be known as “Granny”.
She tried out “Nan Et” (Et for Ethna), which we promptly turned into “Nanette”.
“Gran Et” was even worse: with a strong Dublin accent it becomes “Granite”.

<p>I wrote <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2008/12/17/ToFrankAndLyndol.html">three weeks ago</a>, that Frank’s time was limited.
He died yesterday at 3am of liver failure.
He had been un­con­scious since Saturday,
and he had been moved to a hospital bed in his living room on Thursday.</p>
<p>I was at a coffee shop near work yesterday morning
when Emma called me to relay the news from Lyndol.
We hurried over there and spent the rest of the day with him,
helping out as various friends came over.</p>
<p>Lyn is doing as well as can be expected.
He’s sad, oc­ca­sion­al­ly weepy, and sometimes a little manic.
I think he’s relieved that Frank’s ordeal is over.

<p>At 12:44am Monday (Irish Time), Michelle gave birth to a 9lb 8oz boy.
Mother and son are healthy but exhausted.
I’m not sure quite how long the actual labor lasted;
but I think she started late on Saturday.</p>
<p>My nephew is, as yet, unnamed.
David and Michelle have yet to find a boy’s name that both of them really like.
Under Irish law, they have three months to do so,
but Michelle hopes to pick a name within a few days at most.</p>
<p>[Update: they named him Harry.]</p>

<p>Rozan weaves together two stories here, past and present.</p>
<p>Seven children, four boys and three girls,
grow up together on Staten Island in the 1960s and 70s.
In early adulthood, one of the young men ac­ci­den­tal­ly kills another,
then is killed in prison.
A third boy, Jimmy McCaffrey, becomes estranged from the others
and moves to Manhattan where he rises in the Fire Department.</p>
<p>Jimmy dies in the Twin Towers on 9/11,
doing what he did best: saving people.
A month later, a washed-up newspaper reporter writes a story

The focus has switched to a younger set of characters,
the first generation to grow up after the “Change”,
the event that knocked the world back into the Dark Ages.</p>
<p>A traveler arrives in Oregon from the East, bearing a compelling prophecy that
requires Rudi Mackenzie to travel to Nantucket, the apparent source of the Change.
