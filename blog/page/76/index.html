<p>Eric had the temerity last week to <a class="reference external" href="http://offby1-whining.blogspot.com/2008/12/pentaho.html">gripe</a> on his blog
about a certain open source business in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gence product,
and got swarmed by irate defenders.
Apparently he showed up in their Google Alerts.
Some of the posters were helpful,
but the <em>ad hominem</em> attackers were more&nbsp;en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing:</p>
<blockquote>
Your blog has had 22 posts in the past year, and your blogroll includes
absolutely no one of note in the open source world. So I think it’s

I said that it was the first in a series of daily posts for <a class="reference external" href="http://nablopomo.ning.com/">NaBloPoMo</a>,
the National Blog Posting Month, which I had just found out&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>Here I am a month later, having posted something every single evening.
I covered humor; movie and book reviews; being the #1 tech blog (now #2);
politics; Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing; food; personal stuff; and even some technical posts.&nbsp;Whew!</p>
<p>Why bother? As with the two-year-old exercise in book reviews,
it was a personal challenge to come up with a post every single evening

<p>We saw a production of David Sedaris&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattlepublictheater.org/events-santaland.htm">Santaland Diaries</a>
at the Bathhouse Theater tonight. Funny&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we walked over to the Greenlake Bluwater Restaurant
to get a spot of dinner.
We both ordered Tuscan White Bean soup for a starter,
Emma had the Turkey Pot Pie,
and mine was the&nbsp;Fettucine.</p>
<p>The soup was fine and my fettucine was okay.
Emma&#8217;s pot pie had problems.
The potatoes were raw and it had a funny lemony aftertaste.
She pushed the plate away and waited for the waitress to come by.
The waitress apologized and brought Emma the menu.
Emma opted for the meatloaf, since that would come quickly.
The manager apologized and offered us a <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/07/CantTakeHerAnywhere.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

Department of Ex&shy;tra&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nary Affairs in New York City,
in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gates the death of a beautiful ghost
and the apparently re&shy;spectable cultists at the

He has the gift (or curse) of psy&shy;chom&shy;e&shy;try:
when he touches something,
he can divine its&nbsp;history.</p>
<p>This book wobbles between not very black comedy
and straight urban fantasy,
and doesn&#8217;t really succeed as&nbsp;either.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t, as a rule, pay a great deal of attention to Canadian politics.
I was vaguely aware that something unusual is going on there this week.
Then Emma pointed me to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yarnharlot.ca/blog/archives/2008/12/03/what_is_happening_in_canada.html">Yarn Harlot</a>&#8216;s ex&shy;pla&shy;na&shy;tion
of what&#8217;s&nbsp;happened.</p>
<p>In brief, for the last two years,
Stephen Harper&#8217;s minority government has been playing
a high-stakes game, repeatedly forcing the opposition parties
to either vote with him or force an election, which they
would likely&nbsp;lose.</p>
<p>Last week, as soon as Parliament resumed after October&#8217;s general election,
Harper put forth an &quot;economic strategy&quot;, which included removing
federal election subsidies to all par&shy;ties—&shy;ef&shy;fec&shy;tive&shy;ly hobbling the opposition.
The opposition were deeply unhappy about that,

<p>Emma worked at WaMu as a software tester for three years.
I&#8217;m sure that if she were still there, she&#8217;d be one of them.

<p>I look out the window.
Driz&shy;zling—not too heavy—I&#8217;ll ride to work.
Pack my clothes into the panier bag.
Spandex tights, coat, yellow jacket, helmet, gloves: on they go.
Bike&#8217;s in the garage, seems okay, slap on the bag.
Pull it out, reset the odometer.
17 minutes&nbsp;today?</p>
<p>Ignite the blinky lights, pull away.
Down the side roads, until I&#8217;m compelled to take the arterial.
Press the crosswalk button, wait for a break in the traffic.
Two minutes, three, does this fucking light <em>ever</em> change?
Off like a shot, past Jefferson Park.
Maybe they&#8217;ll finish by next summer.
Hit the next light at 2:30.
A long, gentle uphill for the next 8 minutes.

<p>There&#8217;s little that I miss about Irish cooking.
One notable exception is Brown Bread aka Brown Soda Bread.
I don&#8217;t know of any bakery that makes it in the States,
though I&#8217;ve found it at a couple of Irish pubs.
The main difficulty in making it is
finding the coarse-ground wholemeal flour.
The usual fine-ground stuff has the wrong&nbsp;texture.</p>
<p>I know of only one place in the Seattle area that carries
the right flour and that&#8217;s
The Grainery, 13629 1st Ave S, Burien, <span class="caps">WA</span> 98168; (206) 244-5015.
I bought some flour there today,
made a loaf, and brought the loaf and a 10lb bag of flour
to an Irish friend&#8217;s birthday&nbsp;party.</p>
