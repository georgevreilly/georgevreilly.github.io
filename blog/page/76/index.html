<p>I made <a class="reference external" href="http://www.joyofbaking.com/RoyalIcing.html">royal icing</a> last night for the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/01/05/ChristmasCake.html">Christmas Cake</a>
to put over the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/22/Marzipan.html">marzipan</a>.
A very tedious half hour with an electric handheld mixer
to beat the egg whites until they were stiff,
and then beat in the powdered&nbsp;sugar.</p>
<p>The recipe that I used from an old <em>Joy of Cooking</em>
called for the juice of 1 lemon.
I used <a class="reference external" href="http://www.drpeppersnapplegroup.com/brands/realemon/">ReaLemon</a> which says that 3 ta&shy;ble&shy;spoons = 1 lemon.
I added two ta&shy;ble&shy;spoons, which was quite lemony.
The recipe that I&#8217;ve linked to calls for two teaspoons,
which seems like a better&nbsp;choice.</p>
<p>I had drizzled whiskey over the cake several times to keep it moist.
That was a mistake.
The cake turned out <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/01/26/ChristmasCakeRoyalIcing.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I mentioned <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/05/20/FogIsMyCopilot.html">Copilot</a> a while back as a way of helping someone
by connecting remotely to their&nbsp;desktop.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.crossloop.com/">CrossLoop</a> is another such service.
If you want to charge someone for helping them out,
CrossLoop will take a cut.
Otherwise, unlike Copilot, it&#8217;s completely free.
Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, it&#8217;s Windows only:
there&#8217;s no Mac or Linux&nbsp;clients.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used it a couple of times to connect to my parents&#8217; computers
in Dublin and Cape Town.
It works well, though it&#8217;s still painfully&nbsp;slow.</p>
<p>This morning&#8217;s problem:
My father was no longer seeing images in his Yahoo mail.
Somehow, he had managed in Firefox to block images
on his Yahoo mail server,
and only on his Yahoo mail&nbsp;server.</p>

<p>Their service is wretched.
That line moves at a glacial pace.
I&#8217;ve never taken less than 20 minutes to get a sandwich;
sometimes twice that.
The staff are slow and in&shy;ef&shy;fi&shy;cient.
Their stations are badly laid out

<p>For several years, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> has been my default browser.
Firefox&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">extensions</a> have always been its paramount feature for me,
but its per&shy;for&shy;mance and developer tools came close.
I&#8217;m very happy with it, for the most&nbsp;part.</p>
<p>The one thing that makes me unhappy is Firefox 3&#8217;s <span class="caps">CPU</span> con&shy;sump&shy;tion.
Time and again, I find it running at close to full uti&shy;liza&shy;tion of one <span class="caps">CPU</span> core
on my MacBook Pro.
The tipoff is usually the warmth of the metal case.
Killing the Gmail tab tends to help, but not enough.
In Firefox 2, the worst problem was the memory leaks.
Within hours, it would have chewed up several hundred megabytes.
Memory usage is better <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/01/22/UsingOpera.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I made my <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/01/05/ChristmasCake.html">Christmas Cake</a> back in November,
but am only now getting around to putting on the icing.
I&#8217;ve kept it moist with several ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions of&nbsp;whiskey.</p>
<p>Last year, I made <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzipan">marzipan</a> from scratch.
Never again!
It was a huge amount of work to blanch the almonds
and the stiff mixture of sugar and almonds caused the
food processor to seize up more than&nbsp;once.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t use up all the marzipan that I made that time.
I put the remainder into a sealed container,
placed it in the fridge, and forgot all about it.
When I took it out of the fridge yesterday,
it was still good.
Oh, the top half-inch had hardened

‘Our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784">Long National Nightmare</a> Of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over’.
How&nbsp;prophetic!</p>
<p>Finally, the long national nightmare of the George W. Bush presidency is&nbsp;over.</p>
<p>Barack Obama took the oath of office today.
His <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/us/politics/20text-obama.html?pagewanted=all">inaugural speech</a> was somber, reasoned, cautionary, and
in&shy;spi&shy;ra&shy;tional—of a piece with the&nbsp;man.</p>
<p>He faces enormous dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ties.
There are enormous op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ties too, if he can but seize them.
The polls say that the American people do not expect overnight miracles.
I hope we will all remember that a year from&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to Obama and his&nbsp;presidency.</p>

    <p>Twenty years ago tomorrow, I attended <a class="reference external" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DA1538F932A15752C0A96F948260">Bush Senior&#8217;s In&shy;au&shy;gu&shy;ra&shy;tion</a>.
By&nbsp;accident.</p>
<p>I was on my first solo trip to the United States,
having arrived in New York the previous week.
There I had purchased a 30-day unlimited standby ticket with Delta.
It cost me only $400, as I could produce my round-the-world&nbsp;ticket.</p>
<p>For no par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly good reason, I decided to start
the 30 days with a trip to Washington <span class="caps">DC</span>.
There were museums there and it was&nbsp;nearby.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t been paying close attention to the news, and
it was only when I got to Washington that I realized that
George <span class="caps">H.W.</span> Bush&#8217;s in&shy;au&shy;gu&shy;ra&shy;tion was to be be held the next day.

<p>Milk was a middle-aged closet case who moved to San Francisco in the early 1970s,
became po&shy;lit&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly active, and started running for office,
un&shy;suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly at first.
“The Mayor of Castro Street” was elected to the San Francisco Board of
Su&shy;per&shy;vi&shy;sors in 1977,
the first openly gay man to hold public office in the United States.
A year later, only days after the anti-gay Cal&shy;i&shy;forn&shy;ian ballot initiative,
Propo&shy;si&shy;tion 6, went down to defeat,
Milk and Mayor George Moscone were murdered by ex-Supervisor Dan&nbsp;White.</p>

<p>Last Sunday President-elect Barack Obama was asked whether he would seek an
in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion of possible crimes by the Bush ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion. “I don’t
believe that anybody is above the law,” he responded, but “we need to look
forward as opposed to looking&nbsp;backwards.”</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but if we don’t have an inquest into what happened during the
Bush years — and nearly everyone has taken Mr. Obama’s remarks to mean that
we won’t — this means that those who hold power are indeed above the law
because they don’t face any con&shy;se&shy;quences if they abuse their&nbsp;power.</p>
