<p>I mentioned <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/17/Closing39Route.html">recently</a> that the #39 route is closing,
which would leave me without a direct connection to downtown Seattle.
The new #50 route would run along 15th Ave S, two blocks from my house,
to the Lander St Light Rail station in&nbsp;SoDo.</p>
<p>We attended the Metro Open House at the Jefferson Community Center this&nbsp;evening.</p>
<p>My concerns are slightly assuaged.
The new #50 should run every 15 minutes and run until about 11pm.
That&#8217;s better than the #39 which runs every 30 minutes until 7pm,
then hourly until&nbsp;9pm.</p>
<p>In addition, the #60, which also travels along 15th and
goes past the Beacon Hill Light Rail station,
would run later and longer, <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/01/28/MetroOpenHouse.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

Pope Benedict <span class="caps">XVI</span>, reaching out to the far-right of the Roman Catholic Church,
revoked the ex&shy;com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tions of four schismatic bishops on Saturday,

A very tedious half hour with an electric handheld mixer

<p>The recipe that I used from an old Joy of Cooking called for the juice of 1 lemon.
I used ReaLemon which says that 3 ta&shy;ble&shy;spoons = 1 lemon.
I added two ta&shy;ble&shy;spoons, which was quite lemony.
The recipe that I&#8217;ve linked to calls for two teaspoons, which seems like a better&nbsp;choice.</p>

<p>I mentioned <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/05/20/FogIsMyCopilot.html">Copilot</a> a while back as a way of helping someone
by connecting remotely to their&nbsp;desktop.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.crossloop.com/">CrossLoop</a> is another such service.
If you want to charge someone for helping them out,
CrossLoop will take a cut.
Otherwise, unlike Copilot, it&#8217;s completely free.
Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, it&#8217;s Windows only:
there&#8217;s no Mac or Linux&nbsp;clients.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used it a couple of times to connect to my parents&#8217; computers
in Dublin and Cape Town.
It works well, though it&#8217;s still painfully&nbsp;slow.</p>
<p>This morning&#8217;s problem:
My father was no longer seeing images in his Yahoo mail.
Somehow, he had managed in Firefox to block images
on his Yahoo mail server,
and only on his Yahoo mail&nbsp;server.</p>

<p>For several years, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> has been my default browser.
Firefox&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">extensions</a> have always been its paramount feature for me,
but its per&shy;for&shy;mance and developer tools came close.
I&#8217;m very happy with it, for the most&nbsp;part.</p>
<p>The one thing that makes me unhappy is Firefox 3&#8217;s <span class="caps">CPU</span> con&shy;sump&shy;tion.
Time and again, I find it running at close to full uti&shy;liza&shy;tion of one <span class="caps">CPU</span> core
on my MacBook Pro.
The tipoff is usually the warmth of the metal case.
Killing the Gmail tab tends to help, but not enough.
In Firefox 2, the worst problem was the memory leaks.
Within hours, it would have chewed up several hundred megabytes.

<p>I made my <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/01/05/ChristmasCake.html">Christmas Cake</a> back in November,
but am only now getting around to putting on the icing.
I&#8217;ve kept it moist with several ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions of&nbsp;whiskey.</p>
<p>Last year, I made <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzipan">marzipan</a> from scratch.
Never again!
It was a huge amount of work to blanch the almonds
and the stiff mixture of sugar and almonds caused the
food processor to seize up more than&nbsp;once.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t use up all the marzipan that I made that time.
I put the remainder into a sealed container,
placed it in the fridge, and forgot all about it.
When I took it out of the fridge yesterday,
it was still good.
Oh, the top half-inch had hardened

How&nbsp;prophetic!</p>
<p>Finally, the long national nightmare of the George W. Bush presidency is&nbsp;over.</p>
<p>Barack Obama took the oath of office today.
His <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/us/politics/20text-obama.html?pagewanted=all">inaugural speech</a> was somber, reasoned, cautionary, and
in&shy;spi&shy;ra&shy;tional—of a piece with the&nbsp;man.</p>
<p>He faces enormous dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ties.
There are enormous op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ties too, if he can but seize them.
The polls say that the American people do not expect overnight miracles.
I hope we will all remember that a year from&nbsp;now.</p>

By&nbsp;accident.</p>
<p>I was on my first solo trip to the United States,
having arrived in New York the previous week.
There I had purchased a 30-day unlimited standby ticket with Delta.
It cost me only $400, as I could produce my round-the-world&nbsp;ticket.</p>
<p>For no par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly good reason, I decided to start
the 30 days with a trip to Washington <span class="caps">DC</span>.
There were museums there and it was&nbsp;nearby.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t been paying close attention to the news, and
it was only when I got to Washington that I realized that
George <span class="caps">H.W.</span> Bush&#8217;s in&shy;au&shy;gu&shy;ra&shy;tion was to be be held the next day.
