    <p>At this month&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/">PuPPy (Puget Sound Pro&shy;gram&shy;ming Python) Meetup</a>,
I heard a brief mention of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/">Python f-strings</a>
as a new feature coming in Python&nbsp;3.6.</p>
<p>In essence, they offer a simpler, more versatile method
of string formatting and in&shy;ter&shy;po&shy;la&shy;tion
over existing methods.
F-strings can include not only symbol names
but Python <em>ex&shy;pres&shy;sions</em> within strings.
With <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings">str.format</a>, you can write
<tt class="docutils literal">'Hello, <span class="pre">{name}'.format(name=some_name)</span></tt>.
You can control various aspects of how <tt class="docutils literal">name</tt> is formatted,
such as being centered within a field—see <a class="reference external" href="https://pyformat.info/">PyFormat</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://mkaz.github.io/2012/10/10/python-string-format/">Python String Format Cookbook</a>
for ex&shy;am&shy;ples—but no more complex expression is allowed between the&nbsp;braces.</p>
<p>Herewith some examples of f-string ex&shy;pres&shy;sions
drawn from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/"><span class="caps">PEP</span> 0498</a>:</p>

<p>For the CookBrite holiday party this evening,
we selected recipes from the CookBrite app
and cooked them for each&nbsp;other.</p>
<p>We had a lot of good food.
I par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly enjoyed making and drinking these&nbsp;milkshakes.</p>
<div class="section" id="ingredients">

<p>It seems old-fashioned to do so,
but I still like to send and to receive Christmas cards.
We wrote <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2015/12/06/ChristmasPudding.html">30 cards</a> last weekend.
Almost all were <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/malki/multi-purpose-all-occasion-greeting-cards">Wondermark Multi-Purpose Greeting Cards</a>,
from a Kick&shy;starter that Emma con&shy;tributed to a few months&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p>Speaking of Kick&shy;starters,
<a class="reference external" href="http://nerdist.com/pickstarter-shakespeare-fights-crime-like-batman-in-no-holds-bard/">No Holds Bard</a> showed up in my Facebook feed today.
I was so tickled by the concept that I anted up $10.
I&#8217;ve read several novels where Will Shake&shy;speare was a character,
such as <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/07/26/ReviewInkAndSteel.html">Ink and Steel</a> and <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2015/03/07/ReviewRevenger.html">Revenger</a>,
but never a comic book where he was a&nbsp;superhero.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we started receiving cards from other people.
A couple of dozen more will&nbsp;follow.</p>

    <p>Two weeks ago, we painted the kitchen blue.
A deeper blue than I had intended.
It had more than a little bit of the Greek taverna about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Today, we started work on the &quot;bar room&quot;,
the room between the kitchen and the back yard,
where we keep the booze.
No painting yet.
We&#8217;ve taken everything out of that room and cleaned.
Fifteen years of cobwebs have been removed from behind the book&nbsp;cases.</p>
<p>Soon, a lighter&nbsp;blue.</p>

<p>Tom Hardy has had a very good year,
starring in <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> and
playing both Reggie and Ronnie Kray in
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_(2015_film)">Legend</a>.</p>
<p><em>Legend</em> loving recreates London in the Swinging Sixties
when the Kray twins were not only notorious gangsters but also celebri&shy;ties,
mingling with the rich and famous in their nightclubs.
Reggie is portrayed as the smarter, charming, and stable brother;
Ronnie as erratic and psy&shy;cho&shy;pathic;
both are capable of great violence.
The film is narrated from beyond the grave by Reggie&#8217;s wife, Frances,
and con&shy;cen&shy;trates mostly on Reggie.
Hardy is excellent as Reggie, but hard to understand as Ronnie,
while Emily Browning does a fine job as the young wife who&#8217;s <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2015/12/11/ReviewLegend.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>We have three non-tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al Christmas movies
that we watch almost every December,
<a class="reference external" href="http://diehard.wikia.com/wiki/Die_Hard">Die Hard</a>,

and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ref">The Ref</a>.</p>
<p>Die Hards 1 and 2 are the best in the series.
Although they seemed wildly over the top when they were made (1988 and 1990),
they seem un&shy;der&shy;stat&shy;ed compared to the thrillers that Hollywood pumps out&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>We saw Die Hard again tonight.
Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman shine in their breakout roles.
Willis exhibits the trademark cockiness that was already familiar
from <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlighting_(TV_series)">Moon&shy;light&shy;ing</a>,
but he&#8217;s not as obnoxious as he often was in later roles.
Rickman gently nibbles the scenery as a terrorist turned master&nbsp;criminal.</p>

<p>Emma&#8217;s been com&shy;plain&shy;ing for some time that <span class="caps">USB</span> devices only worked in one port
on her Lenovo E545 laptop.
The <span class="caps">USB</span> 2 port worked;
the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_3.0"><span class="caps">USB</span> 3</a> ports&nbsp;didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I took a look at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.howtogeek.com/167094/how-to-use-the-windows-device-manager-for-troubleshooting/">Device Manager</a>,
and I noticed that most of the <span class="caps">USB</span> nodes looked wrong.
She went to the Lenovo website and downloaded two <span class="caps">USB</span>-related drivers,
the <span class="caps">AMD</span> <span class="caps">USB</span> Filter Driver and the <span class="caps">AMD</span> <span class="caps">USB</span> 3.0 Driver.
Between them, they fixed the problem and she now has all ports&nbsp;working.</p>
<p>This machine is running Windows 7.
At some point, she wiped the machine to get rid of Lenovo crapware,
and installed a clean copy of Windows 7.

<p>Burke Devore is a middle-aged middle manager at a paper mill,
who&#8217;s been laid off for some time.
There are too many others like him
and they&#8217;re beating him out for the few positions in his field.
In des&shy;per&shy;a&shy;tion, he decides to eliminate the com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion
by placing a fake job ad&shy;ver&shy;tise&shy;ment for others with similar skills
