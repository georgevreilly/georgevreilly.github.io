<p>We saw <em>The Seafarer</em> at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattlereptickets.org/Plays/0809/SF/">Seattle Rep</a> this afternoon.
Two brothers, Richard and Sharkey, share a house in north Dublin.
There's little love lost between them.
Richard, recently blinded, is con&shy;trol&shy;ling and wheedling.
Sharkey is trying to stay off the gargle
and it's not easy when Richard and his crony Ivan drink like fishes.</p>
<p>Sharkey's old rival, Nicky, arrives on Christmas Eve,
bringing a stranger with him, Mr. Lockhart.
They settle down to a game of poker
and Sharkey privately learns that he's met the stranger once before.
For Mr. Lockhart is the devil and he wants to collect the old debt
that Sharkey owes <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/09/ReviewTheSeafarer.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>As promised <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/03/06/WhoWatchesTheWatchmen.html">yesterday</a>, we saw the initial midnight showing
of the <em>Watchmen</em> movie at the Pacific Science Center IMAX.
And, lo, the geeks came in their numbers
and they were greatly pleased.
Some were dressed as Rorschach,
one came as a smurf;
no, I lie, he was Dr. Manhattan.</p>
<p>I summarized the plot in my review of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/02/22/ReviewWatchmenBook.html">book</a>.
That still holds: the movie was largely faithful to the book.
In many scenes, it was clear that the book had served as a storyboard.
Too faithful in some ways at 165 minutes long.
Some subplots were elim&shy;i&shy;nat&shy;ed;
no doubt they will resurface <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/06/ReviewWatchmenFilm.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Answer: we do.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(film)">Watchmen movie</a>, that is.
Peter, Carol, Raven, Iain, Emma, and I are all going to see
the midnight initial showing at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pacsci.org/imax/">Pacific Science Center IMAX</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that I've ever been geeky enough to watch
the midnight opening of a movie before.
But it was Peter's idea.</p>
<p>Peter and I shared an apartment in 1990–92 when we were both grad students at Brown,
and it was his copy of <em>Watchmen</em> that I first read.</p>
<p>And so the loop closes.</p>

<p>I knew three of my grand&shy;par&shy;ents; they all died after I reached adulthood.
My mother's father, George Victor Clery, died 12 days before I was born,
on March 3rd, 1965.
I was to be named Vincent after my father, [Charles] Vincent Reilly.
Instead, I was christened George Vincent Reilly.
I was the first grandchild for both the Clerys and the Reillys.
I think I must have been a welcome dis&shy;trac&shy;tion.</p>
<p>Ironically, my parents had gotten married on his birthday,
March 30th, the previous year,
and he didn't live to celebrate their first an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
The timing was partly in his honor
and partly because it was Easter Monday.

<p>At lunch today, I told Eric about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec03/tech/full_papers/crosby/crosby.pdf">Hash Attacks</a>:
for many hash functions,
it's possible to construct a large set of keys that collide.
This can be used to cause a Denial of Service
as hashtable operations can be induced
to take <em>O(n)</em> time instead of <em>O(1)</em>.</p>
<p>Crosby and Wallach suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly <a class="reference external" href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec03/tech/full_papers/crosby/crosby.pdf">demon&shy;strat&shy;ed</a> this
against a number of ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions.</p>
<p>Andrew has a good writeup of <a class="reference external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120318203841/http://www.team5150.com/~andrew/blog/2007/03/hash_algorithm_attacks.html">Hash Algorithm Attacks</a>.</p>
<p>There are various mit&shy;i&shy;ga&shy;tions suggested.
The one that I used when I first became aware of this problem
is to use a salt to the hash function.</p>
<p>In other words, change:</p>

<pre class="brush: C">
unsigned hash(const char* s)
{
    unsigned h = 0;

<p>One thing that's been bugging me since I started using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/01/22/UsingOpera.aspx">Opera</a>
is that <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text was showing as normal text in my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/">personal blog</a>.
Yet other browsers were correctly displaying bold and italic on my blog.</p>
<p>I'm still not entirely sure why Mac Opera had a problem with it,
but I fixed it by using the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brownbatterystudios.com/sixthings/2007/03/14/lucida-hybrid-the-grande-alternative/">Lucida Hybrid</a> stylesheet tweak.</p>
<p>I adjusted a few other things while I was at it.
The most obvious is that the font size is larger.</p>
<p>Most RSS readers won't pick up the stylesheet,
so take a look at the actual <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/">blog</a>.</p>

<p>Esther Schindler has a post about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.javaworld.com/community/node/2500">in&shy;ter&shy;view&shy;ing your next boss</a>:
should a candidate dev manager meet everyone who'll be reporting to them?</p>
<p>Yes. Definitely.
If you want a successful, cohesive team,
there has to be trust.
A manager can make or break a team.</p>
<p>A new manager starts at a dis&shy;ad&shy;van&shy;tage,
relative to a new individual con&shy;trib&shy;u&shy;tor.
The new dev is expected to ramp up
and have time to build re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ships with the team.
The new manager has to build the re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ships as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If the manager gets to interview with the team
before being offered the job,
both parties benefit.

<p>Apple launched the public <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=19&amp;entry_id=36185">Safari 4 beta</a> today.</p>
<p>It runs beau&shy;ti&shy;ful&shy;ly on Vista and it's the fastest browser that I've seen,
noticeably faster than Chrome.
Everything that I tried worked fairly well;
I saw only a few minor glitches.</p>
<p>I installed it on my MacBook at home this evening.
It crashes at startup every time that I attempt to run it.
For&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, it comes with an unin&shy;staller so that I could revert to Safari 3.21.</p>

<p>I was Toast&shy;mas&shy;ter of the Day at this evening's meeting of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.FreelySpeaking.org/">Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters</a>.
My theme was software de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment and I wanted to give the non-developer audience
a taste for what it's like to write a program.
I talked about writing a simple Sudoku game.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read <em>Pro&shy;gram&shy;ming Sudoku</em> for background.
I bought this book for Emma after reading about it on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ProgrammingSudoku.aspx">Scott Hansel&shy;man's blog</a>.
It's targeted at beginning pro&shy;gram&shy;mers and
walks them through building a Sudoku game and solver.
