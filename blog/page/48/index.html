<p>It&#8217;s shocking how few times I&#8217;ve crossed the Cascades into Eastern Washington
in the seventeen years that I&#8217;ve lived in Seattle.
We go up or down the I-5 corridor, usually heading for Portland or Vancouver,
or we cross Puget Sound to the Olympic Peninsula.
But we never go more than about 30 miles&nbsp;inland.</p>
<p>We needed a break and we wanted to celebrate our <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/11/07/12thAnniversary.html">12th an&shy;niver&shy;sary</a>.
For once, we decided to head over to Washington&#8217;s wine country.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tricitieswinefestival.com/">Tri-Cities Wine Festival</a> was being held in Kennewick today,
so that was our&nbsp;des&shy;ti&shy;na&shy;tion.</p>

arriving in Kennewick after dark.

<p>Twelve years ago today, Emma and I met face-to-face for the first time.
We had been talking on the phone for about three weeks
after I had answered her personals ad in <em>The Stranger</em>.
We might have met a little sooner,
but she was busy meeting the other guys who had responded,
and I was undergoing the <span class="caps">IIS</span>&nbsp;4 deathmarch at&nbsp;Microsoft.</p>
<p>We were both nervous and we each responded char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;ti&shy;cal&shy;ly.
Emma babbled; I said very little.
She told me later that she thought that she had scared me off.
She hadn&#8217;t, though.
We had already talked several times on the phone and she had been less nervous.
I liked her and I <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/11/07/12thAnniversary.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I&#8217;m fairly confident that Referendum&nbsp;71 will be approved.
It was leading by 51% this morning and by 51.8% this evening,
and leading 2:1 in King County, the most populous, most liberal county in Washington&nbsp;state.</p>
<p>Ballots merely have to be postmarked by Election Day to be valid,
and hundreds of thousands of them have not yet been received by the vote&nbsp;counters.</p>
<p>I attended the Election Night party last night
and helped the tech team with some behind-the-scenes arrange&shy;ments.
In the photo, Joe Mirabella (lead blogger) and Josh Cohen (tech lead)

<p>Sonchai Jit&shy;pleecheep is a devout Buddhist, half Thai and half American,
and one of the few Bangkok cops who is not on the take.
An American marine is murdered grotesque&shy;ly
in a manner that ac&shy;ci&shy;den&shy;tal&shy;ly kills Sonchai&#8217;s partner and soul brother.
Sonchai must help the <span class="caps">FBI</span> in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gate and seek his own revenge.
The trail takes them through the foulest gutters and the palaces of the wealthy.
We encounter pros&shy;ti&shy;tutes, monks, shemales, jade collectors, and gangsters
in a tour of the Thailand that most Westerners barely&nbsp;glimpse.</p>

<p>When we moved to Beacon Hill in 2000,
we were totally dumb&shy;found&shy;ed by the number of kids
who came trick-or-treating to our door.
In the prior two years, we had been renting a house in Walling&shy;ford,
and we had only had one set of kids each&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>We had about 100 kids that first year.
We were not expecting the onslaught and ran out of candy,
which led to Emma being berated by some pre&shy;sump&shy;tu&shy;ous mother.
We live in a relatively affluent block
and kids are brought quite a distance to partake of the goodies.
One small boy peered up at Emma once and asked her, “Are you&nbsp;rich?”</p>

<p>I saw Greenstage&#8217;s production of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.greenstage.org/2009/titus">Titus Andronicus</a> on Sunday night.
Normally, this is Shake&shy;speare&#8217;s bloodiest tragedy,
but Greenstage chose to play it as a dark comedy.
It&#8217;s still bloody, extremely bloody, blood everywhere,
spurting from severed wrists,
spraying from cut throats,
shooting over the stage
(and some of the&nbsp;audience).</p>
<p>The first twenty minutes were very confusing.
The actors spoke their lines very quickly and I had a hard time
tuning in to what they were saying and what was happening.
Then either they slowed down or I tuned in,
but it started making sense,
inasmuch as Titus Andronicus can ever make&nbsp;sense.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen Greenstage do comedies and straight tragedies.
Here they hammed it up,

<p>I spent last Wednesday at Benaroya Hall,
attending the Seattle edition of Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow&#8217;s traveling <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-developer-days-conference/">DevDays conference</a>.
It was well worth&nbsp;$99.</p>
<p>Joel Spolsky, owner of FogCreek Software and co-founder of Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow,
opened the conference with a keynote about the
dichotomy of power and simplicity.
People are happier when not over&shy;whelmed with choices.
Many of the choices that software forces users to make
are es&shy;sen&shy;tial&shy;ly mean&shy;ing&shy;less to the users.
However, even though people want simplicity, they also want features
and different people use different features.
Powerful software sells more&nbsp;copies.</p>
<p>He argues that developers and designers should put in the extra work to make good choices
on behalf of the users: don&#8217;t make users feel bad <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/10/26/StackOverflowDevDaysSeattle2009.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

It&#8217;s a decent in&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;tion to Git and you learn how to
do all the basic tasks as well as some more advanced topics.
The examples are clear and&nbsp;well-paced.</p>

how is Git used in the Linux kernel de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment process;

Malcolm Gladwell writes of the rather startling findings
concerning brain damage that American foot&shy;ballers sustain over their&nbsp;careers.</p>
<p>The constant butting of heads leads to an
enormously high rate of chronic traumatic en&shy;cephalopa&shy;thy (<span class="caps">C.T.</span>E.),
which has symptoms like Alzheimer&#8217;s.
It&#8217;s not just the con&shy;cus&shy;sions that cause it,
but all the sub&shy;con&shy;cus&shy;sive contact.
It&#8217;s almost as dangerous to one&#8217;s long-term health as&nbsp;boxing.</p>
<p>I grew up <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/03/21/RugbyGrandSlam.html">hating rugby</a> and trans&shy;ferred that hatred to American football.
I have no time for the game, which I find violent and repellent,
