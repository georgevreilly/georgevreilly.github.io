<p>I came across this cartoon today;
it reminded me that I've been meaning to write
about the hit-or-miss nature of adapting books for the screen.</p>
<p>Books and video/film are different media,
with different con&shy;ven&shy;tions and needs.
Often the most-loved elements of a book are lost
when it's adapted for television or film,
upsetting fans.</p>
<p>As J.K. Rowling wrote about one of the Harry Potter movies:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;It is simply impossible to in&shy;cor&shy;po&shy;rate every one of my storylines
into a film that has to be kept under four hours long.
Obviously films have re&shy;stric&shy;tions
â€“ novels do not have con&shy;straints of time and budget;
I can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but
the in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tion of <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/02/28/AdaptingBooksForFilmAndTV.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></blockquote>

explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From a cryp&shy;to&shy;graph&shy;ic standpoint, PGP is rock solid.
In practice, using it is very messy.
Its complexity has deterred the vast majority of people
who might otherwise benefit from using encryption.</p>
<p>The first problem is es&shy;tab&shy;lish&shy;ing a valid identity,
especially with other people located oceans away.
The second is dis&shy;trib&shy;ut&shy;ing public keys
without nefarious types posting al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tive keys
that appear to be registered to the same person.
...
The third issue is getting people to install and use PGP software.</p>

I didn't have high hopes for it and it was better than I expected.
Dennis left a pregnant Libby (Thandie Newton) at the altar five years ago.
Now he's an overweight security guard in a London lingerie shop
and she's found a new boyfriend who's everything that Dennis is not:
Whit (Hank Azaria) is well off, handsome, and very fit.
Somehow Dennis ends up promising to run in a marathon in three weeks' time
that Whit is also running in.
Much of the story revolves around his training,

<p>The Coen Brothers' latest movie, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail,_Caesar!">Hail, Caesar!</a>, is a lot of fun.
I've been looking forward to it since the trailers showed up a few months ago.
It's a homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood,
an age where quirky talents like the Coens
could not have made Coen Brothers' movies.
We see song and dance numbers, syn&shy;chro&shy;nized swimming,
singing cowboys, and ballroom dramas.
Most of all, we see a big-budget swords-and-sandals epic,
whose star, Baird Whitlock, has been kidnapped by The Future,
a group of Communist screen&shy;writ&shy;ers,
and is being held for $100,000 ransom.

<p>Both Trump and Cruz scare me, for very different reasons.
Trump is impulsive, all id, doesn't give a fuck,
riling up the worst impulses of the American electorate for short-term gain.

At that point, Rome's population was somewhere between one and two million people,
the largest city in Europe until 19th century London.
Con&shy;stan&shy;tine was Emperor and a few years later,
he would move his capital to Con&shy;stan&shy;tino&shy;ple.
A century and a half later, the final emperors would die.</p>
<p>I've only visited Rome once, when I was ten years old.
I'm long overdue for another visit.</p>

<p>New Orleans, 1834.
Benjamin January is a free man of color
and a Paris-trained surgeon who must support himself as a musician.
His sister Olympe, a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Voodoo">voodooi&shy;enne</a>, and another woman, CÃ©lie,
are accused of murdering CÃ©lie's husband,
and Ben must save them from hanging.
As a pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al musician and a colored man,
Ben moves between the high society of the old French in&shy;hab&shy;i&shy;tants
and the new American merchants,
the poor white areas of town,
the many slaves,
and the small free black middle class.

<p>A body has washed up in the canals of Venice,
that of an American soldier from the nearby US base at Vicenza.
Com&shy;mis&shy;sario Guido Brunetti doesn't believe that it's a mugging gone wrong,
especially when he sees the fear in the eyes
of the female army doctor who's sent to identify the body.
He digs and finds corruption among the rich and powerful, in a toxic coverup.</p>

It turns out that her siblings are still un&shy;re&shy;pen&shy;tant bigots,
but he finds himself drawn to two of his cousins,
pretty young Catherine Callahan
and Brendan O'Malley, a poet whose brother Sean has just been murdered.
Cousin Benny finds himself drawn into in&shy;ternecine feuding between the IRA and the INLA,

a kinetic feast of racing cars and roaring maniacs

Imperator Furiosa and Max flee across the desert,
taking Immortan Joe's five nubile wives to a better place.
They seek hope, Furiosa seeks redemption, and Max seeks mostly to survive.
