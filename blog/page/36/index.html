<p><em>Ob&shy;jec&shy;ti&shy;fied</em> is a doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary about industrial design
and the man&shy;u&shy;fac&shy;tured objects that litter our lives.
In interviews with some leading designers,
Hustwit brings forth such topics as
our emotional attachment to those objects;
the ephemer&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ty and planned ob&shy;soles&shy;ence of most of this “stuff”;
the approaches of different designers;
designing the man&shy;u&shy;fac&shy;tur&shy;ing process as well as the object;
how good design often almost dis&shy;ap&shy;pears;
sus&shy;tain&shy;abil&shy;i&shy;ty, when most objects end up in landfill;
in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tion and interface design;
etc.</p>
<p>The danger with such a broad survey
is that you can't do justice to anything.
I was left wanting to know more about many of the topics.
In the Q&amp;A afterwards, Hustwit mentioned that <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/06/11/ReviewObjectified.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I just sent out the Evite for Frank's memorial on July 5th.
If you didn't receive a copy and you'd like to go, let me know.</p>
<p>Next up, choose the poems and music.
We may reprise some of those that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/04/20/ReadingFranksPoems.aspx">I read at Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters</a>.
Certainly, we should read “How to Eat a Slug”.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most ir&shy;refutable sign of middle age for me
was getting <a class="reference external" href="http://www.allaboutvision.com/over40/progressive.htm">pro&shy;gres&shy;sive lenses</a> six months ago.</p>
<p>I had noticed for several months that I was having a little difficulty with smaller print,
and a visit to the op&shy;tometrist confirmed that I needed reading glasses.
Now I'm near-sighted and far-sighted, all at the same time.</p>
<p>The new glasses took some getting used to.
I had been accustomed to looking through any part of the lens.
Now I had to tilt my head downwards rather than simply turn my eyes down,
if I wanted to look at the floor,
or I'd be looking through the short-distance reading portion.</p>
<p>These lenses are <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/06/08/ProgressiveLenses.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>ESR writes about <a class="reference external" href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=1024#more-1024">Elo&shy;cu&shy;tion&shy;ary Punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion</a>,
dis&shy;tin&shy;guish&shy;ing it from syntactic punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion.
The latter, says he, is the style taught in schools,
where the punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion cor&shy;re&shy;sponds to gram&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal phrase structure.
Elo&shy;cu&shy;tion&shy;ary punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion treats punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion as
markers of speech cadence and intonation.</p>
<p>I think I fall in this camp.
I'm careful about my punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion,
though I can't nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;i&shy;ly articulate
why I choose one way over another.
If it <em>sounds</em> right in my head, that's the way I go.
Even before I started doing staged readings,
I paid attention to how my writing would sound,
were it read aloud.</p>
<p>While I'm pon&shy;tif&shy;i&shy;cat&shy;ing on punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion,
let me say that I'm a firm proponent of the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma">serial comma</a>—the comma just before <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/06/07/ElocutionaryPunctuation.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.kubota.org/">Kubota Garden</a> is a little-known gem in the Rainier Beach area of south Seattle.
Twenty acres of hills and valleys in a Japanese style.</p>
<p>Emma and I met Lyndol down there this morning
and rambled through the garden for two hours.
It was a fine, overcast day, with tem&shy;per&shy;a&shy;tures in the low 60s and occasional driz&shy;zle—and a pleasant relief from the record heat of earlier this week.
I had visited there before:
it's at the far end of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/transportation/chiefsealthtrail.htm">Chief Sealth bicycle trail</a>.
Lyn had too, but it was Emma's first visit.</p>

for Mac and Linux yesterday.
I've tried it on my OS&nbsp;10.5 MacBook and my Ubuntu Jaunty Netbook Remix netbook.</p>
<p>Chrome works fairly well, so far.
It seems slow at resolving hostnames,
but otherwise downloads pages quickly.
Rendering speed is good.
Gmail comes up in an amazingly short time, as in Windows Chrome.
It uses less CPU than Safari or Camino.</p>
<p>Favicons are not showing up in tabs on Mac.
Fonts are not an&shy;tialiased on Linux.</p>
<p>As a user, I'm happy to see that there is real com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion between the browsers
after the stagnation in the first half of this decade, when IE6 ruled.

<p>I just spent over an hour wrestling with the Address Book in Evite,
trying to convince it to import a pile of freeform addresses, to no avail.
I had to paste them in one-by-one, clicking Add for each one.
Feh.</p>
<p>I succeeded in my bigger goal and that was to send out an

<p>Frank Maloney was a longtime regular in this newsgroup.
After a long illness, he died on January 6th, 2009 at his home.</p>
<p>Some of Frank's friends are helping Lyndol,
his partner of more than 30 years,
to put together a memorial for Frank.
It'll be held near Seattle on the afternoon of July 5th.</p>
<p>Frank was a published poet and we'll be reading some of his poems.
But he also spent more than 20 years par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pat&shy;ing in newsgroups,
posted thousands of articles, and made many online friends.
It seems fitting for us to read some of his voluminous output.</p>
