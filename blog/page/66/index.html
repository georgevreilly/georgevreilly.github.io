<p>At 12:44am Monday (Irish Time), Michelle gave birth to a 9lb 8oz boy.
Mother and son are healthy but exhausted.
I'm not sure quite how long the actual labor lasted;
but I think she started late on Saturday.</p>
<p>My nephew is, as yet, unnamed.
David and Michelle have yet to find a boy's name that both of them really like.
Under Irish law, they have three months to do so,
but Michelle hopes to pick a name within a few days at most.</p>

<p>Rozan weaves together two stories here, past and present.</p>
<p>Seven children, four boys and three girls,
grow up together on Staten Island in the 1960s and 70s.
In early adulthood, one of the young men ac&shy;ci&shy;den&shy;tal&shy;ly kills another,
then is killed in prison.
A third boy, Jimmy McCaffrey, becomes estranged from the others
and moves to Manhattan where he rises in the Fire Department.</p>
<p>Jimmy dies in the Twin Towers on 9/11,
doing what he did best: saving people.
A month later, a washed-up newspaper reporter writes a story

The focus has switched to a younger set of characters,
the first generation to grow up after the “Change”,
the event that knocked the world back into the Dark Ages.</p>
<p>A traveler arrives in Oregon from the East, bearing a compelling prophecy that
requires Rudi Mackenzie to travel to Nantucket, the apparent source of the Change.
A group of nine (the number is tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al) head eastwards.
But the fanatical Church Universal and Triumphant wants to stop them.</p>

<p>When my parents visited me in September,
I bought them a second laptop and an external drive for backup.
One laptop stays in Dublin, the other in Cape Town where they spend much of their year.
Both laptops are in Dublin with me at present,
so that I can clean them up and get them in sync.
(I had to remove some very obscure registry settings to
get one DVD drive working again. &lt;sigh/&gt;)</p>
<p>Their backup needs are simple.
Both of them have web-based email at Yahoo!.
The only personal data on either computer is photos.
Inevitably the photos are out of sync between the two machines.</p>

The hunch&shy;backed lawyer Matthew Shardlake
has been sent to York by Archbishop Cranmer to meet the Royal Progress,
where Henry VIII is to accept formal surrender from those
who had earlier rebelled.
Shardlake is to hear petitions on the king's behalf,

is brought safely back to the Tower of London.
He stumbles upon a cache of secret papers,
which leads to a series of attempts upon his life.</p>

<p>My friends Frank and Lyndol met 32 years ago today,
the day they celebrate as their an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
For several years, Emma and I have brought them out for dinner on this date.
We also celebrate Lyn's birthday,
which falls next week.</p>
<p>Frank's health has been poor for some years,
but it's grown worse this year.
He spent six weeks in hospital in September and October.
He's home now, but he's in <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.motss/browse_thread/thread/38e9223106252317">hospice care</a>.</p>

since he rarely feels strong enough to leave the house,
even in a wheelchair.
We almost always find him in good form,
glad to see us and ready with his stories.</p>

<p>It snowed in Seattle yesterday.
We drove over to Sammamish last night to my CEO's house
for the Holiday Party.
The snow wasn't sticking to the roads,
so although visibility wasn't great,
getting there and back was not difficult.</p>
<p>It was cold today and colder tonight.
I saw only a light dusting of snow fall today,
but the snow that was melting earlier has refrozen.</p>
<p>We had to go out this evening,
over to Burien to see Frank.
The main roads were fine,
but we had a slightly alarming descent
on a hill near us as we headed over there.
Coming home, we had a couple of unpleasant minutes
