<p>I wrote <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/12/17/ToFrankAndLyndol.html">three weeks ago</a>, that Frank's time was limited.
He died yesterday at 3am of liver failure.
He had been un&shy;con&shy;scious since Saturday,
and he had been moved to a hospital bed in his living room on Thursday.</p>
<p>I was at a coffee shop near work yesterday morning
when Emma called me to relay the news from Lyndol.
We hurried over there and spent the rest of the day with him,
helping out as various friends came over.</p>
<p>Lyn is doing as well as can be expected.
He's sad, oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly weepy, and sometimes a little manic.
I think he's relieved that Frank's ordeal is over.

<p>At 12:44am Monday (Irish Time), Michelle gave birth to a 9lb 8oz boy.
Mother and son are healthy but exhausted.
I'm not sure quite how long the actual labor lasted;
but I think she started late on Saturday.</p>
<p>My nephew is, as yet, unnamed.
David and Michelle have yet to find a boy's name that both of them really like.
Under Irish law, they have three months to do so,
but Michelle hopes to pick a name within a few days at most.</p>

<p>Rozan weaves together two stories here, past and present.</p>
<p>Seven children, four boys and three girls,
grow up together on Staten Island in the 1960s and 70s.
In early adulthood, one of the young men ac&shy;ci&shy;den&shy;tal&shy;ly kills another,
then is killed in prison.
A third boy, Jimmy McCaffrey, becomes estranged from the others
and moves to Manhattan where he rises in the Fire Department.</p>
<p>Jimmy dies in the Twin Towers on 9/11,
doing what he did best: saving people.
A month later, a washed-up newspaper reporter writes a story

The focus has switched to a younger set of characters,
the first generation to grow up after the “Change”,
the event that knocked the world back into the Dark Ages.</p>
<p>A traveler arrives in Oregon from the East, bearing a compelling prophecy that
requires Rudi Mackenzie to travel to Nantucket, the apparent source of the Change.
A group of nine (the number is tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al) head eastwards.
But the fanatical Church Universal and Triumphant wants to stop them.</p>

<p>When my parents visited me in September,
I bought them a second laptop and an external drive for backup.
One laptop stays in Dublin, the other in Cape Town where they spend much of their year.
Both laptops are in Dublin with me at present,
so that I can clean them up and get them in sync.
(I had to remove some very obscure registry settings to
get one DVD drive working again. &lt;sigh/&gt;)</p>
<p>Their backup needs are simple.
Both of them have web-based email at Yahoo!.
The only personal data on either computer is photos.
Inevitably the photos are out of sync between the two machines.</p>

<p>2008 closes, leaving economic wreckage in its wake.
Personally and pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly, it's been a good year.
At the national level, it's been both a very good year and a disastrous one.
Obama's historic victory is offset by the imploding economy.</p>
<p>My health remains good, I'm a little fitter than I was a year ago.
I've notched up a few personal milestones,
such as receiving my Competent Com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tor award at Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters and
becoming the secretary of Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters.</p>
<p>My friends and family are, mostly, doing well.
My sister is (still!) on the verge of having her first child.
Emma's health is never great:

The hunch&shy;backed lawyer Matthew Shardlake
has been sent to York by Archbishop Cranmer to meet the Royal Progress,
where Henry VIII is to accept formal surrender from those
who had earlier rebelled.
Shardlake is to hear petitions on the king's behalf,
but really he is there to ensure that a high-ranking con&shy;spir&shy;a&shy;tor
is brought safely back to the Tower of London.
He stumbles upon a cache of secret papers,
which leads to a series of attempts upon his life.</p>

<p>When I was a boy, anytime we said ‘Dundrum’ (a suburb of Dublin),
it was with a snigger, because it was synonymous in our minds
with the <a class="reference external" href="http://wikimapia.org/72462/Central-Mental-Hospital-Dundrum">mental asylum</a> located there.
Nowadays, Dundrum is much better known as the home of a large
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dundrum.ie/">shopping centre</a>.
I'm so out of touch with Dublin that I hadn't realized
that there was a major new shopping centre there.
I assumed that people were talking about the unim&shy;pres&shy;sive
little centre that I remembered there from my childhood.
Until today, when we went there to return the
mobile phone that we had given my mother for Christmas.</p>
<p>Dundrum was, indeed, a madhouse.
