<p>Nine years ago, the Ryan Commission was set up to produce
a report on physical, emotional, and sexual abuse of children
in Catholic Church–run re&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;to&shy;ries in Ireland.
This week, they released a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/europe/21ireland.html">2600-page report</a>
detailing abuse to tens of thousands of children from the 1930s to the 1990s.
The abuse and violence were systemic and in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ized, if not universal,
and they were hushed up and overlooked for decades.
The stories of the abused, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0523/1224247210382.html">in their own words</a>, make for horrifying reading.
It's a national disgrace.</p>
<p>The Christian Brothers come off the worst of the many religious orders who are implicated.
Even in their day schools, they long had a reputation <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/05/23/ChildAbuseInIreland.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I initially learned to drive on the left in Ireland,
but have spent the last 20 years driving on the right in the States.
I personally never had any difficulty switching from one side to the oth&shy;er—ex&shy;cept when extremely jet&shy;lagged—but I know several people who find it enormously stressful.
I find it easy enough to orient myself so that the lane divider is at the correct position.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, my father often brought his Irish car
over to mainland Europe on the car ferries.
A right-hand drive car driving on the right is doubly tricky.
It didn't seem to bother him too much, but <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/05/21/DrivingOnTheOtherSideOfTheRoad.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>For many years, I ignored the freeway sign for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rhodygarden.org/">Rhodo&shy;den&shy;dron Garden</a>
at exit 143 on I-5.
Five or six years ago, I visited the Rhody Garden
and I've gone back every spring since.</p>
<p>It's worth visiting at any time of year,
but from March to May or June, it's in bloom.
Twenty-two acres of rhodo&shy;den&shy;drons, azaleas, ferns, and other flowers,
near the Wey&shy;er&shy;hauser head&shy;quar&shy;ters in Federal Way, Washington.
There's a bonsai garden next door—un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly now closed to the public.
As you stroll along the shaded hilly paths,
you can almost make believe that the constant traffic noise
from the nearby freeway is running water.</p>

<p>A conman publisher visits a writing circle in Chichester
and gets their hopes up.
Soon, he is burned to death in his cottage.
Other arson-murders follow.</p>
<p>In the first half of the book, the story is primarily told
from the viewpoint of the newest member of the writers' circle, Bob Naylor,
who starts in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gat&shy;ing, egged on by some of the others.
In the second half, it becomes a police procedural,
as seen by Detective Chief Inspector Henrietta Mallin,
who takes over the case.</p>
<p><em>The Circle</em> is a whodunnit in the classic vein,
with in&shy;ter&shy;fer&shy;ing amateur detectives <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/05/19/ReviewTheCircle.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I mentioned CrossLoop <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/01/24/CrossLoop.aspx">before</a>, as a tool for remotely helping someone out.
It uses VNC to share desktops.</p>
<p>The last time I looked, it was Windows only.
Now there's a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.crossloop.com/ipage.htm?id=predownload">Mac client</a> too.</p>
<p>I had to use it to help my father out in Dublin.
Somehow he had managed to delete both Adobe Reader and Adobe Flash—I haven't figured out how.</p>
<p>It was painful, painful, painful.
The connection was dropped repeatedly
and the link couldn't begin to keep up with the amount of graphical data being trans&shy;ferred.
Even though CrossLoop reduces the color depth,
actions like switching tabs in Firefox cause huge amounts of data to be sent.

<p>I tried Safari 4 on my MacBook back in February when it first came out in beta.
It <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/02/25/Safari4FAIL.aspx">crashed im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly, every time</a>, so I unin&shy;stalled it.</p>
<p>I upgraded to OS X 10.5.7 earlier in the week and new Safari bits were available,
so it seemed like a good time to retry it.
After all, it had been faster than any other browser on my Vista box at work.</p>
<p>Again, it crashed im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly.
This time, however, I took a closer look at the details of the
error report that was being sent to Apple.
A little Googling suggested that the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.machangout.com/">Glims</a> plugin was at fault.
Indeed it was.

It's a fine painting by Ellen Coyle.
The shrunken image here doesn't do it justice.

<p>We're rehearsing most Wednesdays for our reading of the
first half of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/04/30/Bloomsday2009PressRelease.aspx">Circe chapter of Ulysses</a> next month.
It's going well.
We need some more rehearsal, but it now sounds like we know what we're doing.
Tonight we read the entire piece through from beginning to end,
for the first time.
Now we know that it takes two-and-a-quarter hours.</p>
<p>We also got the poster tonight.
It looks great!
I'd post it, but I need to get the painting scanned first.</p>
