<p>For weeks, Lyn has been telling us about the musical talk that
he was going to give today at his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rvuuc.org/">UU con&shy;gre&shy;ga&shy;tion</a>
about <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Strayhorn">Billy Strayhorn</a>, a little-known but talented composer,
who col&shy;lab&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ed for decades with Duke Ellington.
Strayhorn was openly gay in the homophobic decades before Stonewall.
That, coupled with his apparent liking for remaining in Elling&shy;ton's shadow,
probably con&shy;tributed to his obscurity.</p>
<p>Lyn talked about Billy Strayhorn and his life and music for half an hour.
He also ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;nied Shirley singing some Strayhorn songs on piano,
as Linda and Marion played the clarinet and cello.
He said that Stray&shy;horn's life gives rise to two questions,

<p>I mentioned <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/06/20/WhenVideoCardsGoBad.aspx">three weeks ago</a> that I had just repaved my work dev box
and installed the 64-bit version of the Windows&nbsp;7&nbsp;RC.
Nine or ten years after I first ported parts of IIS to Win64,
I am finally running my main desktop on 64-bit Windows.
With one exception, it's been painless.
Programs have just worked, devices have just worked.
There are relatively few native x64 ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions,
but for the most part it doesn't matter.
The cases where it does matter—e.g., shell extensions such as <a class="reference external" href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">Tor&shy;tois&shy;eSVN</a>—are available as 64-bit binaries.</p>
<p>I briefly flirted with using the 64-bit build of Python,

<p>We held our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/07/08/HealthCareNowRallyOnThursday.aspx">rally</a> for healthcare and the public option at lunchtime,
outside the Jackson Federal Building
where both Senators Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray
have their Seattle offices.</p>
<p>Turnout was good: about 100 people, I'd say.
We had about half-a-dozen speakers over 45 minutes.
A cameraman from King–5 covered it, but I can't find anything on their website.
A handful of people went upstairs to the senators' offices
and delivered 291&nbsp;pages of petitions.</p>
<p>One concrete suggestion that I came away with
is to write a <em>hand&shy;writ&shy;ten</em> letter to the senators
advocating for healthcare reform.
Hand&shy;writ&shy;ten letters carry more weight than printed letters or calls
and much more weight than emails.</p>
<p>Do it soon.

<p>We're traveling to Spain and Ireland for three weeks.
I'm bringing the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/04/25/UbuntuNetbookRemix904.aspx">netbook</a>, not the 17&quot;&nbsp;MacBook Pro, because it's small and light.
It doesn't have a DVD player and I'd like to bring some DVDs to watch.
I could either spend about $80 on an external DVD player,
or I could rip the DVDs beforehand.</p>
<p>I've ripped a few DVDs with <a class="reference external" href="http://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a>,
an open source, cross-platform video transcoder,
which seems to do a good job.
I'm playing them in the cross-platform <a class="reference external" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> player,
which released version 1.0.0 yesterday, after almost 8&nbsp;years of de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, a group of us <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/06/27/TalkingToSenatorsAboutHealthcareReform.aspx">visited our senators' offices</a>
to talk to their staffers about the Public Option in health care.
We're organizing a downtown Seattle rally at the Federal Building on Thursday at 12:15pm,
where both Senators Cantwell and Murray have their offices.
It's one of the large number of rallies that <a class="reference external" href="http://pol.moveon.org/event/events/index.html?action_id=180">MoveOn.org is organizing</a>
at senators' offices all around the country on Thursday.</p>

He is asked to look into the murder of the wife of a teacher
at the exclusive Carne <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_school_(UK)">public school</a>,
as he can mix socially with the staff while the police cannot.
She had sent a letter predicting that her husband would murder her.
The couple were from a lower-class, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonconformism">Non&shy;con&shy;formist</a> background.
He had tried to assimilate, she had not, and it had rankled the snobs.</p>

<p>Lyn, Raven, and Iain came over on Friday night for dinner.
We did a little planning for Frank's memorial today
and selected some poems.</p>
<p>Emma and I packed up the car and got to Lyn's by noon,
which gave us plenty of time to set up.
I wore my com&shy;mem&shy;o&shy;ra&shy;tive <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/07/03/PortlandMotssconXXII.aspx">Portland motsscon</a> t-shirt,
which I know Frank would have gotten a kick out of.</p>
<p>A dozen or so of Frank's friends arrived around 2&nbsp;o'clock.
We chatted for a while waiting for Holly and Kim to arrive

<p>Le Carré's very first novel,
<em>Call for the Dead</em> introduces his most famous character, George Smiley.
After a harmonious meeting with Smiley to review his security clearance,
Samuel Fennan goes home, writes a letter com&shy;plain&shy;ing of har&shy;rass&shy;ment,
and commits suicide.
But little things don't add up and Smiley starts in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gat&shy;ing,
only to be nearly murdered himself.</p>
<p>A strong debut, and amazingly short at 160&nbsp;pages.
<em>Call</em> provides some background about Smiley's very bad war,
undercover in Nazi ter&shy;ri&shy;to&shy;ries, and his rocky marriage.</p>

<p>Barely a month ago, while cleaning up Frank Maloney's Facebook account,
I became aware of <a class="reference external" href="http://motsscon.hostica.com/">Portland Motsscon XXII</a>.</p>
<p>I discovered the <a class="reference external" href="http://soc-motss.org/">soc.motss</a> newsgroup back in 1989,
when I arrived in America as a grad student at Brown and had steady access to Usenet.
MOTSS = members of the same sex, an opaque euphemism for gay attraction,
which helped the group be created with a minimum of fuss in 1983.</p>
<p>I lurked on soc.motss for two years.
I knew that I was bisexual, but I wasn't ready to admit it to anyone.
Then my friend Éamonn came out as gay and I promptly came out to him.

<p>For 13 months in 1933–34, John Dillinger robbed banks all over the Midwest,
leaving behind a legend and con&shy;tribut&shy;ing to the growth of the FBI.
Johnny Depp gives a charis&shy;mat&shy;ic per&shy;for&shy;mance of a ruthless and audacious killer,
who endeared himself to the public as
he liked to give money back to the customers of the banks he was robbing.
Christian Bale is the cold, efficient lead FBI agent,
in charge of a brutal and not very competent team,
little better than the men they chased.
