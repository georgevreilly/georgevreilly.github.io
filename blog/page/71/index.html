<p>Michelle and her husband David B† came over for dinner.
Her baby is now nine days overdue
and she's more than ready to give birth.</p>
<p>† Not to be confused with the other David, our brother,
who is currently living at my parents' house in Dublin.</p>
<p>We had lunch with Alan and Sheena in Dundrum and met their new <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/12/14/NewBabies.aspx">baby</a>.</p>
<p>It's been very hard to hook up with my old friends here.
We landed seven days ago and the only other meet up
was a couple of pints with Jimmy on Monday.
They're (almost) all middle-aged, mortgaged, married, and bechilded,
and otherwise busy with their own lives.

<p>When I was a boy, anytime we said ‘Dundrum’ (a suburb of Dublin),
it was with a snigger, because it was synonymous in our minds
with the <a class="reference external" href="http://wikimapia.org/72462/Central-Mental-Hospital-Dundrum">mental asylum</a> located there.
Nowadays, Dundrum is much better known as the home of a large
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dundrum.ie/">shopping centre</a>.
I'm so out of touch with Dublin that I hadn't realized
that there was a major new shopping centre there.
I assumed that people were talking about the unim&shy;pres&shy;sive
little centre that I remembered there from my childhood.
Until today, when we went there to return the
mobile phone that we had given my mother for Christmas.</p>
<p>Dundrum was, indeed, a madhouse.
There's much talk of a <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/27/Dundrum.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

an ambitious senator arrives from the capital to take over.
Tavi finally comes into his own,

Far to the south, Amara and Bernard accompany the First Lord, Gaius Sixtus,

<p>Normally, we have Shuttle Express take us to Sea-Tac airport,
but they were completely booked up when I tried to make a reser&shy;va&shy;tion
earlier in the week.
Lyndol very kindly came over at 6am and drove us down to the airport.</p>
<p>Our plane left an hour late from Seattle,
as it came in late the night before
and the crew had to wait for the statutory FTC minimum stopover.
The late departure from Seatac was no problem,
since we had a scheduled 5-hour layover in Philadelpia.
After being shoehorned into the plane,
we needed to stretch and wandered through several of the terminals.
The only excitement was when I realized an <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/21/InDublin.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I tried to take the bus into work today, but no bus showed.
I later learned that the #39 had been “tem&shy;porar&shy;i&shy;ly suspended”.
Emma drove into downtown Seattle, getting off at the James St. exit.
James is steep and it was closed to traffic.
She let me out at 7th and James and
I walked down to the Smith Tower.</p>
<p>Other people were <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/392969_bus20.html">not so lucky</a> on the steeper streets,
as you can see in the photo of a bus hanging over the interstate.</p>

<p>When we went to bed on Wednesday night, most of the weekend's snow had melted.
We were woken around 5:30am by two large <a class="reference external" href="http://beaconhill.seattle.wa.us/2008/12/18/did-you-hear-that/">thunder claps</a>,
attributed to <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/392821_storm19.html">thun&shy;der&shy;snow</a>.
The snow was falling again and fell for most of the day.</p>
<p>We were sensible and stayed home.
So, it seems, did almost everyone else at Cozi.
I worked remotely for part of the day.
Otherwise, we watched movies.
I felt no desire to go outside and make snowmen,
though we certainly could have.</p>
<p>We fly to Ireland on Saturday morning.
I'm a little worried about getting to the airport.</p>

<p>I'm Irish. I was raised on butter.
Not margarine. Butter.
Good Irish butter.
Yellow, creamy, with a little salt.</p>
<p>Melted onto toast.
A soft yellow layer on bread.
A pat of butter on your potatoes.
Fry your eggs in butter.
Let butter melt on your chips.</p>
<p>I knew butter was important in baking,
but I didn't realize until <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/dining/17bake.html">today</a> how carefully it should be treated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common mistakes made by home bakers, pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;als say,
have to do with the care and handling of one ingredient: butter.
Creaming butter correctly, keeping butter doughs cold,
and starting with fresh, good-tasting butter
are vital details that pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;als take for granted,
and home bakers often miss.</p>

<p>My friends Frank and Lyndol met 32 years ago today,
the day they celebrate as their an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
For several years, Emma and I have brought them out for dinner on this date.
We also celebrate Lyn's birthday,
which falls next week.</p>
<p>Frank's health has been poor for some years,
but it's grown worse this year.
He spent six weeks in hospital in September and October.
He's home now, but he's in <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.motss/browse_thread/thread/38e9223106252317">hospice care</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, we try to see him often,
since he rarely feels strong enough to leave the house,
even in a wheelchair.
We almost always find him in good form,
glad to see us and ready with his stories.</p>
