The range and quality of their cured meats is truly impressive.
The flavor, excellent.
Their counter staff, friendly and family-like.
The line goes out the&nbsp;door.</p>
<p>But. But.&nbsp;But.</p>
<p>Their service is wretched.
That line moves at a glacial pace.
I&#8217;ve never taken less than 20 minutes to get a sandwich;
sometimes twice that.
The staff are slow and in&shy;ef&shy;fi&shy;cient.
Their stations are badly laid out
and they have to fumble around each other
in their pokey little&nbsp;store.</p>
<p>Every time I watch them at work—and I always
have plenty of time to watch them work—I want
to drag them over to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/jimmy-johns-seattle-3">Jimmy John&#8217;s</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/bakemans-restaurant-seattle">Bakeman&#8217;s</a>.

<p>I made my <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/01/05/ChristmasCake.html">Christmas Cake</a> back in November,
but am only now getting around to putting on the icing.
I&#8217;ve kept it moist with several ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions of&nbsp;whiskey.</p>
<p>Last year, I made <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzipan">marzipan</a> from scratch.
Never again!
It was a huge amount of work to blanch the almonds
and the stiff mixture of sugar and almonds caused the
food processor to seize up more than&nbsp;once.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t use up all the marzipan that I made that time.
I put the remainder into a sealed container,
placed it in the fridge, and forgot all about it.
When I took it out of the fridge yesterday,
it was still good.
Oh, the top half-inch had hardened

<p>For several years, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> has been my default browser.
Firefox&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">extensions</a> have always been its paramount feature for me,
but its per&shy;for&shy;mance and developer tools came close.
I&#8217;m very happy with it, for the most&nbsp;part.</p>
<p>The one thing that makes me unhappy is Firefox 3&#8217;s <span class="caps">CPU</span> con&shy;sump&shy;tion.
Time and again, I find it running at close to full uti&shy;liza&shy;tion of one <span class="caps">CPU</span> core
on my MacBook Pro.
The tipoff is usually the warmth of the metal case.
Killing the Gmail tab tends to help, but not enough.
In Firefox 2, the worst problem was the memory leaks.
Within hours, it would have chewed up several hundred megabytes.
Memory usage is better <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/01/22/UsingOpera.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Eight years ago, the Onion published a supposed speech
by then President-elect George Bush, called
‘Our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784">Long National Nightmare</a> Of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over’.
How&nbsp;prophetic!</p>
<p>Finally, the long national nightmare of the George W. Bush presidency is&nbsp;over.</p>
<p>Barack Obama took the oath of office today.
His <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/us/politics/20text-obama.html?pagewanted=all">inaugural speech</a> was somber, reasoned, cautionary, and
in&shy;spi&shy;ra&shy;tional—of a piece with the&nbsp;man.</p>
<p>He faces enormous dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ties.
There are enormous op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ties too, if he can but seize them.
The polls say that the American people do not expect overnight miracles.
I hope we will all remember that a year from&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to Obama and his&nbsp;presidency.</p>

    <p>Twenty years ago tomorrow, I attended <a class="reference external" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DA1538F932A15752C0A96F948260">Bush Senior&#8217;s In&shy;au&shy;gu&shy;ra&shy;tion</a>.
By&nbsp;accident.</p>
<p>I was on my first solo trip to the United States,
having arrived in New York the previous week.
There I had purchased a 30-day unlimited standby ticket with Delta.
It cost me only $400, as I could produce my round-the-world&nbsp;ticket.</p>
<p>For no par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly good reason, I decided to start
the 30 days with a trip to Washington <span class="caps">DC</span>.
There were museums there and it was&nbsp;nearby.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t been paying close attention to the news, and
it was only when I got to Washington that I realized that
George <span class="caps">H.W.</span> Bush&#8217;s in&shy;au&shy;gu&shy;ra&shy;tion was to be be held the next day.

<p>Milk was a middle-aged closet case who moved to San Francisco in the early 1970s,
became po&shy;lit&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly active, and started running for office,
un&shy;suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly at first.
“The Mayor of Castro Street” was elected to the San Francisco Board of
Su&shy;per&shy;vi&shy;sors in 1977,
the first openly gay man to hold public office in the United States.
A year later, only days after the anti-gay Cal&shy;i&shy;forn&shy;ian ballot initiative,
Propo&shy;si&shy;tion 6, went down to defeat,
Milk and Mayor George Moscone were murdered by ex-Supervisor Dan&nbsp;White.</p>

Metro is proposing to close the one really useful route,
the #39 which takes me to work in Pioneer Square.
The #60 gets me to 12th and S. Jackson,
nearly a mile from work.
The #36 only runs down 15th in the evenings;
otherwise it runs through Jefferson Park, half a mile&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>The new #50 route will be a poor re&shy;place&shy;ment,

<p>Last Sunday President-elect Barack Obama was asked whether he would seek an
in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion of possible crimes by the Bush ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion. “I don’t
believe that anybody is above the law,” he responded, but “we need to look
forward as opposed to looking&nbsp;backwards.”</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but if we don’t have an inquest into what happened during the
Bush years — and nearly everyone has taken Mr. Obama’s remarks to mean that
we won’t — this means that those who hold power are indeed above the law
because they don’t face any con&shy;se&shy;quences if they abuse their&nbsp;power.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always been a fast reader, faster than most people.
I&#8217;ve read and reviewed 176 books in just over two years,
or about two books a week.
That doesn&#8217;t count newspapers, magazines, blogs, and other online&nbsp;reading.</p>
<p>When I was 10, I had an operation on both my feet
and I spent all summer with my legs in plaster.
My mother had to go to the library every day
because they&#8217;d only let her take out three books at a time for me.
On the flight back from Ireland two weeks ago,
I read <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/04/ReviewAbsentFriends.html">two</a> 500-page <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/03/ReviewTheSunriseLands.html">books</a>.

<p>I seldom get bad colds, but I caught one on the plane back from Ireland,
and it&#8217;s left me drained of energy for the last ten days.
Jet lag and Frank&#8217;s death surely con&shy;tributed too.&nbsp;Feh!</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll be up to cycling into work tomorrow.
Between the snow, being in Ireland for two weeks, and this cold,
it&#8217;s been almost a month since I last rode&nbsp;in.</p>
