<p>Good article on how the Bush ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion is
<a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/133628_tito10.html">using language to influence public opinion</a>.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p><em>Civil service reform</em> means &quot;flex&shy;i&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty&quot; to replace civil service
protection with cronyism and patronage.</p>
<p><em>Pri&shy;va&shy;ti&shy;za&shy;tion</em> justifies the notion that cor&shy;po&shy;ra&shy;tions are more likely to
serve the public interest than publicly owned utilities, schools and
prisons.</p>
<p><em>Support the troops</em>, a brilliant concept, suggests that if you question
foreign policy or war policy, you have the deaths of our finest young men
and women in uniform on your hands. Objective: to stifle public dissent.</p>

<p>I found an in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing piece about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/22_politics.shtml">what makes a political con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tive</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four re&shy;searchers who culled through 50 years of research literature
about the psychology of con&shy;ser&shy;vatism report that at the core of
political con&shy;ser&shy;vatism is the resistance to change and a tolerance for
inequality, and that some of the common psy&shy;cho&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal factors linked to
political con&shy;ser&shy;vatism include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fear and aggression</li>
<li>Dogmatism and in&shy;tol&shy;er&shy;ance of ambiguity</li>
<li>Un&shy;cer&shy;tain&shy;ty avoidance</li>

<p>As I mentioned in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2003/05/16/Naturalization.aspx">my Toast&shy;mas&shy;ter&shy;s' speech about nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;iza&shy;tion</a>, I decided
on September 11th, 2002 to become a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>This morning, I had my interview with the Bureau of Cit&shy;i&shy;zen&shy;ship and
Im&shy;mi&shy;gra&shy;tion Services (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bcis.gov/">BCIS</a>, formerly known as the INS).</p>
<p>This afternoon, I was sworn in as a U.S. citizen at the Seattle INS Office.
Eighty-three other new citizens were sworn in at the same time. Many were
Filipino, Vietnamese, Mexican, or Eastern European. Only three others, all
Brits, were from Western Europe. We were gathered into a stuffy room with
an overflow crowd of relatives and friends. <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/07/25/USCitizen.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I gave the following speech to Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters on June 25th, 2003, as Speech
#4, &quot;Show What You Mean&quot;. Clearly, I've reused some material from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2003/06/11/Bloomsday.aspx">my earlier post about Bloomsday</a>.
I'm also finding that I take longer to
deliver a speech to an audience than I do when rehearsing, so I cut some of
the material on the day to fit the seven-minute limit.</p>
<p>I've uploaded <a class="reference external" href="http://www.george-reilly.com/photos/Bloomsday-2003/">some photos of the reading</a>
to one of my other websites.</p>

<p>I detest George W. Bush and his ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion. The war, the economy, the
en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment, the judicial battles. I loathe just about everything that
comes out of the White House. I want that man <em>gone</em>.</p>
<p>I've been following the Democratic pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial candidates with some
interest for the last few months. Right now, I feel like I'm a yellow dog
Democrat. I don't care who wins in 2004, just so long as it's a Democrat.</p>
<p>That's not really true, however. I'd much rather have a candidate that I
have some enthusiasm for, rather than the lesser of two evils: <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/06/12/HowardDeanForPresident.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I have recently become involved with the upcoming local cel&shy;e&shy;bra&shy;tion of
Bloomsday, on June 16th. James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em> takes place on June 16th,
1904. In Seattle and elsewhere, fans of the book re-enact portions of the
book. In Dublin, Joyce has spawned a whole industry: ironic, when you
consider how little recog&shy;ni&shy;tion he received there during his lifetime. No
doubt, the Joycean industry will go into overdrive next year for the
centenary.</p>
<p>The Seattle group has been working its way through the book since 1998.
This year, we are reading Chapters 8 and 9, &quot;Lestry&shy;go&shy;ni&shy;ans&quot; and &quot;Scylla and
Charybdis&quot;. <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/06/11/Bloomsday.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>NAT&shy;U&shy;RAL&shy;IZA&shy;TION</p>
<p>Fellow Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters and Guests, last September, on the first
an&shy;niver&shy;sary of 9/11, I made one of the biggest decisions of my life: I
decided to apply for American cit&shy;i&shy;zen&shy;ship, to become nat&shy;u&shy;ral&shy;ized.</p>
<p>Like many of you, I am an immigrant. I have spent most of my adult life
in this country. Fourteen years ago, I came to the US from Ireland to
earn a Masters degree. I moved to Seattle in 1992, the same year that I
became a permanent resident. I <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2003/05/16/Naturalization.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>My wife is a cyborg.</p>
<p>That's not to say that she's the Terminator. Nor even that she's the

herself a cyborg because she sleeps with a breathing machine. At night,
she wears a mask over her nose to force air into her lungs.</p>
