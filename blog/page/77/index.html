<p>I don&#8217;t, as a rule, pay a great deal of attention to Canadian politics.
I was vaguely aware that something unusual is going on there this week.
Then Emma pointed me to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yarnharlot.ca/blog/archives/2008/12/03/what_is_happening_in_canada.html">Yarn Harlot</a>&#8216;s ex&shy;pla&shy;na&shy;tion
of what&#8217;s&nbsp;happened.</p>
<p>In brief, for the last two years,
Stephen Harper&#8217;s minority government has been playing
a high-stakes game, repeatedly forcing the opposition parties
to either vote with him or force an election, which they
would likely&nbsp;lose.</p>
<p>Last week, as soon as Parliament resumed after October&#8217;s general election,
Harper put forth an &quot;economic strategy&quot;, which included removing
federal election subsidies to all par&shy;ties—&shy;ef&shy;fec&shy;tive&shy;ly hobbling the opposition.
The opposition were deeply unhappy about that,
and also about the <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/05/Proroguery.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Emma worked at WaMu as a software tester for three years.
I&#8217;m sure that if she were still there, she&#8217;d be one of them.
Most of her friends from that time have moved on;

<p>A few years ago, WaMu seemed too big to fail.
Now? Circling the toilet&nbsp;bowl.</p>
<p>Our whole economy seems like it was one giant Ponzi scheme,

It&#8217;s hard to tell how much was wilful ignorance,

<p>I look out the window.
Driz&shy;zling—not too heavy—I&#8217;ll ride to work.
Pack my clothes into the panier bag.
Spandex tights, coat, yellow jacket, helmet, gloves: on they go.
Bike&#8217;s in the garage, seems okay, slap on the bag.
Pull it out, reset the odometer.
17 minutes&nbsp;today?</p>
<p>Ignite the blinky lights, pull away.
Down the side roads, until I&#8217;m compelled to take the arterial.
Press the crosswalk button, wait for a break in the traffic.
Two minutes, three, does this fucking light <em>ever</em> change?
Off like a shot, past Jefferson Park.
Maybe they&#8217;ll finish by next summer.
Hit the next light at 2:30.
A long, gentle uphill for the next 8 minutes.

<p>There&#8217;s little that I miss about Irish cooking.
One notable exception is Brown Bread aka Brown Soda Bread.
I don&#8217;t know of any bakery that makes it in the States,
though I&#8217;ve found it at a couple of Irish pubs.
The main difficulty in making it is
finding the coarse-ground wholemeal flour.
The usual fine-ground stuff has the wrong&nbsp;texture.</p>
<p>I know of only one place in the Seattle area that carries
the right flour and that&#8217;s
The Grainery, 13629 1st Ave S, Burien, <span class="caps">WA</span> 98168; (206) 244-5015.
I bought some flour there today,
made a loaf, and brought the loaf and a 10lb bag of flour
to an Irish friend&#8217;s birthday&nbsp;party.</p>

<p>Perusing Eric S. Raymond&#8217;s blog recently,
I noticed his <a class="reference external" href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=578">claim</a> that as a one-time maintainer of <span class="caps">GIFLIB</span>,
just about <em>every</em> cellphone and browser has some of his software

<p>That got me thinking about my own reach and
where software that I&#8217;ve con&shy;tributed to can be&nbsp;found.</p>

By any measure, that&#8217;s a successful product,

<p>My first Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing took place nineteen years ago.
I was a 24-year-old graduate student,
recently arrived at Brown.
One of my of&shy;fice&shy;mates and her husband insisted
that I and a Swedish grad student
accompany them to her parents&#8217; house for Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing dinner.
It snowed that day, the first snow of the winter.
We set off in what seemed like a blizzard,
up I-95 into Mass&shy;a&shy;chu&shy;setts.
The day was cold, but the reception was warm.
A houseful of Patrice&#8217;s relatives made us most&nbsp;welcome.</p>
<p>Ever since, I&#8217;ve always sat down to
a large, convivial dinner at Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing.
At first, others welcomed me into their homes.
For the last decade, Emma and I have played host
to others <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/11/28/GivingThanks.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

How to Carve a Turkey
</div><p>Just in case you need some tips for tomorrow&#8217;s&nbsp;feast.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re hosting a dinner.
My Irish friends, Paul and Maggie,
who moved to San Jose at the end of last year,
have come up for a few days.
It will be their first Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing together in the States.
We&#8217;ll also be joined by Frank <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Lyndol,
Raven <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Iain, and Peter <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Carol.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re cooking the turkey at high heat,
using Barbara Kafka&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bkafka.com/Recipes/roastturkey.html">500F recipe</a>.
The others are bringing everything else.&nbsp;Yum.</p>

It&#8217;s my primary home machine,
sitting on the living room coffee table,

<p>But it rarely leaves the house.
It&#8217;s big–a 17&quot; screen–and it&#8217;s heavy.
I seldom carry it anywhere and I hardly ever bring it to a coffee&nbsp;shop.</p>
