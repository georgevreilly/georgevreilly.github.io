<p>When we moved to Beacon Hill in 2000,
we were totally dumb&shy;found&shy;ed by the number of kids
who came trick-or-treating to our door.
In the prior two years, we had been renting a house in Walling&shy;ford,
and we had only had one set of kids each year.</p>
<p>We had about 100 kids that first year.
We were not expecting the onslaught and ran out of candy,
which led to Emma being berated by some pre&shy;sump&shy;tu&shy;ous mother.
We live in a relatively affluent block
and kids are brought quite a distance to partake of the goodies.
One small boy peered up at Emma once and asked her, “Are you rich?”</p>

<p>I saw Green&shy;stage's production of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.greenstage.org/2009/titus">Titus Andronicus</a> on Sunday night.
Normally, this is Shake&shy;speare's bloodiest tragedy,
but Greenstage chose to play it as a dark comedy.
It's still bloody, extremely bloody, blood everywhere,
spurting from severed wrists,
spraying from cut throats,
shooting over the stage
(and some of the audience).</p>
<p>The first twenty minutes were very confusing.
The actors spoke their lines very quickly and I had a hard time
tuning in to what they were saying and what was happening.
Then either they slowed down or I tuned in,
but it started making sense,
inasmuch as Titus Andronicus can ever make sense.</p>
<p>I've seen Greenstage do comedies and straight tragedies.
Here they hammed it <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/10/28/TitusAndronicus.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I spent last Wednesday at Benaroya Hall,
attending the Seattle edition of Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow's traveling <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-developer-days-conference/">DevDays conference</a>.
It was well worth $99.</p>
<p>Joel Spolsky, owner of FogCreek Software and co-founder of Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow,
opened the conference with a keynote about the
dichotomy of power and simplicity.
People are happier when not over&shy;whelmed with choices.
Many of the choices that software forces users to make
are es&shy;sen&shy;tial&shy;ly mean&shy;ing&shy;less to the users.
However, even though people want simplicity, they also want features
and different people use different features.
Powerful software sells more copies.</p>
<p>He argues that developers and designers should put in the extra work to make good choices
on behalf of the users: don't make users <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/10/26/StackOverflowDevDaysSeattle2009.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>As part of my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/10/15/GittingAlong.aspx">personal conversion to Git</a>, I read Swice&shy;good's Git book.
It's a decent in&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;tion to Git and you learn how to
do all the basic tasks as well as some more advanced topics.
The examples are clear and well-paced.</p>
<p>I would have liked to see more about col&shy;lab&shy;o&shy;ra&shy;tion and workflow in a DVCS world,
perhaps a few case studies:
how is Git used in the Linux kernel de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment process;
how a small, dis&shy;trib&shy;uted team uses Git and GitHub;
how a collocated team migrates from more tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al tools.</p>

Malcolm Gladwell writes of the rather startling findings
concerning brain damage that American foot&shy;ballers sustain over their careers.</p>
<p>The constant butting of heads leads to an
enormously high rate of chronic traumatic en&shy;cephalopa&shy;thy (C.T.E.),
which has symptoms like Alzheimer's.
It's not just the con&shy;cus&shy;sions that cause it,
but all the sub&shy;con&shy;cus&shy;sive contact.
It's almost as dangerous to one's long-term health as boxing.</p>
<p>I grew up <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/03/21/RugbyGrandSlam.aspx">hating rugby</a> and trans&shy;ferred that hatred to American football.
I have no time for the game, which I find violent and repellent,
nor for the jock culture that surrounds it.</p>

<p>Nathan Oliver is a great writer, but a horrible man.
Adam Dalgleish of Scotland Yard is called in when Oliver is found murdered
on an island that is ex&shy;clu&shy;sive&shy;ly reserved for VIPs.
Only a handful of people could possibly be the killer.</p>
<p>P.D. James adds psy&shy;cho&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal insight to a tightly plotted classic mystery.
Dalgleish is both a poet and a detective.
Both aspects are required to get to the heart of what happened on Combe Island.</p>

<p>William Gibson has abandoned cyberspace for the present day.
No matter.
The same elements of paranoia, adrenalin, and tech&shy;nos&shy;peak are present.</p>
<p>His story follows three sets of characters,
all of whom ultimately intersect, chasing the same mcguffin.</p>
<p>Enjoyable, if confusing.</p>
