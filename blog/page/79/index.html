<p>Emma had a chance to play with Jacob’s Kindle (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA">Amazon</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle">Wikipedia</a>) today,
while I looked on.</p>
<p>The electronic paper screen is one of the big selling points.
We found the text to be very readable, albeit black-and-white.
It works very well for its primary use case—dis­play­ing
book pages with minimal battery drain—but it’s sluggish when updating menus.</p>
<p>I’m not impressed by the design of the case.
The buttons on the side are far too big;
the keyboard at the bottom is ridiculous.
It would be in­ter­est­ing to see what Apple could do.</p>
<p>I’ve been using <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexcycle_Stanza">Stanza</a> on my iPhone for the last couple of months,
mostly to read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.feedbooks.com/book/228">Ac­celeran­do</a> on the bus.

<p>Since the summer, I’ve been working on and off on a mobile site for Cozi.
Chris, one of our interns, did a lot of the initial work.
Getting it to a deployable state has
been my primary focus over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>I’m happy to say that as of today <a class="reference external" href="http://m.cozi.com/">m.cozi.com</a> is in public beta.
Will wrote a little about it at the <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.cozi.com/coziblog/2008/12/cozi-mobile.html">Cozi Blog</a>;
take a look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cozi.com/Promo-Cozi-Mobile.htm">promo</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, the mobile site supports shopping lists and the calendar.
In the calendar, you can view, create, and edit your ap­point­ments.

<p>We’ve gone high-def over the last month.
First, Emma bought a <a class="reference external" href="http://www2.panasonic.com/consumer-electronics/support/Televisions/VIERA-Plasma-HDTVs/model.TH-42PZ80U.S">42" 1080p plasma Panasonic <span class="caps">HDTV</span></a>
to replace the 32" <span class="caps">CRT</span> <span class="caps">TV</span> in our living room.
Although it’s wider, it’s not over­whelm­ing,
as the slender box sits further back.
The picture’s pretty good—at least when you give it a good signal.</p>
<p>To take advantage of it required a cascade of upgrades.
Our old TiVo served us well for eight years;
ap­point­ment <span class="caps">TV</span> has long been alien to us.
It’s dis­con­nect­ed now, replaced the other day
by a DirecTV Plus <span class="caps">DVR</span> and a new satellite dish.
I had heard bad things about the older DirecTV DVRs,
but I have no complaints about this one yet.</p>

<p>Be careful what you say:

<p>Eric had the temerity last week to <a class="reference external" href="http://offby1-whining.blogspot.com/2008/12/pentaho.html">gripe</a> on his blog
about a certain open source business in­tel­li­gence product,
and got swarmed by irate defenders.
Apparently he showed up in their Google Alerts.
Some of the posters were helpful,
but the <em>ad hominem</em> attackers were more en­ter­tain­ing:</p>
<blockquote>
Your blog has had 22 posts in the past year, and your blogroll includes
absolutely no one of note in the open source world. So I think it’s
safe to say that while you are pointing out a perception that they
should address in some way, that your opinion isn’t worth much.</blockquote>

<p>In a footnote to the post about <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2008/11/08/NoOnProposition8.html">Propo­si­tion 8</a> on November 7th,
I said that it was the first in a series of daily posts for <a class="reference external" href="http://nablopomo.ning.com/">NaBloPoMo</a>,
the National Blog Posting Month, which I had just found out about.</p>
<p>Here I am a month later, having posted something every single evening.
I covered humor; movie and book reviews; being the #1 tech blog (now #2);
politics; Thanks­giv­ing; food; personal stuff; and even some technical posts. Whew!</p>
<p>Why bother? As with the two-year-old exercise in book reviews,
it was a personal challenge to come up with a post every single evening
for a month.

<p>We saw a production of David Sedaris’s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattlepublictheater.org/events-santaland.htm">Santaland Diaries</a>
at the Bathhouse Theater tonight. Funny stuff.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we walked over to the Greenlake Bluwater Restaurant
to get a spot of dinner.
We both ordered Tuscan White Bean soup for a starter,
Emma had the Turkey Pot Pie,
and mine was the Fettucine.</p>
<p>The soup was fine and my fettucine was okay.
Emma’s pot pie had problems.
The potatoes were raw and it had a funny lemony aftertaste.
She pushed the plate away and waited for the waitress to come by.
The waitress apologized and brought Emma the menu.
Emma opted for the meatloaf, since that would come quickly.
The manager apologized and offered us a <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/07/CantTakeHerAnywhere.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Simon Canderous, dorky newbie at the un­der­fund­ed, secretive
Department of Ex­tra­or­di­nary Affairs in New York City,
in­ves­ti­gates the death of a beautiful ghost
and the apparently re­spectable cultists at the
Sectarian Defense League.
He has the gift (or curse) of psy­chom­e­try:
when he touches something,
he can divine its history.</p>
<p>This book wobbles between not very black comedy
and straight urban fantasy,
and doesn’t really succeed as either.</p>

<p>I don’t, as a rule, pay a great deal of attention to Canadian politics.
I was vaguely aware that something unusual is going on there this week.
Then Emma pointed me to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yarnharlot.ca/blog/archives/2008/12/03/what_is_happening_in_canada.html">Yarn Harlot</a>‘s ex­pla­na­tion
of what’s happened.</p>
<p>In brief, for the last two years,
Stephen Harper’s minority government has been playing
a high-stakes game, repeatedly forcing the opposition parties
to either vote with him or force an election, which they
would likely lose.</p>
<p>Last week, as soon as Parliament resumed after October’s general election,
Harper put forth an "economic strategy", which included removing
federal election subsidies to all par­ties—­ef­fec­tive­ly hobbling the opposition.
The opposition were deeply unhappy about that,
and also about the <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/05/Proroguery.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
