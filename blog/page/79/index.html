<p>When my parents visited me in September,
I bought them a second laptop and an external drive for backup.
One laptop stays in Dublin,
the other in Cape Town where they spend much of their year.
Both laptops are in Dublin with me at present,
so that I can clean them up and get them in sync.
(I had to remove some very obscure registry settings to
get one <span class="caps">DVD</span> drive working again.&nbsp;&lt;sigh/&gt;)</p>
<p>Their backup needs are simple.
Both of them have web-based email at Yahoo!.
The only personal data on either computer is photos.
Inevitably the photos are out of sync between the two&nbsp;machines.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">WD</span> Passport drive came with WDSync,

<p>2008 closes, leaving economic wreckage in its wake.
Personally and pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly, it&#8217;s been a good year.
At the national level, it&#8217;s been both a very good year and a disastrous one.
Obama&#8217;s historic victory is offset by the imploding&nbsp;economy.</p>
<p>My health remains good, I&#8217;m a little fitter than I was a year ago.
I&#8217;ve notched up a few personal milestones,
such as receiving my Competent Com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tor award at Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters and
becoming the secretary of Freely Speaking&nbsp;Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters.</p>
<p>My friends and family are, mostly, doing well.
My sister is (still!) on the verge of having her first child.

The hunch&shy;backed lawyer Matthew Shardlake
has been sent to York by Archbishop Cranmer to meet the Royal Progress,
where Henry <span class="caps">VIII</span> is to accept formal surrender from those
who had earlier rebelled.
Shardlake is to hear petitions on the king&#8217;s behalf,
but really he is there to ensure that a high-ranking con&shy;spir&shy;a&shy;tor
is brought safely back to the Tower of London.
He stumbles upon a cache of secret papers,

Her baby is now nine days overdue

<p>It&#8217;s been very hard to hook up with my old friends here.
We landed seven days ago and the only other meet up
was a couple of pints with Jimmy on Monday.
They&#8217;re (almost) all middle-aged, mortgaged, married, and bechilded,
and otherwise busy with their own lives.

<p>When I was a boy, anytime we said ‘Dundrum’ (a suburb of Dublin),
it was with a snigger, because it was synonymous in our minds
with the <a class="reference external" href="http://wikimapia.org/72462/Central-Mental-Hospital-Dundrum">mental asylum</a> located there.
Nowadays, Dundrum is much better known as the home of a large
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dundrum.ie/">shopping centre</a>.
I&#8217;m so out of touch with Dublin that I hadn&#8217;t realized
that there was a major new shopping centre there.
I assumed that people were talking about the unim&shy;pres&shy;sive
little centre that I remembered there from my childhood.
Until today, when we went there to return the
mobile phone that we had given my mother for&nbsp;Christmas.</p>
<p>Dundrum was, indeed, a madhouse.

<p>Normally, we have Shuttle Express take us to Sea-Tac airport,
but they were completely booked up when I tried to make a reser&shy;va&shy;tion
earlier in the week.
Lyndol very kindly came over at 6am and drove us down to the&nbsp;airport.</p>
<p>Our plane left an hour late from Seattle,
as it came in late the night before
and the crew had to wait for the statutory <span class="caps">FTC</span> minimum stopover.
The late departure from Seatac was no problem,
since we had a scheduled 5-hour layover in Philadelpia.
After being shoehorned into the plane,
we needed to stretch and wandered through several of the terminals.
The only excitement was when I realized an hour <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2008/12/21/InDublin.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I tried to take the bus into work today, but no bus showed.
I later learned that the #39 had been “tem&shy;porar&shy;i&shy;ly suspended”.
Emma drove into downtown Seattle, getting off at the James St. exit.
James is steep and it was closed to traffic.
She let me out at 7th and James and
I walked down to the Smith&nbsp;Tower.</p>
<p>Other people were <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/392969_bus20.html">not so lucky</a> on the steeper streets,

<p>When we went to bed on Wednesday night, most of the weekend&#8217;s snow had melted.
We were woken around 5:30am by two large <a class="reference external" href="http://beaconhill.seattle.wa.us/2008/12/18/did-you-hear-that/">thunder claps</a>,
attributed to <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/392821_storm19.html">thun&shy;der&shy;snow</a>.
The snow was falling again and fell for most of the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>We were sensible and stayed home.
So, it seems, did almost everyone else at Cozi.
I worked remotely for part of the day.
Otherwise, we watched movies.
I felt no desire to go outside and make snowmen,
though we certainly could&nbsp;have.</p>
<p>We fly to Ireland on Saturday morning.
I&#8217;m a little worried about getting to the&nbsp;airport.</p>
