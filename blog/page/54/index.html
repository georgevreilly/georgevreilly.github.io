<p>I took today off and headed north to the Skagit Valley with Emma and Lyndol
to see the tulips.
It was a glorious spring day,
sunny, not too warm, a light breeze.
The tulip fields were busy for a weekday;
they're completely overrun at the weekends.</p>
<p>We wandered around <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tuliptown.com/">Tulip Town</a> for an hour,
had lunch in La Conner,
and headed back to Seattle via Camano Island.</p>
<p>We had intended to take <a class="reference external" href="http://www.byways.org/explore/byways/2579/stories/67281">Chuckanut Drive</a> up to Fairhaven,
but Emma wasn't feeling well.
Some other time.
Chuckanut Drive is pretty year round;
the tulips are good only for another couple of weeks.</p>

<p>I gave a poetry reading tonight, of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/01/07/FrankRAJMaloney19452009.aspx">Frank Maloney</a>'s poems.
I'm working through a book of In&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;tive Reading projects
at Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters.
I had to read some poetry for tonight's project
and Frank's work was an obvious choice.
(Had I remembered, I would have recorded the reading and made a podcast.)</p>
<p>Frank was most active as a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Richard_Maloney_(poet)">poet</a> in the 1970s when he published
his collection, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Eat-Slug-Frank-Maloney/dp/0914742140/">How to Eat a Slug</a>.</p>
<p>Six poems follow that give a taste of his work.
The material in [square brackets] I omitted from the reading.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-illiterate-calligrapher">
<h2>The Illiterate Cal&shy;lig&shy;ra&shy;ph&shy;er</h2>
<p>Frank was long interested in Chinese and Japanese art
and he used to paint wa&shy;ter&shy;col&shy;ors.</p>

<p>There are two Dr. Temperance Brennan's.
Both are forensic an&shy;thro&shy;pol&shy;o&shy;gists.
One is the heroine of Kathy Reichs' novels,
who, like Reichs herself, is a professor in North Carolina
and works with the Montreal police.
The other is the star of the TV show, <em>Bones</em>,
is brilliant but devoid of social skills,
works with the FBI in Washington DC,
and has a state-of-the-art lab and a crack team of geeks.</p>
<p>A war has erupted between biker gangs in Montreal.
Old bones have been found in the ground,

<p>I fear going into my home office.
It's a huge mess of clutter,
books piled everywhere, boxes of unsorted papers,
crap all over my desk.
(No, it's not as bad as the ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;ny&shy;ing photo.)</p>
<p>My office overwhelms me.
As a result, I don't go in there,
except to drop more stuff off and make it worse.
I rarely use the desktop system there.</p>
<p>The living room couch has become my sub-office.
I sit there of an evening and surf the web from my laptop.
I pull out the bills every couple of weeks
and take care of them from the couch.
Then I dump them in the office.</p>
<p>I know what the solution is.

<p>One app that I really want for my iPhone is <a class="reference external" href="http://ikeepass.de/">iKeePass</a>,
an port of the <a class="reference external" href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> password safe.
I've mentioned it <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2006/02/06/200KeePassEntries.aspx">before</a>.
I'm up to about 400 entries now.
It's completely in&shy;dis&shy;pens&shy;able to me for keeping track
of not just passwords, but identities,
and which websites I've registered on.</p>
<p>Apple is holding up approval of iKeePass, apparently in&shy;def&shy;i&shy;nite&shy;ly.
It seems to be some com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion of not wanting
to approve strong encryption for export
and hangups about open source.
Or something.
Whatever it is, it's damned annoying.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a> works on Mac and Linux and means that I can move
my password database back and forth to Windows without problem.

<p>I spent part of my day fighting with CSS for an email template.
CSS support is poor in both desktop and web clients,
and much worse than in current browsers.</p>
<p>Gmail, for example, does not support <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;style&gt;</tt>
in either the head or the body of HTML email.
You have to explicitly set <tt class="docutils literal">style</tt> attributes on individual nodes.
You might as well be using <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;font&gt;</tt> tags!</p>
<p>You can't assume that images will be downloaded,
so the mail has to make sense without them.
And forget iframes.</p>
<p>Cam&shy;paign&shy;Mon&shy;i&shy;tor seems to have the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/">definitive guide to CSS support</a>.</p>

<p>Seven years ago, “Paul Hardy” was found with his head smashed in.
He recovered physically, but not mentally.
After another accident, his wits come back and a few memories.
Googling for the one name he remembers brings the NSA to his door.
He goes on the run, causing the un&shy;rav&shy;el&shy;ling of a coverup.</p>
<p>Efficient, well-plotted thriller in the paranoid vein.
The plot is as risible as most such books, but no matter.
Enjoy it for a few hours.</p>

<p>I like paying taxes. With them I buy civ&shy;i&shy;liza&shy;tion.</p>

<p>The accountant completed our return last night.
Usually we have something of a rebate,
so the amount that we owed came as an unwelcome surprise.
It's paid now.
Bah!</p>
<p>I pay taxes willing enough, but “like” is too strong.
We cannot run a complex society without taxes.
There are many functions that the vaunted free market performs poorly if at all:
roads, sewers, schools, police, health care, education, defense, emer&shy;gen&shy;cies.
The profit motive is at odds with providing good, dis&shy;pas&shy;sion&shy;ate service.
Government doesn't nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;i&shy;ly do it well either,
especially when it's run by people who are ide&shy;o&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly opposed to taxes.

<p>A Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters meeting has three parts:
prepared speeches, table topics, and eval&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tions of the prepared speeches.</p>
<p>Table Topics offer a chance for those present
to wing it on some topic for one or two minutes.
The Table Topics Master sets up the topics
and the speaker has as most a few minutes to prepare.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I'm running Table Topics,
I present a topic for everyone at the beginning of the section.
On a winter's day, I might ask people to tell us about
some favorite food they associate with winter.
Or I might ask them to tell us about where they're going for their summer vacation.</p>

<p>Anathem takes place on Arbre,
a world where those of an in&shy;tel&shy;lec&shy;tu&shy;al bent
sequester themselves in monas&shy;ter&shy;ies apart from the Sæcular world.
When an alien ship is noticed orbiting the planet,
avout from concents all over Arbre are drawn together for a Convox
to determine how to respond to the threat of the Geometers.</p>
<p>Stephen&shy;son's <em>Anathem</em> is an ambitious project,
pulling together physics, meta&shy;physics, world-building, an&shy;thro&shy;pol&shy;o&shy;gy,
and an adventure tale.
It's an alien world as he keeps reminding us
by the huge vocabulary he's invented.
Said vocabulary alternates between ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ing and en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing,
