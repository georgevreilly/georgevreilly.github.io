<p>This morning, the video adapters on my Vista dev box were resetting
2–3&nbsp;times per <em>minute</em>.</p>
<p>After a pile of Windows Updates landed on my machine at 3am yesterday,
it would oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly freeze solid for a few seconds.
Once in a while, all the monitors would go black briefly, then restore.
Each time, I would see a status update pop up from the system tray,
&quot;Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly&nbsp;recovered.&quot;</p>
<p>This was irritating enough that I downloaded the latest NVidia drivers this morning,
<tt class="docutils literal">185.85_desk&shy;top_win&shy;vis&shy;ta_32bit_eng&shy;lish_whql.exe</tt>.
That really screwed me.
The video adapters started resetting 2–3 times per minute,
rendering the machine almost unusable.
I have two video adapters, NVidia GeForce 8600 <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/06/12/DisplayDriverNvlddmkmStoppedRespondingAndHasSuccessfullyRecovered.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p><em>Ob&shy;jec&shy;ti&shy;fied</em> is a doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary about industrial design
and the man&shy;u&shy;fac&shy;tured objects that litter our lives.
In interviews with some leading designers,
Hustwit brings forth such topics as
our emotional attachment to those objects;
the ephemer&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ty and planned ob&shy;soles&shy;ence of most of this “stuff”;
the approaches of different designers;
designing the man&shy;u&shy;fac&shy;tur&shy;ing process as well as the object;
how good design often almost dis&shy;ap&shy;pears;
sus&shy;tain&shy;abil&shy;i&shy;ty, when most objects end up in landfill;
in&shy;ter&shy;ac&shy;tion and interface design;&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>The danger with such a broad survey
is that you can&#8217;t do justice to anything.
I was left wanting to know more about many of the topics.

<p>I just sent out the Evite for Frank&#8217;s memorial on July 5th.
If you didn&#8217;t receive a copy and you&#8217;d like to go, let me&nbsp;know.</p>
<p>Next up, choose the poems and music.
We may reprise some of those that <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/04/20/ReadingFranksPoems.html">I read at Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters</a>.
Certainly, we should read “How to Eat a&nbsp;Slug”.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most ir&shy;refutable sign of middle age for me
was getting <a class="reference external" href="http://www.allaboutvision.com/over40/progressive.htm">pro&shy;gres&shy;sive lenses</a> six months&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p>I had noticed for several months that I was having a little difficulty with smaller print,
and a visit to the op&shy;tometrist confirmed that I needed reading glasses.
Now I&#8217;m near-sighted and far-sighted, all at the same&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The new glasses took some getting used to.
I had been accustomed to looking through any part of the lens.
Now I had to tilt my head downwards rather than simply turn my eyes down,
if I wanted to look at the floor,
or I&#8217;d be looking through the short-distance reading&nbsp;portion.</p>
<p>These lenses are also noticeably heavier <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/06/08/ProgressiveLenses.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

Twenty acres of hills and valleys in a Japanese&nbsp;style.</p>
<p>Emma and I met Lyndol down there this morning
and rambled through the garden for two hours.
It was a fine, overcast day, with tem&shy;per&shy;a&shy;tures in the low 60s and occasional driz&shy;zle—and a pleasant relief from the record heat of earlier this week.
I had visited there before:
it&#8217;s at the far end of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/transportation/chiefsealthtrail.htm">Chief Sealth bicycle trail</a>.
Lyn had too, but it was Emma&#8217;s first&nbsp;visit.</p>

dis&shy;tin&shy;guish&shy;ing it from syntactic punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion.
The latter, says he, is the style taught in schools,
where the punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion cor&shy;re&shy;sponds to gram&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal phrase structure.
Elo&shy;cu&shy;tion&shy;ary punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion treats punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion as
markers of speech cadence and&nbsp;intonation.</p>
<p>I think I fall in this camp.
I&#8217;m careful about my punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion,
though I can&#8217;t nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;i&shy;ly articulate
why I choose one way over another.
If it <em>sounds</em> right in my head, that&#8217;s the way I go.
Even before I started doing staged readings,
I paid attention to how my writing would sound,
were it read&nbsp;aloud.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m pon&shy;tif&shy;i&shy;cat&shy;ing on punc&shy;tu&shy;a&shy;tion,

I&#8217;ve tried it on my <span class="caps">OS</span>&nbsp;10.5 MacBook and my Ubuntu Jaunty Netbook Remix&nbsp;netbook.</p>
<p>Chrome works fairly well, so far.
It seems slow at resolving hostnames,
but otherwise downloads pages quickly.
Rendering speed is good.
Gmail comes up in an amazingly short time, as in Windows Chrome.
It uses less <span class="caps">CPU</span> than Safari or&nbsp;Camino.</p>
<p>Favicons are not showing up in tabs on Mac.
Fonts are not an&shy;tialiased on&nbsp;Linux.</p>
<p>As a user, I&#8217;m happy to see that there is real com&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;tion between the browsers

<p>Frank Maloney was a longtime regular in this newsgroup.
After a long illness, he died on January 6th, 2009 at his&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>Some of Frank&#8217;s friends are helping Lyndol,
his partner of more than 30 years,
to put together a memorial for Frank.
It&#8217;ll be held near Seattle on the afternoon of July&nbsp;5th.</p>
<p>Frank was a published poet and we&#8217;ll be reading some of his poems.
But he also spent more than 20 years par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pat&shy;ing in newsgroups,
posted thousands of articles, and made many online friends.
It seems fitting for us to read some of his voluminous&nbsp;output.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like your help.
