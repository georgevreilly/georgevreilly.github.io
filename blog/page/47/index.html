<p>A front group for Big Oil is <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/05/18/new-ads-funded-by-big-oil-portray-global-warming-science-as-smear-campaign-against-carbon-dioxide/">putting out ads</a>

to undermine Al Gore's new doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary,

The first ad portrays global warming science as a vicious smear campaign

<p>I remember about two years ago, before a trip across the Atlantic, trying
to find websites that had street maps for London and Dublin -- and coming
up nearly empty.</p>
<p>Now, a year after it became available, I notice that Google Maps
covers <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.co.uk">Ireland and the UK</a>.
Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, it does a piss-poor job of finding locations:
try typing anything more specific than <em>Dublin</em> into the search box.</p>
<p>Google Maps now provides a basic ability to get directions
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.spatialireland.com/archives/20060425-google-maps-adds-basic-directions-for-the-republic/">between cities</a>.</p>

<p>I saw a video clip of so-called
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2684760?htv=12">Russian Climbing</a>
at work today. It turns out that it's an extreme sport of French origin
called <a class="reference external" href="http://parkour.net/index.php?sel_lang=english">Parkour</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/fundamentals/fundamentals.htm">Free Running</a>.</p>
<p>Parkour is &quot;the art of forward motion in spite of obstacles&quot;. Its
prac&shy;ti&shy;tion&shy;ers (traceurs) run around urban landscapes, performing Jacky
Chan-like leaps, rolls, stunts, jumps, and flips.</p>
<p>The excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/">How&shy;Stuff&shy;Works.com</a>
has a good <a class="reference external" href="http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/parkour.htm">in&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;to&shy;ry piece on Parkour</a>.</p>
<p>There is a local group of traceurs, who are written up in a
<a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/252602_parkour19.html">P-I article</a>.
Their website is <a class="reference external" href="http://washingtonparkour.com/">Washington Parkour</a>.

    <p>I hang out on the Source&shy;Forge-hosted
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.inkscape.org/mailing_lists.php">inkscape-user</a> mailing list,
where I pick up useful tips for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>
SVG editor (vector drawing program).</p>
<p>For months, the list has been plagued with spam; largely because anyone can
send to the list. The policy has been not to require new users to sign up
for the list before being able to send questions. This is com&shy;mend&shy;ably
friendly and user-centric, but the spam has become a real annoyance.</p>
<p>One of the Inkscape developers finally said that, if a dozen or more people
said &quot;yes, restrict posting to list members only&quot; and no-one opposed it, he
would lock the list down. I attempted to <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/05/04/TheIroniesOfSpam.html.." class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

but the SketchUp UI is easier to use and more functional,
and it runs on a regular PC instead of a high-end Unix work&shy;sta&shy;tion.</p>
<p>I can see myself using SketchUp to model wood&shy;work&shy;ing projects.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite shows is back on the TiVo.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbqu.net/">Barbecue University</a> is
Steven Raichlen's show about all kinds of
grilling and barbecue techniques and recipes.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="http://www.recipecircus.com/recipes/Magnolias/BBQ/Afghan-Style_Game_Hens.html">Afghan Game Hens</a>,
although I always substitute chicken(s) for the game hens.
This recipe convinced me to buy a rotisserie.
It's been a huge hit whenever I've served it up.
It's not the easiest meal to prepare, so I don't do it often.
Note: I cook the marinaded onions in a pan and serve them with the chicken.
Yum!</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://splendidtable.publicradio.org/recipes/main_beercan.shtml">Beer Can Chicken</a>,
on the other hand, is very easy.
It also works well in the oven.

    <p>I often complain about being busy, no doubt because I have a talent for
com&shy;pli&shy;cat&shy;ing my life. Things were relatively quiet for a while, but that's
not true anymore.</p>
<p>At work, we're close to releasing the first version of our product.
Happily, crunch time at Atlas isn't nearly as bad as it was at Microsoft.
Instead of working eight-ish hours a day, it's more like nine or maybe ten.
The pressure level has risen, of course, but it's far from in&shy;tol&shy;er&shy;a&shy;ble.</p>
<p>The real busyness is in my ex&shy;tracur&shy;ric&shy;u&shy;lar life. I'm the president of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.BiNetSeattle.org">BiNet Seattle</a>, a bisexual community group,

    <p>I was born 41 years ago today. (Tech&shy;ni&shy;cal&shy;ly, yesterday, as it's now the early hours
of March 16th.) I was to have been called Vincent after my father, but my mother's
father, George Victor Clery, had died just 12 days before. I was baptised
George Vincent Reilly on March 17th, St. Patrick's Day.</p>
<p>Beware the Ides of March, I tell people: You might have to buy George a present.
Better a birthday present than the reception that Julius Caesar received on
