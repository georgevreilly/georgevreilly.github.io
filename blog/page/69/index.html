<p>Bay Tanner is a young widow and aspiring private in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tor
from wealthy South Carolina stock.
When a hitherto unknown <a class="reference external" href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-shi5.htm">shirt-tail</a> cousin (fifth half cousin, specif&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly)
bursts into Bay&#8217;s life, she brings havoc in her&nbsp;train.</p>
<p>As one of the characters says,
the plot sounds like a made-for-<span class="caps">TV</span> movie.
Still, Bay is a feisty heroine and
the background is not one that has been mined&nbsp;deeply.</p>

<p>We were watching <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHXBL6bzAR4">An Engineer&#8217;s Guide to Cats</a> on YouTube
when I looked out the front window and spotted these two looking in.
They climbed up the six-foot gooseberry frames to the&nbsp;windowsill.</p>
<p>Meet Whiskey and Guinness, from next door.
They think they own the place.
When it&#8217;s hot in the summer, they&#8217;ve been known to stroll in
and wander around our living room—while we&#8217;re in&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I left the back door open for a few minutes one Saturday morning,
while packing the car.
I came back in and found Whiskey just inside the back room.
He scarpered when I yelled at him and I slammed the door behind him.

<p>We saw <em>The Seafarer</em> at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seattlereptickets.org/Plays/0809/SF/">Seattle Rep</a> this afternoon.
Two brothers, Richard and Sharkey, share a house in north Dublin.
There&#8217;s little love lost between them.
Richard, recently blinded, is con&shy;trol&shy;ling and wheedling.
Sharkey is trying to stay off the gargle
and it&#8217;s not easy when Richard and his crony Ivan drink like&nbsp;fishes.</p>
<p>Sharkey&#8217;s old rival, Nicky, arrives on Christmas Eve,
bringing a stranger with him, Mr. Lockhart.
They settle down to a game of poker
and Sharkey privately learns that he&#8217;s met the stranger once before.
For Mr. Lockhart is the devil and he wants to collect the old debt

<p>Vim has had <a class="reference external" href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html">syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing</a> since version 5.0 in 1998.
It quickly became in&shy;dis&shy;pens&shy;able.
It&#8217;s hard to go back to looking at mono&shy;chro&shy;mat&shy;ic source code
after you&#8217;ve become accustomed to syntax&nbsp;high&shy;light&shy;ing.</p>
<p>The syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing is tied into Vim&#8217;s support for col&shy;orschemes,
which define colors for the fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal syntax groups
like <tt class="docutils literal">Number</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Comment</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">String</tt>.
The syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing for a particular language
defines custom syntax groups for specific language features,
such as <tt class="docutils literal">cppEx&shy;cep&shy;tions</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">htmlEndTag</tt>,</p>
<p>The custom syntax groups are <em>linked</em> to the underlying fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal syntax groups.
Hence, if you change your col&shy;orscheme, your syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing is updated&nbsp;au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly.</p>
<p>The re&shy;Struc&shy;tured&shy;Text syntax high&shy;light&shy;ing in Vim 7.2
has some short&shy;com&shy;ings, in my opinion.
For example, <tt class="docutils literal">*italic*</tt> shows <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/07/reStructuredTextSyntaxHighlighting.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Answer: we do.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(film)">Watchmen movie</a>, that is.
Peter, Carol, Raven, Iain, Emma, and I are all going to see
the midnight initial showing at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pacsci.org/imax/">Pacific Science Center <span class="caps">IMAX</span></a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;ve ever been geeky enough to watch
the midnight opening of a movie before.
But it was Peter&#8217;s&nbsp;idea.</p>
<p>Peter and I shared an apartment in 1990–92 when we were both grad students at Brown,
and it was his copy of <em>Watchmen</em> that I first&nbsp;read.</p>
<p>And so the loop&nbsp;closes.</p>

<p>As promised <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/03/06/WhoWatchesTheWatchmen.html">yesterday</a>, we saw the initial midnight showing
of the <em>Watchmen</em> movie at the Pacific Science Center <span class="caps">IMAX</span>.
And, lo, the geeks came in their numbers
and they were greatly pleased.
Some were dressed as Rorschach,
one came as a smurf;
no, I lie, he was Dr.&nbsp;Manhattan.</p>
<p>I summarized the plot in my review of the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/02/22/ReviewWatchmenBook.html">book</a>.
That still holds: the movie was largely faithful to the book.
In many scenes, it was clear that the book had served as a storyboard.
Too faithful in some ways at 165 minutes long.
Some subplots were elim&shy;i&shy;nat&shy;ed;
no doubt they will resurface in <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/06/ReviewWatchmenFilm.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I knew three of my grand&shy;par&shy;ents; they all died after I reached adulthood.
My mother&#8217;s father, George Victor Clery, died 12 days before I was born,
on March 3rd, 1965.
I was to be named Vincent after my father, [Charles] Vincent Reilly.
Instead, I was christened George Vincent Reilly.
I was the first grandchild for both the Clerys and the Reillys.
I think I must have been a welcome&nbsp;dis&shy;trac&shy;tion.</p>
<p>Ironically, my parents had gotten married on his birthday,
March 30th, the previous year,
and he didn&#8217;t live to celebrate their first an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
The timing was partly in his honor
and partly because it was Easter Monday.
Catholics were not allowed to marry <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/03/03/GeorgeClery.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>A few years ago, after watching one too many whodunnit <span class="caps">TV</span> mysterys, I coined&nbsp;my</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>Law of Economy of&nbsp;Characters</em></dt>
<dd>The killer is in&shy;nocu&shy;ous&shy;ly introduced in the first 20&nbsp;minutes</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>In real life, the killer may not be known until late in the in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion—if&nbsp;ever.</p>
<p>In a <span class="caps">TV</span> mystery, any non-recurring character who gets more than a few lines
has to be a potential suspect—to the audience.
The character is not there gra&shy;tu&shy;itous&shy;ly.
Their salary is being paid for a&nbsp;reason.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uni&shy;ver&shy;sal&shy;ly true, but it works more often than not.
It&#8217;s less true in books, where throwaway characters are easy to&nbsp;introduce.</p>
<p>Googling around, I found the following, attributed to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=conservation+of+characters+ebert">Roger Ebert</a>:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>At lunch today, I told Eric about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec03/tech/full_papers/crosby/crosby.pdf">Hash Attacks</a>:
for many hash functions,
it&#8217;s possible to construct a large set of keys that collide.
This can be used to cause a Denial of Service
as hashtable operations can be induced
to take <em>O(n)</em> time instead of <em>O(1)</em>.</p>
<p>Crosby and Wallach suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly <a class="reference external" href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec03/tech/full_papers/crosby/crosby.pdf">demon&shy;strat&shy;ed</a> this
against a number of&nbsp;ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions.</p>
<p>Andrew has a good writeup of <a class="reference external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120318203841/http://www.team5150.com/~andrew/blog/2007/03/hash_algorithm_attacks.html">Hash Algorithm Attacks</a>.</p>
<p>There are various mit&shy;i&shy;ga&shy;tions suggested.
The one that I used when I first became aware of this problem
is to use a salt to the hash&nbsp;function.</p>
<p>In other words,&nbsp;change:</p>
<pre class="code C literal-block">
