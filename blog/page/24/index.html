    <p>I've always been an avid—nay, avari&shy;cious—read&shy;er of books.
But I have not been a listener of audiobooks.</p>
<p>I read quickly, much more quickly than anyone can speak,
and I enjoy burying my head in a book.
I've seen little reason, therefore, to listen to audiobooks.
Lately, however, we've listened to some audiobooks on long car trips,
as Emma, unlike me, has an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.audible.com/">Audible</a> sub&shy;scrip&shy;tion.
We enjoyed <a class="reference external" href="https://mobile.audible.com/pd/Mysteries-Thrillers/The-Hot-Rock-Audiobook/B003N9T8SA">The Hot Rock</a>, the first of the comic crime-caper <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dortmunder">Dortmunder</a> books.
Before that, I had read another Dortmunder novel, <em>Bank Shot</em>, aloud to Emma,
while she drove us back from Portland,
which both of us had enjoyed.</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Tony McLean of the Edinburgh Police has multiple deaths to deal with:
an elderly rich man, murdered horribly;
the newly discovered corpse of a girl killed in some ghoulish ritual sixty years ago;
and the the death of the grand&shy;moth&shy;er who raised him.
Then more elderly men start being murdered.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this police procedural and I liked the character of Tony McLean.
The two cases start dove&shy;tail&shy;ing together (one of my pet peeves)
and I was surprised when the author introduced su&shy;per&shy;nat&shy;ur&shy;al elements,

<p>We discovered <a class="reference external" href="http://www.adessobistro.net/">Adesso Bistro</a> just around the corner
from where we're staying in the West End of Vancouver.
It was very quiet tonight, with only one other table occupied while we were there
and another table leaving as we arrived.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the Prix Fixe menu of Gnocchi, Brasato (braised beef), and Panna Cotta.
Emma wasn't feeling too well,
so she had a light salad and half a mushroom pizza.
Both the food and the service were very good.
We'd certainly go again.</p>

    <p>We're spending a few days in Vancouver.
<em>The</em> Vancouver.
The Canadian city in British Columbia.
Not to be confused with the large Canadian island,
Vancouver Island, just a few miles away,
or the American city of Vancouver, Washington,
which is a suburb of Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>We like to come up to Vancouver a couple of times a year.
It's only 140 miles from Seattle,
but you have to cross the U.S.–Canadian border
and the highway runs out about ten miles from downtown Vancouver,
so it always takes at least three hours to drive up.</p>
<p>This time, we're staying on the edge of

in all his many in&shy;car&shy;na&shy;tions.
Emma and I are attending the 2015 convention this weekend at the Broadway Per&shy;for&shy;mance Hall.
We also attended the two previous con&shy;ven&shy;tions, in late 2012 and late 2013.
Holmes has always been popular,
since <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> wrote <em>A Study in Scarlet</em> in 1886.
Three recent adap&shy;ta&shy;tions have boosted Holmes' popularity con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;ably,

<p>Danny Boyle is growing up in Dublin in the 1960s and 1970s,
watched over by his grand&shy;moth&shy;er.
First as she raises him, then from beyond the grave.
Danny, as his parents did before him, is making a mess of his life,
and he's a small-time drug dealer with some big problems.</p>
<p>I grew up in Dublin, about a decade behind Danny Boyle,
so I enjoyed Murphy's evocation of Dublin in the 1970s.

    <p>Reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.alternet.org/economy/why-eyewear-industry-incredible-rip">Why the Eyewear Industry Is An Incredible Rip-Off</a>
reminds me that I need to get some new glasses.
I had my eyes tested last month and there is a small change in the pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion.
I've had my current glasses for about six years.</p>
<p>From ages 12 to 44, I needed only distance lenses for my myopia,
but then in the space of just a few months,
I developed the classic problem of middle age:
it became hard for me to read.
I got a pair of glasses with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.allaboutvision.com/lenses/progressives.htm">pro&shy;gres&shy;sive</a> lenses.

which covers inequality in the United States.
After several years of covering white-collar crime in Wall Street
after the financial collapse of 2008,
and not seeing <em>any</em> pros&shy;e&shy;cu&shy;tions,

<p>Marsh Tanner is a San Francisco private in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tor.
His secretary Peggy is starting to unravel,
as she's been getting sexually harassing phone calls for months,
which she's hidden from Marsh.
Thing is, she's also started to develop a case of
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome">Stockholm syndrome</a>
with her stalker.
Marsh discovers more about Peggy—and him&shy;self—than he really wants to.</p>
<p>Moderately enjoyable.
I found the plot and the characters plausible,
unlike so many modern stories.</p>
