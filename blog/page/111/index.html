<p>In mid-July, most of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.WorkForAtlas.com">Atlas Solutions</a>
developer teams moved from
our old offices at Fifth and Jackson in the In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al District
four blocks west to swanky offices in Pioneer Square.
The new offices are at the State building on the corner of
Occidental and Main, the pedes&shy;tri&shy;an&shy;ized block
with the antique stores and art galleries.
Occidental Park across the street has been re&shy;fur&shy;bished.
There are three coffee shops within two blocks,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/">Elliott Bay Books</a>
is one block west of us.
It&#8217;s all very pleasant, with the exception of the large
number of homeless&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>The only thing that I miss from the old offices is that we&#8217;re

<p>I spent far too much time on Friday trying to make <a class="reference external" href="https://logging.apache.org/log4net/">log4net</a> work in a <span class="caps">COM</span>+&nbsp;ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion.</p>
<p>Someone else had done part of the work necessary,
by creating an <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/florinlazar/archive/2003/12/04/41369.aspx">ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion.config</a> for the <span class="caps">COM</span>+ ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion
and setting a custom Ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion Root Directory.
This was enough to ensure that most of the managed code in the ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion
got their con&shy;fig&shy;u&shy;ra&shy;tion settings;
log4net being the&nbsp;exception.</p>
<p>It took some additional work to realize that we needed to add two assembly&nbsp;attributes:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[assembly: log4net.Config.Repository(&quot;unique-name&quot;)]
[assembly: log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator(ConfigFile=&quot;application.config&quot;)]
</pre>
<p>The repository name just needs to be a unique string.
We used the name of the&nbsp;assembly.</p>

I learned about Microsoft&#8217;s new blog posting client, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WindowsLiveWriterAndDasBlog19.aspx">Windows Live Writer</a>.
I&#8217;ve played around with it and it&#8217;s definitely the nicest free blogging client that I&#8217;ve&nbsp;used.</p>
<p>Here are in&shy;struc&shy;tions on con&shy;fig&shy;ur&shy;ing it to post to dasBlog.
I&#8217;m showing how to set it up for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.emmabart.com/Meanderings/">Emma&#8217;s blog</a>, since she&#8217;s running dasBlog 1.8.
I&#8217;m running a recent build of the as-yet unreleased dasBlog 1.9,
which supports Really Simple Discovery,
which makes the first part of this exercise simpler,
as <span class="caps">WLW</span> can infer that it&#8217;s dealing with Metaweblog <span class="caps">API</span>,
just by pointing it at the root of the&nbsp;blog.</p>

<p>This year is the 20th an&shy;niver&shy;sary of the Northwest <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Walk.
A whole generation has passed.
Twenty years ago, <span class="caps">AIDS</span> was considered a gay man&#8217;s disease and a death sentence.
The <span class="caps">U.S.</span> government was just beginning to ac&shy;knowl&shy;edge the existence of <span class="caps">AIDS</span>,
half a decade after it had first been recognized by health au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ties,
and thousands had&nbsp;died.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AIDS</span> is still a serious problem,
but the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of an&shy;ti&shy;retro&shy;vi&shy;ral drugs a decade ago
means that people with <span class="caps">HIV</span> are living longer,
healthier lives than before.
More than 1 million Americans are now living with <span class="caps">HIV</span>/<span class="caps">AIDS</span>:
9,000 of them in King County.

    <p>My brother David sent me this photo earlier today, of
me, him, and Michelle. I&#8217;m guessing that Michelle is less than a year old,
so it was taken sometime in 1971, which would make David four and me six.
(Our youngest brother, Mark, wasn&#8217;t born until&nbsp;1973.)</p>

<p>Emma thinks we&#8217;re adorable and has already made this picture her desktop
background on her work&nbsp;computer.</p>
<p>Mark has another photo of the four of us, taken in 1978

<p>Joe Lieberman, the 2000 vice-pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial nominee, lost the Democratic primary
for his Senate seat tonight. He has said that he will run as an in&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dent.
In effect, he will not accept the will of the&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Lieberman lost, in part, because of his continuing refusal to admit that
the Iraq war is a disaster, and in part because he has been a leading
enabler of the Republican agenda. Good&nbsp;riddance!</p>
