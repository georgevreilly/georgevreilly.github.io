<p>As promised <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/05/14/CirceRehearsal.aspx">yesterday</a>, I'm posting the poster for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2009.html">Circe reading</a>.
It's a fine painting by Ellen Coyle.
The shrunken image here doesn't do it justice.
You can download an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Circe1-Poster/Circe1-Poster.pdf">11&quot;x14&quot; PDF</a> (6MB) to see it in its full glory.</p>

<p>We're rehearsing most Wednesdays for our reading of the
first half of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/04/30/Bloomsday2009PressRelease.aspx">Circe chapter of Ulysses</a> next month.
It's going well.
We need some more rehearsal, but it now sounds like we know what we're doing.
Tonight we read the entire piece through from beginning to end,
for the first time.
Now we know that it takes two-and-a-quarter hours.</p>
<p>We also got the poster tonight.
It looks great!
I'd post it, but I need to get the painting scanned first.</p>

<p>I serve as tech support to my parents, Frank and Lyndol,
and a handful of others.
I was at Lyn's tonight to find out why he no longer had an Internet connection.
I told him when I arrived,
&quot;This will take a minute or an hour.&quot;
Either it was going to be something that I'd spot in a moment
or I'd be fighting with it for a while.</p>
<p>I im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly noticed that the network hub was un&shy;plugged—and dared to hope that it might be just that simple.
It wasn't, of course:
the hub had been unplugged during Lyn's own fruitless trou&shy;bleshoot&shy;ing.
I quickly pinpointed that the DSL modem was not <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/05/13/AMinuteOrAnHour.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>The U.S. Government have become really pissed off with the world-walking Clan,

It misses the clan but takes care of the new king who was waging war on them.
Miriam is pregnant with a royal child and manages to parlay that
into being crowned queen-widow.
The con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tive faction in the Clan view the nuke as a deadly insult

They are being drawn together at their remote Scottish estate, Garbadale,

His cousin Sophie will be there, the one he's loved from afar for twenty years,
since their affair was forcibly broken up.</p>

<p>We came up to Vancouver, BC for the weekend.
This morning, we visited the <a class="reference external" href="http://vancouver.ca/parks/parks/vandusen/website/">Van Dusen Botanical Garden</a> for the first time.
In a relatively small area, they've put together many spe&shy;cial&shy;ized gardens:
rhodo&shy;den&shy;drons, a maze, heathers, redwoods, roses, gingkos, and more.
In Seattle terms, it has elements of the <a class="reference external" href="http://depts.washington.edu/wpa/index.htm">Arboretum</a> and the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.rhodygarden.org/">Rhodo&shy;den&shy;dron Garden</a>.
Well worth a visit, especially on a beautiful May morning.</p>
<p>This afternoon, we drove down to Ladner to visit
my great-uncle Dick and his wife Margaret.
They moved into a retirement home in March.
Dick has visibly failed since we last saw him in September.
Margaret remains remarkably spry and fit, but is nearly blind.</p>

<p>Wyatt is a me&shy;te&shy;o&shy;rol&shy;o&shy;gist working with the U.S. Navy
on the small Caribbean island of San Fernandez.
He's convinced that Hurricane Mabel will change course and hit San Fernandez.
Trouble is, he can't convince the local dictator, Serrurier,
to evacuate the low-lying capital because the rebels have risen.</p>
<p>This is a fine early modern thriller by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/12/16/ReviewTheViveroLetter.aspx">Bagley</a>.
Aside from the im&shy;prob&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty of an in&shy;sur&shy;rec&shy;tion
<em>and</em> a major hurricane happening si&shy;mul&shy;ta&shy;ne&shy;ous&shy;ly,
it's quite believable.
The tension mounts as the weather worsens,
people act in character, and no one has improbable talents.
Wyatt is naive and idealistic and

<p>A month ago, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/04/08/VermontGayMarriageLegalized.aspx">Vermont and Iowa</a> passed gay marriage laws.
Today, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30602151/">Maine and New Hampshire</a> did the same.
The Maine Governor has already signed it into law.
The NH leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;ture passed a law, but it's possible their governor will veto it.</p>
<p>It's as if there were a pro-gay marriage backlash
after the anti-gay marriage <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/11/16/AgainstGayMarriageDontHaveOne.aspx">Propo&shy;si&shy;tion 8</a> passed in California last year.
Courts and leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;tures are realizing the fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal unfairness
of denying the benefits of marriage to all committed couples.
The sky didn't fall when Mass&shy;a&shy;chu&shy;setts legalized gay marriage five years ago.</p>
<p>There's no immediate prospect of a gay marriage law being enacted in Washington State.

<p>I ported <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/vim-win3264">Vim to Win64</a> but I don't have a convenient Win64 system
to test it on.</p>
<p>I decided to install the Win64 build of the Windows 7 RC on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>,
which has supported 64-bit guest operating systems since version 2.0.</p>
<p>It worked without problems on my MacBook Pro.
I used Vir&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;Box's Virtual Media Manager to mount the Windows 7 ISO
and installed from that.
See also the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-install-windows-7-on-virtualbox/">handy guide</a>.
(Why does Windows 7 offer a choice of upgrading from a previous
version of Windows on a virgin disk?)
After completing the in&shy;stal&shy;la&shy;tion of the operating system,
I installed the Guest Additions for mouse pointer in&shy;te&shy;gra&shy;tion
