<p>Joe Lieberman, the 2000 vice-pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial nominee, lost the Democratic primary
for his Senate seat tonight. He has said that he will run as an in&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dent.
In effect, he will not accept the will of the&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Lieberman lost, in part, because of his continuing refusal to admit that
the Iraq war is a disaster, and in part because he has been a leading
enabler of the Republican agenda. Good&nbsp;riddance!</p>

<p>Dr. Raven and Mr. Raven came over this evening for Games Night,
a twice-monthly get-together we have for our friends to play board games.
Emma and I had been given a bottle of <em>Dom Perignon &#8216;92</em> for our wedding
that we had never quite found a suitable occasion for until now,
so we chilled that in an&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pa&shy;tion of tonight&#8217;s cel&shy;e&shy;bra&shy;tion.

<p>Well, fuck! The Washington State Supreme Court handed down its long-awaited decision
today on the con&shy;sti&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ty of the state&#8217;s Defense of Marriage Act.
Somehow, they found that it didn&#8217;t violate the state con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&#8217;s Equal
Protection&nbsp;clause.</p>
<p>No same-sex marriages in Washington state anytime&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>I attended the <a class="reference external" href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/279042_samesex27.html">rally at the First Baptist church</a>
earlier this evening. (Find me in the photo!)
Some anger, some dis&shy;ap&shy;point&shy;ment. Mostly upbeat.
The young Latina couple were very affecting.
The Serkin-Pooles invited everyone to join their club,
as they announced their formal engagement to each other.
One speaker pointed out that even if the court had handed down a favorable
decision, the process would not have been&nbsp;over.</p>

Only their respective bosses, Su&shy;per&shy;in&shy;ten&shy;dant Wong and Big Sam, know who they are.
Each becomes aware of the other about the same time,

<p>I hadn&#8217;t really planned to visit Ireland this year, but then my sister

just proposed to her. Not a big surprise. They had moved in together
earlier this year, and we were all assuming that it was a question of when,
not&nbsp;if.</p>
<p>They plan to get married quite soon, as his father has been given
six-to-nine months to live, and they want him to be at the wedding. I don&#8217;t

<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2006.html">read the Cyclops chapter of Ulysses</a> on June 16th.
I read a part and I was also the script wrangler and&nbsp;webmaster.</p>
<p>My profile on my Windows <span class="caps">XP</span> laptop got corrupted. I decided that I would
make flatten it and turn it into a dual-boot system. I&#8217;m now on my third
week of running Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake). Quite easy to get going. Not so
easy to get everything that I wanted running on&nbsp;it.</p>
