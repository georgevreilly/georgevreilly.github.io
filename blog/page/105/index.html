Bill Gates and Will Poole showing FlexGo at WinHEC.

<a class="reference external" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/george_v_reilly/archive/2004/09/26/234349.aspx">as a contractor</a>.
A year later, I said that I was moving on, because my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/AtlasGeorge.html">12 months were up</a>.
In both cases, I said that I was doing some really in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing work and
that I hoped to be able to talk about it some day.</p>
<p>Now the truth can be told: I was working on

<p>I've been sporting a goatee for the last two months, instead of my usual
full beard. This has ne&shy;ces&shy;si&shy;tat&shy;ed shaving, and I've been using those
disposable Bic razors. I haven't been very happy with them. They left my
face feeling like I had been making out with a cheese grater.</p>
<p>I bought one of those new five-bladed <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gillettefusion.com/us/">Fusion razors</a> yesterday and shaved with it this
morning. Oh my! Very smooth!</p>
<p>I'm convinced that five blades is marketing hokum and that five blades is
probably not really better than four blades. Or three blades. But five
blades is certainly better than one.</p>
