<p>This year is the 20th an&shy;niver&shy;sary of the Northwest <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Walk.
A whole generation has passed.
Twenty years ago, <span class="caps">AIDS</span> was considered a gay man&#8217;s disease and a death sentence.
The <span class="caps">U.S.</span> government was just beginning to ac&shy;knowl&shy;edge the existence of <span class="caps">AIDS</span>,
half a decade after it had first been recognized by health au&shy;thor&shy;i&shy;ties,
and thousands had&nbsp;died.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AIDS</span> is still a serious problem,
but the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of an&shy;ti&shy;retro&shy;vi&shy;ral drugs a decade ago
means that people with <span class="caps">HIV</span> are living longer,
healthier lives than before.
More than 1 million Americans are now living with <span class="caps">HIV</span>/<span class="caps">AIDS</span>:
9,000 of them in King County.
40,000 people are infected every year in the U.S.,
and most new infections <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/08/18/SponsorMeForTheAIDSWalk.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>From Scott Hanselman,
I learned about Microsoft&#8217;s new blog posting client, <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/08/18/PostingToDasBlogWithWindowsLiveWriter.html/http%3a%2f%2fwww.hanselman.com%2fblog%2fWindowsLiveWriterAndDasBlog19.aspx">Windows Live Writer</a>.
I&#8217;ve played around with it and it&#8217;s definitely the nicest free blogging client that I&#8217;ve&nbsp;used.</p>
<p>Here are in&shy;struc&shy;tions on con&shy;fig&shy;ur&shy;ing it to post to dasBlog.
I&#8217;m showing how to set it up for <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/08/18/PostingToDasBlogWithWindowsLiveWriter.html/http%3a%2f%2fwww.emmabart.com%2fMeanderings%2f">Emma&#8217;s blog</a>, since she&#8217;s running dasBlog 1.8.
I&#8217;m running a recent build of the as-yet unreleased dasBlog 1.9,
which supports Really Simple Discovery,
which makes the first part of this exercise simpler,
as <span class="caps">WLW</span> can infer that it&#8217;s dealing with Metaweblog <span class="caps">API</span>,
just by pointing it at the root of the&nbsp;blog.</p>
<p>Launch <span class="caps">WLW</span> and Add a Weblog Account.
Choose Another weblog&nbsp;service.</p>

<p>Next, enter the <span class="caps">URL</span> <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/08/18/PostingToDasBlogWithWindowsLiveWriter.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>My brother David sent me this photo earlier today, of
me, him, and Michelle. I&#8217;m guessing that Michelle is less than a year old,
so it was taken sometime in 1971, which would make David four and me six.
(Our youngest brother, Mark, wasn&#8217;t born until&nbsp;1973.)</p>

<p>Emma thinks we&#8217;re adorable and has already made this picture her desktop
background on her work&nbsp;computer.</p>
<p>Mark has another photo of the four of us, taken in 1978
on his website, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.alienresident.net/">alien&shy;res&shy;i&shy;dent.net</a>:</p>

things future ages may dismiss with a snort — just as we look with
in&shy;creduli&shy;ty at our forebears’ faith in the theory of the four bodily
humours or possession by demons. Here is another modern candidate: the
idea that there is a set of males called ho&shy;mo&shy;sex&shy;u&shy;als, and another
called het&shy;ero&shy;sex&shy;u&shy;als, plus a handful in the middle called bisexuals <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2006/08/09/AreYouAnInBetween.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Joe Lieberman, the 2000 vice-pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial nominee, lost the Democratic primary
for his Senate seat tonight. He has said that he will run as an in&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dent.
In effect, he will not accept the will of the&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Lieberman lost, in part, because of his continuing refusal to admit that
the Iraq war is a disaster, and in part because he has been a leading
enabler of the Republican agenda. Good&nbsp;riddance!</p>

Emma and I had been given a bottle of <em>Dom Perignon &#8216;92</em> for our wedding
