I'll have more to say about Fly&shy;ing&shy;Cloud in future.

    <p>From Python, I needed to find a process that was performing SSH tunneling on port 8080
and kill it.</p>
<p>The following works in Bash:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
ps aux | grep [s]sh.*:8080 | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
</pre>

<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">grep [s]sh</tt> trick ensures that the <tt class="docutils literal">grep</tt> command itself
won't make it through to <tt class="docutils literal">awk</tt>.</p>
<p>Here's what I came up with in Python using <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonhosted.org/psutil/">psutil</a>:</p>

<pre class="brush: python">

<p>A disparate group of necro&shy;mancer hunters and artists are trekking through the desert.
They're out of food and the artists must compete not to be eaten by the strongmen
by telling stories by the campfire.
It's the Canterbury Tales crossed with Scheherazade.
The narrator shows how he skillfully and shame&shy;less&shy;ly ma&shy;nip&shy;u&shy;lat&shy;ed the various parties.
His stories within stories sow doubt and dissension.
There's black humor and art criticism and enough suspense to keep you going,
once you get past the in&shy;ter&shy;minable beginning.</p>

    <p>I needed to import some plugin code written in Python

Further, I needed a class object that was a subclass of the plugin base class.</p>

    <p>It's better to stay calm when things aren't going well.
Stress and panic are contagious.
When you're broad&shy;cast&shy;ing stress or panic on all channels,
other people start picking it up.
If you can keep your cool, others are more likely to remain calm too.
Often that's for the best,
but sometimes it backfires
because others in&shy;cor&shy;rect&shy;ly believe that everything is still okay.</p>
<p>Knowing when to ask for help is an art.
You learn a lot when you persevere and try different things,
many of which may fail.
The failures will likely show you where your un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing is deficient;
you learn some of the many ways in which things can go wrong.

Those contests were tonight,

The contest chair sets up everything be&shy;fore&shy;hand;
the toast&shy;mas&shy;ter runs the contest itself;
frequently but not nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;i&shy;ly the contest chair is also the toast&shy;mas&shy;ter.</p>
<p>I'm happy with how it came off.
I managed to recruit two speakers for the Speech contest
and three evaluators for the Evaluation contest,
all of whom acquitted themselves well.
I also recruited three judges, two ballot counters, one timer,
a sergeant at arms, and a test speaker

<p>I came across this cartoon today;
it reminded me that I've been meaning to write
about the hit-or-miss nature of adapting books for the screen.</p>
<p>Books and video/film are different media,
with different con&shy;ven&shy;tions and needs.
Often the most-loved elements of a book are lost
when it's adapted for television or film,
upsetting fans.</p>
<p>As J.K. Rowling wrote about one of the Harry Potter movies:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;It is simply impossible to in&shy;cor&shy;po&shy;rate every one of my storylines
into a film that has to be kept under four hours long.
Obviously films have re&shy;stric&shy;tions
– novels do not have con&shy;straints of time and budget;

<blockquote>
<p>From a cryp&shy;to&shy;graph&shy;ic standpoint, PGP is rock solid.
In practice, using it is very messy.
Its complexity has deterred the vast majority of people
who might otherwise benefit from using encryption.</p>
<p>The first problem is es&shy;tab&shy;lish&shy;ing a valid identity,
especially with other people located oceans away.
The second is dis&shy;trib&shy;ut&shy;ing public keys
without nefarious types posting al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tive keys
that appear to be registered to the same person.
...
The third issue is getting people to install and use PGP software.</p>
