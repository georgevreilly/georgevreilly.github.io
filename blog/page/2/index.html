<p>Three bomb disposal techs in Iraq are the subject of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hurt_Locker">The Hurt Locker</a>:
Sgt James (Jeremy Renner), Sgt Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Spec Eldridge (Brian Geraghty).
James has grown addicted to war and he is reckless and cavalier about disarming bombs,
while Sanborn is in&shy;creas&shy;ing&shy;ly angry at James' en&shy;dan&shy;ger&shy;ment of them all
and Eldridge grows ever more terrified and fatalistic.
<em>The Hurt Locker</em> is a gritty and visceral war film.
We have no idea what's going to happen next
and anyone could be blown up or shot at any time.

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters_(2016_film)">Ghost&shy;busters</a> remake is a light&shy;weight but enjoyable summer comedy and a lot of fun.
Four women, mostly dis&shy;cred&shy;it&shy;ed scientists, fight an increasing number of paranormal incursions
and kick some as&shy;s—with&shy;out wearing skintight clothing or being adjuncts to male leads.
Internet trolls may be outraged but the non-tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al casting works.
Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones are funny and jell together.
And Chris Hemsworth as the hunky but dim re&shy;cep&shy;tion&shy;ist is an amusing bit of reverse casting,
while Kate McKinnon seems to have become a <a class="reference external" href="http://the-orbit.net/teacosy/2016/07/21/jillian-holtzmann-is-queer-as-a-salty-parabola-and-not-here-for-the-straight-people/">queer icon</a> overnight.</p>

    <p>History was made tonight as Hillary Clinton became the first woman
nominated by a major party to run for President of the US.
It's a watershed moment for women's equality and it was long overdue.</p>
<p>I was a Bernie Sanders supporter in the earlier stages of the campaign,
as his message resonated more with me.
But I was always ready and willing to support Clinton.
I can't think of a nominee with a more impressive résumé who's run for President:
first lady of Arkansas for more than a decade,
First Lady of the US for two terms,
US Senator for New York state for eight years,
and Secretary of State <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/07/28/ImWithHer.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>1018AD. King Cnut of Denmark (aka <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnut_the_Great">Canute</a>) has recently conquered England,
and now must broker peace between the Saxons and the Danes at Oxford.
Also in Oxford are Winston, a talented il&shy;lu&shy;mi&shy;na&shy;tor of man&shy;u&shy;scripts,
and Halfdan, a roguish half-Danish half-Saxon landless noble.
A prominent Saxon has been murdered and Cnut commands Winston and Halfdan to in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gate.</p>
<p>While the mystery was reasonably while done,
I found the anachro&shy;nis&shy;tic speech patterns quite jarring.
The book is translated from Danish;
I presume this is also true in the original.</p>

Most of the crew are captured,

<p>We're in Los Angeles for the weekend to attend a wedding and it's scorch&shy;ing&shy;ly hot.
I took this photo of the car's dashboard while we were at a stop light in Topanga Canyon.
It reads 109°F (43°C).
I actually saw the tem&shy;per&shy;a&shy;ture briefly reach 111°F.
I've ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced the low hundreds before, but I don't think I've ever felt 109°F.</p>

<p>Abigail has gone missing from creepy Blackwater Farm days before her tenth birthday.
Her twin Olivia has been mute ever since.
Their strange mother is not helping matters and the father is acting oddly too.
DC Jennifer Knight, who belongs to a secret psychic police task force,
is the family liaison officer.
She must convince Olivia to break her silence and reveal what she knows
before time runs out for Abigail.</p>
<p>This was a reasonably good thriller that I think would have been better
without the su&shy;per&shy;nat&shy;ur&shy;al elements.</p>

<p>Millenia ago, the Dark Elves almost destroyed the Nine Realms
with their ultimate weapon known as the Aether.
Now the Con&shy;ver&shy;gence, when the Nine Realms briefly align, is imminent
and the surviving Dark Elves have returned to reclaim the Aether.
Meanwhile on Midgard (Earth),
as&shy;tro&shy;physi&shy;cist Jane Foster discovers portals linking the realms,
whereupon she in&shy;ad&shy;ver&shy;tent&shy;ly becomes the host of the Aether.
Thor rescues his lover and brings her to Asgard.
Many battles ensue across the Nine Realms
as Thor prevents the Elves from invoking the Aether at the Con&shy;ver&shy;gence.</p>
