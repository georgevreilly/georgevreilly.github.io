<a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2007/01/05/ChristmasCake.aspx">Christmas Cake</a> to put over
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2007/01/05/ChristmasCake.aspx">marzipan</a>.
A very tedious half hour with an electric handheld mixer
to beat the egg whites until they were stiff, and then beat in the powdered sugar.</p>
<p>The recipe that I used from an old Joy of Cooking called for the juice of 1 lemon.
I used ReaLemon which says that 3 ta&shy;ble&shy;spoons = 1 lemon.
I added two ta&shy;ble&shy;spoons, which was quite lemony.
The recipe that I've linked to calls for two teaspoons, which seems like a better choice.</p>
<p>I had drizzled whiskey over the cake several times to keep it moist.

<p>I made my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2007/01/05/ChristmasCake.aspx">Christmas Cake</a> back in November,
but am only now getting around to putting on the icing.
I've kept it moist with several ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions of whiskey.</p>
<p>Last year, I made <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzipan">marzipan</a> from scratch.
Never again!
It was a huge amount of work to blanch the almonds
and the stiff mixture of sugar and almonds caused the
food processor to seize up more than once.</p>
<p>I didn't use up all the marzipan that I made that time.
I put the remainder into a sealed container,
placed it in the fridge, and forgot all about it.
When I took it out of the fridge yesterday,
it was still good.
Oh, the top half-inch <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/01/22/Marzipan.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I seldom get bad colds, but I caught one on the plane back from Ireland,
and it's left me drained of energy for the last ten days.
Jet lag and Frank's death surely con&shy;tributed too.
Feh!</p>
<p>Maybe I'll be up to cycling into work tomorrow.
Between the snow, being in Ireland for two weeks, and this cold,
it's been almost a month since I last rode in.</p>

<p>Captain Alatriste has rejoined the Spanish army in Flanders,
besieging <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Breda">Breda</a> in 1625.
Íñigo, his follower and later biographer, is still too young to bear arms,
and serves as a forager for Ala&shy;tris&shy;te's squad.</p>
<p>There's no glory in this war—Pérez-Reverte is a former war cor&shy;re&shy;spon&shy;dent.
The Spanish empire is on the decline.
Spain has been fighting in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Netherlands">Spanish Nether&shy;lands</a> for sixty years
to suppress the Protestant heretics.
The Spanish troops are mutinous and close to starving;
they haven't been paid in a long time.

He had an active online life,

<p>We had a dry run for this in October, after he'd been in hospital for a month.
The need to deal with his eBay customers had grown pressing.
Lyndol is not tech&shy;ni&shy;cal&shy;ly savvy and was unable to handle it.
I had to work out how to get into his eBay, PayPal, and email accounts.
For&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, I was able to phone Frank in the hospital and ask him.

<p>Terry Pratchett was diagnosed with a rare form of early onset Alzheimer's in 2007.
For&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, it's not evident in this <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.lspace.org/">Discworld</a> book.</p>
<p>Moist von Lipwig, con man ex&shy;tra&shy;or&shy;di&shy;naire, finds himself in charge
of the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork and the Royal Mint.
The people don't trust the banks much.
In an effort to get money flowing, he introduces paper money to Ankh-Morpork.
Lipwig, like his creator, is an acute observer of people,
and pulls it off against the odds.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="http://www.funerals.coop/">People's Memorial Funeral Co&shy;op&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tive</a>
on Capitol Hill to make the arrange&shy;ment for Frank's cremation.</p>
<p>Years ago, I read Jessica Mitford's
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mitford.org/rev.htm">The American Way of Death Revisited</a>
and it left me with an even lower opinion
of the funeral industry than I already had.</p>
<p>I had never made any funeral arrange&shy;ments before.
It turned out to be both painless and in&shy;ex&shy;pen&shy;sive.
The funeral director sat down with us and gathered in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion
for the death cer&shy;tifi&shy;cate that the doctor was unable to provide,
such as parents' names and other personal details.
Initially, we put down “Software Doc&shy;u&shy;menter” as Frank's oc&shy;cu&shy;pa&shy;tion—his

<p>My nephew's name is Harold Mark Bowles, to be known as Harry.
I assume the Mark is after my brother.
No idea about the Harold/Harry.</p>
<p>I said <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/12/14/NewBabies.html">before</a> that my mother was very excited at becoming a grand&shy;moth&shy;er.
Here's the proof: take a look at the huge smile on her face.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, she was trying to decide what her new title was to be.
She was really pleased at becoming a granny,
but not at all eager to be known as “Granny”.
She tried out “Nan Et” (Et for Ethna), which we promptly turned into “Nanette”.
“Gran Et” was even worse: with a strong Dublin accent it <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/01/08/Harry.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I wrote <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/12/17/ToFrankAndLyndol.html">three weeks ago</a>, that Frank's time was limited.
He died yesterday at 3am of liver failure.
He had been un&shy;con&shy;scious since Saturday,
and he had been moved to a hospital bed in his living room on Thursday.</p>
<p>I was at a coffee shop near work yesterday morning
when Emma called me to relay the news from Lyndol.
We hurried over there and spent the rest of the day with him,
helping out as various friends came over.</p>
<p>Lyn is doing as well as can be expected.
He's sad, oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly weepy, and sometimes a little manic.
I think he's relieved that Frank's ordeal is over.
