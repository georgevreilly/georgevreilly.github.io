    <p>I'm in&shy;dif&shy;fer&shy;ent to most fantasy books, but I've been a fan of
George R.R. Martin's <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series,
since I read the first book,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553573403/georgvreill-20">A Game of Thrones</a>,
in 1997.
I read the second book
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553108034/georgvreill-20">A Clash of Kings</a>,
in 1999.
The third book
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055357342X/georgvreill-20">A Storm of Swords</a>
came out five years ago, and I've been awaiting
the fourth book,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553801503/georgvreill-20">A Feast for Crows</a>,
ever since.
After several post&shy;pone&shy;ments, it's finally out.</p>
<p>It's an epic tale of love, war, and intrigue.
Five Kings are fighting for control,
by sword, by guile, and sometimes by magic.
Strange creatures are rising in the frozen North, beyond the Wall.
Dragons are reap&shy;pear&shy;ing in the South.

    <p>Last Wednesday night, Emma emailed a dozen of our friends,
inviting them to join us for Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing dinner.
One reply arrived the next morning. Then nothing.</p>
<p>By Sunday evening, I had grown ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ed enough
to send out a snarky followup:</p>
<blockquote>
The courtesy of a belated reply would be ap&shy;pre&shy;ci&shy;at&shy;ed.
So far, we've got exactly one RSVP.</blockquote>
<p>It served its purpose. Replies cascaded in. Most, alas, said &quot;no&quot;;
they had other plans.</p>
<p>Would that this were an isolated incident.
Time and again, I've issued in&shy;vi&shy;ta&shy;tions that were not responded to.
A simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; is ideal.
A &quot;maybe&quot; is acceptable too,
especially if you follow up with a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no&quot;.</p>

    <p>I finally updated my blog to run on dasBlog 1.8.
Not too painful.
I unzipped the binary dis&shy;tri&shy;b&shy;u&shy;tion,
downloaded the content folder from my server to my local drive,
ran the provided upgrade utility,
and used WinMerge to update the con&shy;fig&shy;u&shy;ra&shy;tion files.</p>
<p>The most obvious change is that I'm using a new theme (skin),
which gives the site a very different look.
The previous default theme had problems if your browser window was too narrow,
due to some hardcoded table sizes (I think).</p>
<p>I also figured out how to post to dasBlog via w.bloggar.
I looked for info on con&shy;fig&shy;ur&shy;ing w.bloggar a few weeks ago, and couldn't find it then.</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has assisted George &amp; me in our attempt to
ready our home for hurricane evacuees.</p>
<p>Re&shy;gret&shy;tably, I have come to realize that I'm not emo&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly able to
make this commitment after all.  I thought I could open my home to
others, but I have sunk into a depression over the past few weeks that
has finally convinced me that I tried to bite off more than I <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/10/16/DecisionAboutEvacueeHousing.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p></blockquote>

    <p>The basement looks far better tonight than last night.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I removed all the lower panels along the entire front wall,
and filled in the cracks with concrete.
I also bought some in&shy;ex&shy;pen&shy;sive folding doors that will require some
framing.</p>
<p>Today, Chuck came over after the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.binetseattle.org/meeting.html#brunch">BiNet Brunch</a>
and helped me put back up the panels
and finish all the painting.
It looks intensely yellow.
The dark blue carpet will help tone it down.</p>
<p>After I've framed the doors,
the carpet can be layed.
I'm busy all next weekend,
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mountaineers.org/photography/workshop.html">Tim Grey's Photoshop Seminar</a>,
so I'll have to do it in the evenings.</p>
<p>I have not yet been able to order the window.

    <p>This afternoon I would have said that the basement was close to being finished.
The painting was almost done, the carpet was due to come in tomorrow,
and the window will arrive in two-to-three weeks.
But we've had a setback.</p>
<p>Since the last update, I have finished painting the spare bedroom.
Emma will move in there as soon as I finish writing this post.
She was waiting for the paint fumes to dissipate.</p>
<p>After Lowe's sent someone out to measure the new window hole,
I boarded it up with some plywood and 2x4s.</p>
<p>Dipankar came over Wednesday afternoon and helped me paint the
basement -- at least the parts that <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/30/ItNeverRainsButItPours.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>Work on the basement proceeds.</p>
<p>Our neighbor Leo helped me out with carpentry in the basement on Saturday.
Emma and Delf went to Oregon on Friday for the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flockandfiberfestival.com/">Flock and Fiber Festival</a>,
and didn't get back until Saturday night.
Leo and I stablized the framing around the furnace,
put up all the paneling,
routed the TV cables above the ceiling,
and replaced the missing ceiling tiles.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we planned to paint the spare bedroom and the basement.
It didn't work out as planned.
Just before lunch, Emma fell off a stepstool while
priming the walls of the spare bedroom, and hurt herself.
She spent six hours waiting in the Emergency Room
at Swedish <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/26/BasementTwoStepsForwardOneStepOff.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>Last weekend, we made good progress on the basement.
On Saturday, Dale and Ernest helped us out, doing some demolition
in the basement, and bringing loads to Goodwill and to the dump
in their truck.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Jill and Delf helped us clean the remaining stuff
out of the basement. Louise excavated a hole outside the window
that we're going to enlarge. Deb, currently <em>hors de combat</em>
with a pinched nerve, dropped by to provide moral support,
as did Frank and Lyndol. Delf spent nearly twelve hours with us that day,
and thanks to his experience in con&shy;struc&shy;tion, he and I built
framing around the furnace.</p>

<p>We've made some progress on getting our house ready to take in some

<p>On Labor Day, Emma and I thoroughly cleaned out the garage in the alley,
then put everything back much more ef&shy;fi&shy;cient&shy;ly,
so that we would have somewhere to store all of the stuff that was in our basement.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Emma made contact with Roy,
a doorman at her chi&shy;ro&shy;prac&shy;tor's and a native of New Orleans.
Roy and his other family members in the Seattle area
are looking to bring up about 20 of their extended family.
Roy was very keen to learn that we were offering space.
