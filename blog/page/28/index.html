<p>I bought a 2TB external hard disk today.
It's about the size of a deck of cards, but thinner,
and it cost me $95.
Disk Utility says it has 2,000,397,884,928 bytes.</p>
<p>In 1998, I got to see more than three terabytes of disks in one system.
At the time, a server with a 25GB disk was considered high capacity.
The 3TB system occupied con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;ably more volume than a pack of cards.
I don't know what it cost
but clearly it was tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>At that time, I was a developer on the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services">IIS</a> team at Microsoft.

<p>When I posted a link to the new <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/2015/01/leatherman-tread/">Leatherman Tread Bracelet</a> on Facebook
the other day, I mentioned that I had recently forfeited a little Swiss Army knife

The Tread is a bracelet where each link has one or more mini-tools.
The bracelet itself is about $150–$200, depending upon the exact tools.
With a watch, it's about $600.</p>
<p>While I can see the appeal, I have no intention of buying one.

we've enjoyed some un&shy;sea&shy;son&shy;ably warm weather in the Northwest.
Yesterday, it was 63°F (17°C) in Seattle—<a class="reference external" href="http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/seattle-sets-weather-record-boston-prepares-massiv/njw6m/">a record high tem&shy;per&shy;a&shy;ture</a>.

    <p>Washington state is well-known for coffee, wineries, and mi&shy;cro&shy;brew&shy;eries.
Dozens of small-batch craft dis&shy;til&shy;leries
have been started in Washington state since 2008
after a change in the law.
Most of them are quite good.
I drink Irish and Scotch whiskies,
but otherwise neither of us drink spirits often,
so we've barely tried the local dis&shy;til&shy;leries.</p>
<p>We drank a really nice gin from Sun Liquor at a New Year's Eve party,
and we've been meaning to follow up.
This afternoon, we stopped at the Oola Distillery on Capitol Hill
and sampled all their wares.
We left with a half bottle of their

    <p>When I buy a book, I want to be able to read it how and where I like,
not where the bookseller dictates.
With printed books, the very idea of the bookseller having any say is ridiculous.
The book is now my property, to read where and how I like,
to give away or to lend or even to sell.
I've bought thousands of new books and thousands more secondhand books from bookstores.</p>
<p>Most electronic books are crippled with DRM.
DRM stands for <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">Digital Rights Management</a>,
although <a class="reference external" href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/">Defective By Design</a> prefers to expand DRM

DRM is technology that controls digital content <em>after</em> it has been sold.

<p>As I mentioned <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2015/01/15/Audiobooks.html">last week</a>, we've been listening to some audiobooks.
We finished listening to <em>The Bee&shy;keep&shy;er's Apprentice</em> last night.
I read the book many years ago and I've read most of the subsequent books
in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Russell_%28character%29">Mary Russell</a> series.</p>
<p>Fifteen-year-old Mary Russell is walking on the Sussex Downs with her head in a book
one spring day in 1915, when she literally trips over Sherlock Holmes.
Although Holmes is almost four decades her senior,
the two brilliant, lonely people become friends
and Holmes tutors Russell in the art of detection.

to the audiobook of <em>The Hot Rock</em>, the first of the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dortmunder">Dortmunder</a> novels.
I just finished reading it as an ebook on my phone.
I enjoyed it a lot but I think I found it funnier when I heard it as an audiobook.
Partly, the first time around, I didn't know what was coming next;
partly, the narrator's skillful delivery gave me time to savor the humor.

    <p>I sat in a deserted coffee shop this afternoon with Emma,
as much of Seattle was watching the playoff game
of the Seattle Seahawks against the Green Bay Packers.
Idly curious, I checked the score early in the fourth quarter
and found that the Packers were leading 19–7.
I was quite surprised later to find that the Seahawks had won 28–22,
sending themselves to the Super Bowl in Arizona in two weeks' time.
Apparently, it was a thrilling comeback late in the game.</p>
<p>I suppose that I'm happy for my football-loving friends,
though I'm inclined to “love the sinner but hate the sin”,
as I can't stand football.
