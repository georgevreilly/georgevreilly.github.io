<p>I've been running the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/06/20/WhenVideoCardsGoBad.aspx">64-bit version of Windows 7 RC</a> since June.
It's been quite painless on the whole.</p>
<p>One wrinkle that I ran into was with some batchfiles which
launch ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions in <tt class="docutils literal">%Pro&shy;gram&shy;Files%</tt> (normally <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\Program&nbsp;Files</span></tt>).
Due to the magic <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/craigmcmurtry/archive/2004/12/14/301155.aspx">WOW64 redirector</a>, 32-bit ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions
are actually installed into <tt class="docutils literal">%Pro&shy;gram&shy;Files(x86)%</tt>—normally <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\Program&nbsp;Files&nbsp;(x86)</span></tt>—instead of <tt class="docutils literal">%Pro&shy;gram&shy;Files%</tt>.
This is trans&shy;par&shy;ent to the 32-bit ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions,
which think they're running in <tt class="docutils literal">%Pro&shy;gram&shy;Files%</tt> (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\Program&nbsp;Files</span></tt>).</p>
<p>However, the cmd.exe shell is 64-bit
(unless you make a special effort to run the 32-bit cmd.exe in SysWOW64),
so batchfiles see the 64-bit <tt class="docutils literal">%Pro&shy;gram&shy;Files%</tt> which contains 64-bit ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions.</p>
<p>Hence, a batchfile that launches an installed 32-bit ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion on Win64
must use <tt class="docutils literal">%Pro&shy;gram&shy;Files(x86)%</tt>, not <tt class="docutils literal">%Pro&shy;gram&shy;Files%</tt>.</p>
<p>It sounds <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/09/12/Launching32bitApplicationsFromBatchfilesOnWin64.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I spent 90&nbsp;minutes phonebank&shy;ing for <a class="reference external" href="http://approve71.org/">Approve 71</a> after work today.
I called voters who had already been identified as leaning pro&shy;gres&shy;sive

<p>Under the recent Domestic Part&shy;ner&shy;ship law
(SB&nbsp;5688 aka the “ev&shy;ery&shy;thing but marriage bill”),
registered domestic partners (same-sex couples
and opposite-sex couples with at least one partner over age 62),
and married couples, are now treated equally
under the law in all parts of Washington state.</p>
<p>The Religious Right objected and put together an initiative
which scraped together just enough signatures to be on the ballot.
They'll be voting to REJECT the bill,
which would overturn domestic part&shy;ner&shy;ships in this state.</p>

<p>Jack Irish is a one-time lawyer who makes a living doing odd job&shy;s—in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tions, racehorse hand&shy;i&shy;cap&shy;ping, cabinet making—in Melbourne.
A former client, who went to jail years ago while Jack had crawled into a bottle,
tries to reach Jack and promptly turns up dead.
Jack starts looking and what he finds isn't pretty:
corruption all the way up into the state government.</p>
<p>Jack isn't stupid, but he is naïve and out of his depth for much of the book.
Temple combines the Australian backdrop, social commentary,
a decent plot, and in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing characters to make <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/09/09/ReviewBadDebts.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Paying bills always makes me grumpy.
More than just the drain on my wallet,
it's also the sheer hassle and tedium.</p>
<p>I think it was last year that I finally switched over to using electronic billpay.
(I'm not always an early adopter.)
The hassle is less and I seldom write checks now.</p>
<p>I'd like to know why electronic payments take days, not mil&shy;lisec&shy;onds, to clear.
More predatory bank practices, no doubt.</p>
<p>I wrote several checks tonight.
For months I had been putting off renewing my membership
in various do-gooder or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tions like the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a>, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.glaad.org/">GLAAD</a>.

Actually, the weather was so wet this morning that we cooked and ate inside.</p>
<p>I am happy to report that thanks to the generosity of my sponsors,
I have raised $982 of my original goal of $1000.
With three weeks left until the walk,
I am predicting success in reaching my goal.</p>

<p>In Bram Stoker's 1897 <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula">novel</a>, Dracula relocates from Tran&shy;syl&shy;va&shy;nia to London.
Asking themselves, what would Dracula have done in London
before he was killed by Van Helsing,
18&nbsp;authors wrote un&shy;con&shy;nect&shy;ed short stories.
Dracula meets the Prince of Wales,
he is observed by the servants,
he terrorizes <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fort">Charles Fort</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Terry">Ellen Terry</a>,
he even takes the lead in the Pirates of Penzance.</p>

<p>On the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.firstthursdayseattle.com/">First Thursday</a> of every month,
there's an Art Walk around Seattle's Pioneer Square.
All the art galleries stay open late
and thousands of people wander around looking at the art.</p>
<p>It's a shame then that in the four years that I've worked in Pioneer Square,
I've only Art Walked a handful of times.
Maura and Joseph joined us on Thursday
and we spent a pleasant couple of hours talking and wandering around,
mostly through the Tashiro-Kaplan building.
Muhsin was supposed to come too, but couldn't find parking
as the Seahawks played a pre-season game.</p>
<p>There are other First Thursday events:
many of the museums are free after 5pm.

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://chuckanutdrive.com/">Chuckanut Drive</a> is one of Washington State's best yet least-known scenic drives.
Take I-5 north from Seattle for 70 miles.
Just past Burlington, exit on to state route&nbsp;11.
The highway heads northwest towards the coast
across the fertile floodplain of the Skagit valley.
For nine miles, you drive past farms and fields.
Then the road rises at the coast, changing character instantly.</p>
<p>Now you're driving along the rocky, forested shoulder of the Chuckanut mountains.
One hundred feet below as you drive along the twisty, shady road,
you can catch glimpses of the waters of Samish Bay through the trees.
If you look closely, you may see the train tracks,

<p>This afternoon, I invited 200 friends, family, and ac&shy;quain&shy;tances
to the <a class="reference external" href="http://family.cozi.com/reibart/">Reilly &amp; Bartholomew Family Journal</a>.
The Journal is the feature that we've been working on at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cozi.com/">Cozi</a> for several months.
It's a light&shy;weight blog that's really easy to set up and post to,
with straight&shy;for&shy;ward privacy controls.</p>
<p>More im&shy;por&shy;tant&shy;ly, though, I invited those people to use Cozi for themselves.</p>

<p>I'm inviting you to read the Family Journal that Emma and I set up at Cozi.
It's a way of letting our friends and relatives keep up with us.
If you see a story you like, add a smile.
We hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p>An old-school police procedural (by a real cop)

The prose is a little clumsy, but the story pulled me along.</p>
