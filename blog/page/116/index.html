    <p>I finally updated my blog to run on dasBlog 1.8.
Not too painful.
I unzipped the binary dis&shy;tri&shy;b&shy;u&shy;tion,
downloaded the content folder from my server to my local drive,
ran the provided upgrade utility,
and used WinMerge to update the con&shy;fig&shy;u&shy;ra&shy;tion&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>The most obvious change is that I&#8217;m using a new theme (skin),
which gives the site a very different look.
The previous default theme had problems if your browser window was too narrow,
due to some hardcoded table sizes (I&nbsp;think).</p>
<p>I also figured out how to post to dasBlog via w.bloggar.
I looked for info on con&shy;fig&shy;ur&shy;ing w.bloggar a few weeks ago, and couldn&#8217;t find it&nbsp;then.</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;all,</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has assisted George <span class="amp">&amp;</span> me in our attempt to
ready our home for hurricane&nbsp;evacuees.</p>
<p>Re&shy;gret&shy;tably, I have come to realize that I&#8217;m not emo&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly able to
make this commitment after all.  I thought I could open my home to
others, but I have sunk into a depression over the past few weeks that
has finally convinced me that I tried to bite off more than I could&nbsp;chew.</p>

    <p>The basement looks far better tonight than last&nbsp;night.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I removed all the lower panels along the entire front wall,
and filled in the cracks with concrete.
I also bought some in&shy;ex&shy;pen&shy;sive folding doors that will require some&nbsp;framing.</p>
<p>Today, Chuck came over after the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.binetseattle.org/meeting.html#brunch">BiNet Brunch</a>
and helped me put back up the panels
and finish all the painting.
It looks intensely yellow.
The dark blue carpet will help tone it&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>After I&#8217;ve framed the doors,
the carpet can be layed.
I&#8217;m busy all next weekend,
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mountaineers.org/photography/workshop.html">Tim Grey&#8217;s Photoshop Seminar</a>,
so I&#8217;ll have to do it in the&nbsp;evenings.</p>
<p>I have not yet been able to order the window.

    <p>This afternoon I would have said that the basement was close to being finished.
The painting was almost done, the carpet was due to come in tomorrow,
and the window will arrive in two-to-three weeks.
But we&#8217;ve had a&nbsp;setback.</p>
<p>Since the last update, I have finished painting the spare bedroom.
Emma will move in there as soon as I finish writing this post.
She was waiting for the paint fumes to&nbsp;dissipate.</p>
<p>After Lowe&#8217;s sent someone out to measure the new window hole,
I boarded it up with some plywood and&nbsp;2x4s.</p>
<p>Dipankar came over Wednesday afternoon and helped me paint the
basement &#8211; at least the parts that we could do <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/30/ItNeverRainsButItPours.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>Work on the basement&nbsp;proceeds.</p>
<p>Our neighbor Leo helped me out with carpentry in the basement on Saturday.
Emma and Delf went to Oregon on Friday for the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flockandfiberfestival.com/">Flock and Fiber Festival</a>,
and didn&#8217;t get back until Saturday night.
Leo and I stablized the framing around the furnace,
put up all the paneling,
routed the <span class="caps">TV</span> cables above the ceiling,
and replaced the missing ceiling&nbsp;tiles.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we planned to paint the spare bedroom and the basement.
It didn&#8217;t work out as planned.
Just before lunch, Emma fell off a stepstool while
priming the walls of the spare bedroom, and hurt herself.
She spent six hours waiting in the Emergency Room
at Swedish Hospital. She <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/26/BasementTwoStepsForwardOneStepOff.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>Two weeks ago, I completed a year as a contractor at Microsoft.
After the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permatemp">permatemps lawsuits</a>,
no contractor may work more than 12 months at Microsoft without taking a 100-day break.
(Con&shy;trac&shy;tors are free to work elsewhere, of course, during the&nbsp;break.)</p>
<p>Emma quit her job at washington Mutual the same week
in order to set up <a class="reference external" href="http://www.TheWheel.biz">her own business</a>.
It will be months before she starts making money,
so it seemed prudent for me to find a full-time&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>Last week, I in&shy;ter&shy;viewed with Amazon.
This week, I in&shy;ter&shy;viewed with
the group at Microsoft that I just left, Atlas <span class="caps">DMT</span>, and&nbsp;Google.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Atlas both made very attractive offers.

    <p>Last weekend, we made good progress on the basement.
On Saturday, Dale and Ernest helped us out, doing some demolition
in the basement, and bringing loads to Goodwill and to the dump
in their&nbsp;truck.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Jill and Delf helped us clean the remaining stuff
out of the basement. Louise excavated a hole outside the window
that we&#8217;re going to enlarge. Deb, currently <em>hors de combat</em>
with a pinched nerve, dropped by to provide moral support,
as did Frank and Lyndol. Delf spent nearly twelve hours with us that day,
and thanks to his experience in con&shy;struc&shy;tion, he and I built
framing around the&nbsp;furnace.</p>

    <p>I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2005/08/26/AIDSWalk2005.html">mentioned recently</a> that I would be walking in this year&#8217;s <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Walk.
And so I&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>After months of dry, sunny weather in Seattle, I have grown un&shy;ac&shy;cus&shy;tomed to rain.
It was an unpleasant morning and an unpleasant shock.
The skies opened and I stood in an endless line waiting to register.
I raised $1180, which entitled me to huddle in the <span class="caps">VIP</span> tent, as the rain continued.
The rain finally let up about halfway along the route, as we debouched onto&nbsp;Broadway.</p>
<p>Thanks to my fellow Team BiNet Seattle fundrais&shy;ers, Emily and Meghan,
who raised a few hundred more between them.
Double thanks to Emily for giving me a <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/14/AIDSWalkRainHappens.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>On Labor Day, Emma and I thoroughly cleaned out the garage in the alley,

    <p>I learned a really clever trick at our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2005/09/14/KatrinaEvacueesWorkPartiesAndScalingBack.html">workparty</a> on&nbsp;Sunday.</p>
<p>We were using a dolly that we had borrowed from our neighbor Mary
to haul a heavy credenza up from the basement.
One of the tires was flat, which made the exercise even more&nbsp;difficult.</p>
<p>I got out my bicycle floor pump and started pumping,
but it was a waste of time.
The tire was tubeless and without any air,
so it just slipped loosely around the rim.
After a few minutes of futility,
Dale remembered something he had seen years before at a gas&nbsp;station.</p>
<p>He got a bowl of soapy water and a sponge,
and coated the metal rim and both <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2005/09/14/SoapingUpAFlatTire.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>
