<p>Charlie Parker, the hero of John Connolly's books,
has always been able to rely on his friends,
the former assassin Louis and his life-partner Angel,

<p>Louis' past is catching up with him, leading to a bloody climax.
As we explore that past,
we learn how a gay, black teenager in a <a class="reference external" href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2008/01/how-to-out-sundown-town.html">sundown town</a>

One new person was elected to the board,

I am the outgoing Secretary and the incoming Treasurer,

<p>I rode on a Segway today, for the first time.
It was a lot of fun: a two-hour of Portland's waterfront
with nine other motsscon people.
I could have done without the 80°F heat though.</p>
<p>It took a few minutes for me to find my balance and to feel com&shy;fort&shy;able.
After that, it came pretty naturally.</p>

<p>Today, I did something that I've never done before.
I visited my US Senators' offices, with a handful of others,
to help stiffen their spines on healthcare reform.</p>
<p>It started by accident last night when Mira mentioned on Facebook
that she was going to visit Rep. Jim McDermott, Sen. Maria Cantwell,
and Sen. Patty Murray's Seattle offices today
to talk to them about the “public option”.</p>
<p>McDermott and Murray were already supporters of the public health insurance option.
Cantwell's position was murkier and she came out in favor of
some kind of lame “co-op” compromise earlier this week.
Mira and her friends had no difficulty in setting up meetings with <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2009/06/27/TalkingToSenatorsAboutHealthcareReform.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I'm heading down to Portland tomorrow evening for <a class="reference external" href="http://motsscon.hostica.com/">Motsscon XXII</a>,

<p>It seems no-one thought to set up a map of the events and restau&shy;rants,
so I spent half an hour in Google Maps creating a <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=110520498248815013952.00046ca7b3b1e41b1a012">custom map</a>.
It was sur&shy;pris&shy;ing&shy;ly painless and the sug&shy;ges&shy;tions for businesses near an address
really helped.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: 10 minutes after writing the above,
Google Maps crashed Safari&nbsp;4 while trying to print the map.</p>
