<p>A few decades hence, Britain has devolved into balkanized ministates.
A Trotskyite, space-loving mercenary in&shy;ad&shy;ver&shy;tent&shy;ly awakens an AI
and sparks the revolution.
The plot is un&shy;sum&shy;ma&shy;riz&shy;able, but it's en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing and complex,
mixing action, political theory, cyberpunk, and romance.</p>

<p>I spent much of today playing around with
the brand-new Jaunty/9.04 release of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.canonical.com/projects/ubuntu/unr">Ubuntu Netbook Remix</a>
on my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/11/26/Eee.aspx">Eee 1000H netbook</a>.
Previously I had run the Hardy/8.04 version of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ubuntu-eee.com/">Ubuntu Eee</a> on this system.
I had never bothered to update to Intrepid/8.10,
but now that UNR is fully supported by Canonical,
I thought it was time to try it out.</p>
<p>I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download-netbook">downloaded</a> the UNR image last night onto my Mac,
and trans&shy;ferred the image to a 1GB USB stick this morning.
(The <a class="reference external" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles/#Mac%20OS%20X">Mac in&shy;struc&shy;tions</a> required a little tweaking.)</p>
<p>I spent some time running the Live Image first, before clean installing.
Everything worked seamlessly except the <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/354620">microphone</a>.

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://scrum.dk/about_scrum">Scrum</a> and Agile revolve around sprints.
At my previous employer, I spent two years working in one-week sprints.
At my current job, I've spent another two years working in four-week sprints.</p>
<p>Each has their own rhythm.
We ran the one-week sprint from Wednesday to the following Tuesday.
Wednesday morning, we'd demo the previous week's work and we'd plan,
drawing up a series of task cards, measured in hours.
With a one-week horizon, you couldn't go very far off track.
You can't get a huge amount done in a week either.
You need to have a bigger picture in mind
that transcends several weeks.
We released every couple of months.</p>

    <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#format-string-syntax"></a>
<p>Python has long had a string in&shy;ter&shy;po&shy;la&shy;tion operator, <tt class="docutils literal">%</tt>.</p>
<p>Python 2.6 and 3.0 introduced a new, richer set of <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#format-string-syntax">string formatting operations</a>.
See <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/">PEP 3101</a> for the rationale.</p>
<p>One trick that I liked with the old way of formatting was
to put the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#locals">locals()</a> dictionary or <tt class="docutils literal">self.__dict__</tt>
on the right-hand side</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">stuff</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="o">...</span>  <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">b</span>
<span class="o">...</span>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="si">%(a)s</span><span class="s">, </span><span class="si">%(b)s</span><span class="s">, </span><span class="si">%(c)s</span><span class="s">, </span><span class="si">%(d)s</span><span class="s">&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="nb">locals</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="s">&#39;3, 17, 20, -14&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It took me a few minutes to figure out how to do the equivalent with <tt class="docutils literal">string.format</tt>:
use the <tt class="docutils literal">**</tt> syntax to unpack the dict into <tt class="docutils literal">kwargs</tt>.</p>

<p>I took today off and headed north to the Skagit Valley with Emma and Lyndol
to see the tulips.
It was a glorious spring day,
sunny, not too warm, a light breeze.
The tulip fields were busy for a weekday;
they're completely overrun at the weekends.</p>
<p>We wandered around <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tuliptown.com/">Tulip Town</a> for an hour,
had lunch in La Conner,
and headed back to Seattle via Camano Island.</p>
<p>We had intended to take <a class="reference external" href="http://www.byways.org/explore/byways/2579/stories/67281">Chuckanut Drive</a> up to Fairhaven,
but Emma wasn't feeling well.
Some other time.
Chuckanut Drive is pretty year round;
the tulips are good only for another couple of weeks.</p>

<p>I gave a poetry reading tonight, of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/01/07/FrankRAJMaloney19452009.aspx">Frank Maloney</a>'s poems.
I'm working through a book of In&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;tive Reading projects
at Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters.
I had to read some poetry for tonight's project
and Frank's work was an obvious choice.
(Had I remembered, I would have recorded the reading and made a podcast.)</p>
<p>Frank was most active as a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Richard_Maloney_(poet)">poet</a> in the 1970s when he published
his collection, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Eat-Slug-Frank-Maloney/dp/0914742140/">How to Eat a Slug</a>.</p>
<p>Six poems follow that give a taste of his work.
The material in [square brackets] I omitted from the reading.</p>

<p>There are two Dr. Temperance Brennan's.
Both are forensic an&shy;thro&shy;pol&shy;o&shy;gists.
One is the heroine of Kathy Reichs' novels,
who, like Reichs herself, is a professor in North Carolina
and works with the Montreal police.
The other is the star of the TV show, <em>Bones</em>,
is brilliant but devoid of social skills,
works with the FBI in Washington DC,
and has a state-of-the-art lab and a crack team of geeks.</p>

<p>I fear going into my home office.
It's a huge mess of clutter,
books piled everywhere, boxes of unsorted papers,
crap all over my desk.
(No, it's not as bad as the ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;ny&shy;ing photo.)</p>
<p>My office overwhelms me.
As a result, I don't go in there,
except to drop more stuff off and make it worse.
I rarely use the desktop system there.</p>
<p>The living room couch has become my sub-office.
I sit there of an evening and surf the web from my laptop.
I pull out the bills every couple of weeks
and take care of them from the couch.
Then I dump them in the office.</p>
<p>I know what the solution is.

<p>One app that I really want for my iPhone is <a class="reference external" href="http://ikeepass.de/">iKeePass</a>,
an port of the <a class="reference external" href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> password safe.
I've mentioned it <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2006/02/06/200KeePassEntries.aspx">before</a>.
I'm up to about 400 entries now.
It's completely in&shy;dis&shy;pens&shy;able to me for keeping track
of not just passwords, but identities,
and which websites I've registered on.</p>
<p>Apple is holding up approval of iKeePass, apparently in&shy;def&shy;i&shy;nite&shy;ly.
It seems to be some com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion of not wanting
to approve strong encryption for export
and hangups about open source.
Or something.
Whatever it is, it's damned annoying.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a> works on Mac and Linux and means that I can move
my password database back and forth to Windows without problem.
