<p>For weeks, Lyn has been telling us about the musical talk that
he was going to give today at his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rvuuc.org/"><span class="caps">UU</span> con&shy;gre&shy;ga&shy;tion</a>
about <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Strayhorn">Billy Strayhorn</a>, a little-known but talented composer,
who col&shy;lab&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ed for decades with Duke Ellington.
Strayhorn was openly gay in the homophobic decades before Stonewall.
That, coupled with his apparent liking for remaining in Ellington&#8217;s shadow,
probably con&shy;tributed to his&nbsp;obscurity.</p>
<p>Lyn talked about Billy Strayhorn and his life and music for half an hour.
He also ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;nied Shirley singing some Strayhorn songs on piano,
as Linda and Marion played the clarinet and cello.
He said that Strayhorn&#8217;s life gives rise to two questions,

<p>I mentioned <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/06/20/WhenVideoCardsGoBad.html">three weeks ago</a> that I had just repaved my work dev box
and installed the 64-bit version of the Windows&nbsp;7&nbsp;<span class="caps">RC</span>.
Nine or ten years after I first ported parts of <span class="caps">IIS</span> to Win64,
I am finally running my main desktop on 64-bit Windows.
With one exception, it&#8217;s been painless.
Programs have just worked, devices have just worked.
There are relatively few native x64 ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions,
but for the most part it doesn&#8217;t matter.
The cases where it does matter—e.g., shell extensions such as <a class="reference external" href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">Tor&shy;tois&shy;eSVN</a>—are available as 64-bit&nbsp;binaries.</p>

<p>We held our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/07/08/HealthCareNowRallyOnThursday.html">rally</a> for healthcare and the public option at lunchtime,
outside the Jackson Federal Building
where both Senators Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray
have their Seattle&nbsp;offices.</p>
<p>Turnout was good: about 100 people, I&#8217;d say.
We had about half-a-dozen speakers over 45 minutes.
A cameraman from King–5 covered it, but I can&#8217;t find anything on their website.
A handful of people went upstairs to the senators&#8217; offices
and delivered 291&nbsp;pages of&nbsp;petitions.</p>
<p>One concrete suggestion that I came away with
is to write a <em>hand&shy;writ&shy;ten</em> letter to the senators
advocating for healthcare reform.
Hand&shy;writ&shy;ten letters carry more weight than printed letters or calls
and much more weight than&nbsp;emails.</p>
<p>Do it soon.

<p>We&#8217;re traveling to Spain and Ireland for three weeks.
I&#8217;m bringing the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/04/25/UbuntuNetbookRemix904.html">netbook</a>, not the 17&quot;&nbsp;MacBook Pro, because it&#8217;s small and light.
It doesn&#8217;t have a <span class="caps">DVD</span> player and I&#8217;d like to bring some DVDs to watch.
I could either spend about $80 on an external <span class="caps">DVD</span> player,
or I could rip the DVDs&nbsp;beforehand.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve ripped a few DVDs with <a class="reference external" href="http://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a>,
an open source, cross-platform video transcoder,
which seems to do a good job.
I&#8217;m playing them in the cross-platform <a class="reference external" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"><span class="caps">VLC</span></a> player,
which released version 1.0.0 yesterday, after almost 8&nbsp;years of&nbsp;de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, a group of us <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/06/27/TalkingToSenatorsAboutHealthcareReform.html">visited our senators&#8217; offices</a>
to talk to their staffers about the Public Option in health care.
We&#8217;re organizing a downtown Seattle rally at the Federal Building on Thursday at 12:15pm,

It&#8217;s one of the large number of rallies that <a class="reference external" href="http://pol.moveon.org/event/events/index.html?action_id=180">MoveOn.org is organizing</a>
at senators&#8217; offices all around the country on&nbsp;Thursday.</p>

<p>Lyn, Raven, and Iain came over on Friday night for dinner.
We did a little planning for Frank&#8217;s memorial today
and selected some&nbsp;poems.</p>
<p>Emma and I packed up the car and got to Lyn&#8217;s by noon,
which gave us plenty of time to set up.
I wore my com&shy;mem&shy;o&shy;ra&shy;tive <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/07/03/PortlandMotssconXXII.html">Portland motsscon</a> t-shirt,
which I know Frank would have gotten a kick out&nbsp;of.</p>
<p>A dozen or so of Frank&#8217;s friends arrived around 2&nbsp;o&#8217;clock.
We chatted for a while waiting for Holly and Kim to arrive
after fighting through the crowded ferry system from Vashon Island.

<p>Le Carré&#8217;s very first novel,
<em>Call for the Dead</em> introduces his most famous character, George Smiley.
After a harmonious meeting with Smiley to review his security clearance,
Samuel Fennan goes home, writes a letter com&shy;plain&shy;ing of har&shy;rass&shy;ment,
and commits suicide.
But little things don&#8217;t add up and Smiley starts in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gat&shy;ing,
only to be nearly murdered&nbsp;himself.</p>
<p>A strong debut, and amazingly short at 160&nbsp;pages.
<em>Call</em> provides some background about Smiley&#8217;s very bad war,
undercover in Nazi ter&shy;ri&shy;to&shy;ries, and his rocky&nbsp;marriage.</p>

<span class="caps">MOTSS</span> = members of the same sex, an opaque euphemism for gay attraction,
which helped the group be created with a minimum of fuss in&nbsp;1983.</p>
<p>I lurked on soc.motss for two years.
I knew that I was bisexual, but I wasn&#8217;t ready to admit it to anyone.
Then my friend Éamonn came out as gay and I promptly came out to him.

Johnny Depp gives a charis&shy;mat&shy;ic per&shy;for&shy;mance of a ruthless and audacious killer,
