    <p>At our Sixth Day of Christmas party yesterday, Delf started talking
about burns from hot peppers, which reminded me of a crazy thread
that I read a while back, <a class="reference external" href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/006812.html">Listening to habeneros</a>,
and of a sure-fire cure for hiccups from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.owlsprings.com/">Diane Duane</a>.</p>
<p>Me, when I get hiccups,
I just take a very deep breath and hold it for as long as I can.
If it doesn't work the first time, it does on the second attempt.</p>
<p>Cure #1, letting a large spoonful of sugar dissolve in the mouth,
is the only cure that's ever worked for Emma.</p>
<p>Here's Diane Duane on <a class="reference external" href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/006812.html#95991">curing hiccups</a>:</p>

My fingers re&shy;flex&shy;ive&shy;ly use vi keystrokes to move around,

<p>As the Twelve Days of Christmas approach,
it's time once again to make fun of them.
Strictly speaking, we can't start until
December 25th, the first day of Christmas,
but the Xmas season starts earlier every year.</p>
<p>My favorite has long been Frank Kelly's <em>Christmas Countdown</em>,
which was a big hit in Ireland and Britain in the early 1980s.
It's couched as twelve in&shy;creas&shy;ing&shy;ly ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ed letters from
Gobnait O'Lughnasa to his friend Nuala. Here's Day Six:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nuala,</p>

your generosity but the six geese have not alone nearly murdered the

    <p>I'm in&shy;dif&shy;fer&shy;ent to most fantasy books, but I've been a fan of
George R.R. Martin's <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series,
since I read the first book,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553573403/georgvreill-20">A Game of Thrones</a>,
in 1997.
I read the second book
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553108034/georgvreill-20">A Clash of Kings</a>,
in 1999.
The third book
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055357342X/georgvreill-20">A Storm of Swords</a>
came out five years ago, and I've been awaiting
the fourth book,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553801503/georgvreill-20">A Feast for Crows</a>,
ever since.
After several post&shy;pone&shy;ments, it's finally out.</p>
<p>It's an epic tale of love, war, and intrigue.
Five Kings are fighting for control,
by sword, by guile, and sometimes by magic.
Strange creatures are rising in the frozen North, beyond the Wall.
Dragons are reap&shy;pear&shy;ing in the South.

    <p>Last Wednesday night, Emma emailed a dozen of our friends,
inviting them to join us for Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing dinner.
One reply arrived the next morning. Then nothing.</p>
<p>By Sunday evening, I had grown ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;at&shy;ed enough
to send out a snarky followup:</p>
<blockquote>
The courtesy of a belated reply would be ap&shy;pre&shy;ci&shy;at&shy;ed.
So far, we've got exactly one RSVP.</blockquote>
<p>It served its purpose. Replies cascaded in. Most, alas, said &quot;no&quot;;
they had other plans.</p>
<p>Would that this were an isolated incident.
Time and again, I've issued in&shy;vi&shy;ta&shy;tions that were not responded to.
A simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; is ideal.
A &quot;maybe&quot; is acceptable too,
especially if you follow up with a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no&quot;.</p>

    <p>I finally updated my blog to run on dasBlog 1.8.
Not too painful.
I unzipped the binary dis&shy;tri&shy;b&shy;u&shy;tion,
downloaded the content folder from my server to my local drive,
ran the provided upgrade utility,
and used WinMerge to update the con&shy;fig&shy;u&shy;ra&shy;tion files.</p>
<p>The most obvious change is that I'm using a new theme (skin),
which gives the site a very different look.
The previous default theme had problems if your browser window was too narrow,
due to some hardcoded table sizes (I think).</p>
<p>I also figured out how to post to dasBlog via w.bloggar.
I looked for info on con&shy;fig&shy;ur&shy;ing w.bloggar a few weeks ago, and couldn't find it then.</p>
