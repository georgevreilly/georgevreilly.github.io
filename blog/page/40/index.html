<p>Many of the screen&shy;shots that show up on my blog were captured with <a class="reference external" href="http://xtralean.com/IWOverview.html">ImageWell</a>,
a little Mac app with resizing, uploading, and rudi&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;ry image editing func&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ty.
It used to be freeware.
Now it costs $20 after the trial period runs out.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://projects.digitalwaters.net/index.php?q=instantshot">In&shy;stantShot!</a> is a menu bar app that does a good job of taking screen&shy;shots,

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.chocoflop.com/">ChocoFlop</a>, which I've only just discovered,

The rest are pretty bad.

    <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#format-string-syntax"></a>
<p>Python has long had a string in&shy;ter&shy;po&shy;la&shy;tion operator, <tt class="docutils literal">%</tt>.</p>
<p>Python 2.6 and 3.0 introduced a new, richer set of <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#format-string-syntax">string formatting operations</a>.
See <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/">PEP 3101</a> for the rationale.</p>
<p>One trick that I liked with the old way of formatting was
to put the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#locals">locals()</a> dictionary or <tt class="docutils literal">self.__dict__</tt>
on the right-hand side</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">stuff</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="o">...</span>  <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">b</span>
<span class="o">...</span>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="si">%(a)s</span><span class="s">, </span><span class="si">%(b)s</span><span class="s">, </span><span class="si">%(c)s</span><span class="s">, </span><span class="si">%(d)s</span><span class="s">&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="nb">locals</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="s">&#39;3, 17, 20, -14&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It took me a few minutes to figure out how to do the equivalent with <tt class="docutils literal">string.format</tt>:
use the <tt class="docutils literal">**</tt> syntax to unpack the dict into <tt class="docutils literal">kwargs</tt>.</p>

<p>I took today off and headed north to the Skagit Valley with Emma and Lyndol
to see the tulips.
It was a glorious spring day,
sunny, not too warm, a light breeze.
The tulip fields were busy for a weekday;
they're completely overrun at the weekends.</p>
<p>We wandered around <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tuliptown.com/">Tulip Town</a> for an hour,
had lunch in La Conner,
and headed back to Seattle via Camano Island.</p>
<p>We had intended to take <a class="reference external" href="http://www.byways.org/explore/byways/2579/stories/67281">Chuckanut Drive</a> up to Fairhaven,
but Emma wasn't feeling well.
Some other time.
Chuckanut Drive is pretty year round;
the tulips are good only for another couple of weeks.</p>

<p>I gave a poetry reading tonight, of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/01/07/FrankRAJMaloney19452009.aspx">Frank Maloney</a>'s poems.
I'm working through a book of In&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;tive Reading projects
at Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters.
I had to read some poetry for tonight's project
and Frank's work was an obvious choice.
(Had I remembered, I would have recorded the reading and made a podcast.)</p>
<p>Frank was most active as a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Richard_Maloney_(poet)">poet</a> in the 1970s when he published
his collection, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Eat-Slug-Frank-Maloney/dp/0914742140/">How to Eat a Slug</a>.</p>
<p>Six poems follow that give a taste of his work.
The material in [square brackets] I omitted from the reading.</p>

<p>Frank was long interested in Chinese and Japanese art

<p>There are two Dr. Temperance Brennan's.
Both are forensic an&shy;thro&shy;pol&shy;o&shy;gists.
One is the heroine of Kathy Reichs' novels,
who, like Reichs herself, is a professor in North Carolina
and works with the Montreal police.
The other is the star of the TV show, <em>Bones</em>,
is brilliant but devoid of social skills,
works with the FBI in Washington DC,
and has a state-of-the-art lab and a crack team of geeks.</p>
<p>A war has erupted between biker gangs in Montreal.

<p>I fear going into my home office.
It's a huge mess of clutter,
books piled everywhere, boxes of unsorted papers,
crap all over my desk.
(No, it's not as bad as the ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;ny&shy;ing photo.)</p>
<p>My office overwhelms me.
As a result, I don't go in there,
except to drop more stuff off and make it worse.
I rarely use the desktop system there.</p>
<p>The living room couch has become my sub-office.
I sit there of an evening and surf the web from my laptop.
I pull out the bills every couple of weeks
and take care of them from the couch.
Then I dump them in the office.</p>
<p>I know what the solution is.

<p>One app that I really want for my iPhone is <a class="reference external" href="http://ikeepass.de/">iKeePass</a>,
an port of the <a class="reference external" href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> password safe.
I've mentioned it <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2006/02/06/200KeePassEntries.aspx">before</a>.
I'm up to about 400 entries now.
It's completely in&shy;dis&shy;pens&shy;able to me for keeping track
of not just passwords, but identities,
and which websites I've registered on.</p>
<p>Apple is holding up approval of iKeePass, apparently in&shy;def&shy;i&shy;nite&shy;ly.
It seems to be some com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion of not wanting
to approve strong encryption for export
and hangups about open source.
Or something.
Whatever it is, it's damned annoying.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a> works on Mac and Linux and means that I can move
my password database back and forth to Windows without problem.

<p>I spent part of my day fighting with CSS for an email template.
CSS support is poor in both desktop and web clients,
and much worse than in current browsers.</p>
<p>Gmail, for example, does not support <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;style&gt;</tt>
in either the head or the body of HTML email.
You have to explicitly set <tt class="docutils literal">style</tt> attributes on individual nodes.
You might as well be using <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;font&gt;</tt> tags!</p>
<p>You can't assume that images will be downloaded,
so the mail has to make sense without them.
And forget iframes.</p>

<p>Seven years ago, “Paul Hardy” was found with his head smashed in.
He recovered physically, but not mentally.
After another accident, his wits come back and a few memories.
Googling for the one name he remembers brings the NSA to his door.
He goes on the run, causing the un&shy;rav&shy;el&shy;ling of a coverup.</p>
<p>Efficient, well-plotted thriller in the paranoid vein.
The plot is as risible as most such books, but no matter.
Enjoy it for a few hours.</p>

<p>I like paying taxes. With them I buy civ&shy;i&shy;liza&shy;tion.</p>

<p>The accountant completed our return last night.
Usually we have something of a rebate,
so the amount that we owed came as an unwelcome surprise.
It's paid now.
Bah!</p>
<p>I pay taxes willing enough, but “like” is too strong.
We cannot run a complex society without taxes.
There are many functions that the vaunted free market performs poorly if at all:
roads, sewers, schools, police, health care, education, defense, emer&shy;gen&shy;cies.
The profit motive is at odds with providing good, dis&shy;pas&shy;sion&shy;ate service.
Government doesn't nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;i&shy;ly do it well either,
especially when it's run by people who are ide&shy;o&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly opposed to taxes.
