<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://komonews.com/news/local/downtown-seattle-hit-by-major-power-outage">power suddenly went out</a> at work today about 11:30am.
There was a technician who was running wires,
standing on a ladder next to us,
who disclaimed all re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty.
Since the wires were Ethernet cables, we believed him.
It quickly became apparent that it was not just our office or even our building,
but many blocks of downtown Seattle that had lost power.
One person was trapped in the elevator in our old Pioneer Square building.
Within half an hour, everyone had left the office.
Although most of us have laptops,
no elec&shy;tric&shy;i&shy;ty meant no Internet.
I drifted up to Capitol Hill and spent the afternoon

<p>I spent a couple of frus&shy;trat&shy;ing hours this evening
trying to figure out an easy way to deploy a Docker container on AWS.
I tried out the <a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">EC2 Container Service</a> and got lost
in a sea of Clusters, Tasks, and Services.
I couldn't connect to the EC2 instance where my container supposedly lived.</p>
<p>I tried <a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Elastic Beanstalk</a> and gave up in ex&shy;as&shy;per&shy;a&shy;tion.
When you create a new Docker en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment,
there's no way to pull an existing image from an external repo
that I could see.
We have some tools for deploying a Docker image to Elastic Beanstalk,
but they were so cryptic that I didn't want to pursue that.</p>

<p>Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters teaches three skillsets.
By far the best known is public speaking,
but evaluation and leadership are also valuable.
Learning to evaluate a speech teaches you to listen carefully
and to give useful feedback.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/speech-evaluation-3-modified-sandwich-technique/">Toast&shy;mas&shy;ter&shy;s' Sandwich</a> is the best-known approach:
point out several things the speaker did well,
suggest some areas of im&shy;prove&shy;ment,
and conclude with more praise.</p>
<p>The evaluator benefits too from the evaluation,
as they hone their listening and critical skills
and as they learn to give helpful feedback.
The audience also benefits,
as they hear both the speech
and a measured response to the speech.</p>
<p>Outside of Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters,
feedback is often negative and critical (&quot;Here's how you're fucking up&quot;),
which leads to de&shy;mo&shy;ti&shy;va&shy;tion <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/05/23/ToastmastersEvaluations.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Nick Sandman earned a Victoria Cross in the Falklands
and spent a year relearning how to walk.
Now all he wants to do is to restore <em>Sycorax</em>, his beloved old boat.
But to afford that, he has to work for TV star Tony Bannister.
Bannister wants to win the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.routehalifaxsaintpierre.com/new_site/contentframes/the_race.htm">St Pier&shy;re–Hal&shy;i&shy;fax race</a> with Sandman's help
and he wants to make a doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary about Sandman,
neither of which Sandman wants.

and her wealthy father holds Bannister re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;ble.</p>

<p>It's late 1990 and Saddam Hussein has just invaded Kuwait.
Paul Shanahan is an exiled Irish-American yacht delivery skipper.
He used to be a gunrunner for the IRA,
but rumors that he was a CIA agent have kept them at arms' length.
Now the IRA have engaged him to sail $5,000,000 in Libyan-supplied gold coins
across the Atlantic to buy 53 Stinger missiles.
It stinks but he can't say no.
And maybe he is the CIA agent that he's rumored to be.</p>

Tony Stark's hubris leads to the creation of a lethal robot with daddy issues.
Ultron, who is supposed to be the ultimate planetary line of defense,

He vows to destroy humanity to save the planet,
and in particular to destroy his maker and the other Avengers.

to sow dissension in their ranks, which nearly tears them apart.

<p>The Age of Affluence ended when the coastal cities drowned as the icecaps melted.
Many now eke out a living digging through the detritus of the past.
Nailer is a scrawny teenaged scavenger who finds a broken clipper ship after a storm.
There's only one survivor,
Nita, a swank girl who fled in&shy;ternecine feuding in her trading clan.
To protect her from his psychotic father and others who would sell her to her enemies,
they go on the run to Orleans,
with the aid of a “half-man”.</p>

when the actor playing Mercutio is somehow fatally stabbed
with an envenomed rapier during an on-stage duel.
He uncovers perfidy and poisonings
which stretches back for years and
rises into the highest halls of the land.</p>
<p>Tonkin has not only created a brilliant and dangerous pro&shy;tag&shy;o&shy;nist,
he has metic&shy;u&shy;lous&shy;ly recreated Eliz&shy;a&shy;bethan London,

    <p>Quick!
How many days between 2014-11-29 and 2016-05-17?
What's the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand on an analog clock
when the time reads 11:37?</p>
<p>The hard way to compute the difference between the two dates
is to start counting back months and days until you reach the earlier date,
or equiv&shy;a&shy;lent&shy;ly to count forward from the beginning.
(Don't forget that Feb 2016 has 29 days but Feb 2015 has 28.)
Similarly with the angle between the hands.</p>
<p>The easier way is to compute the number of units between the first point
and some reference (or base) point,
to do the same for the second point,
and to subtract <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/05/17/SubtractingCompoundObjects.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>Two tran&shy;si&shy;tions at Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters tonight:
Kim gave her last speech before moving to California
and Shasti gave her tenth speech,
which earned her her <a class="reference external" href="http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/toastmasters-speech-0-competent-communicator/">Competent Com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tor</a> award.</p>
<p>It's always exciting to see people proceed through a series of speeches
and achieve milestones like the CC.
You see them get better with each speech.
The awkward fumbling hesitation of the early speeches
is supplanted by growing fluidity and confidence,
as the practice and the eval&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tions help them improve.</p>
