<p>Tom Musgrave, sword master and master of logic,
is called away from the Eliz&shy;a&shy;bethan court to the Scottish borders,
where his brother has been found dead&shy;—ap&shy;par&shy;ent&shy;ly frozen in terror by the sight of a hellhound.
Musgrave uncovers a nest of intrigue and murder when he returns home to in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gate.</p>
<p>Tonkin has written a good historical mystery,
though I found the pro&shy;ta&shy;gan&shy;ist's ra&shy;ti&shy;o&shy;ci&shy;na&shy;tive powers improbable.</p>

The daughter's friend—Banks' own daughter, Tracy—goes to warn the owner,
and he goes on the run with Tracy.
She's willing at first then realizes that she's in way over her head with this bad boy.</p>

Truman Capote's best&shy;selling non-fiction novel,
describes the 1959 murder of a wealthy farmer and his family,
which terrorized Kansas;
the in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion by the Kansas Bureau of In&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion;
the arrest six weeks later of two parolees,
Dick Hickock and Perry Smith;
and the lives and deaths of Hickock and Smith.
Smith was a ne'er-do-well, brought up by footloose alcoholic parents,
with two siblings dead of suicide,
while Hickock had been brought up in a good home.</p>
<p>Capote “recre&shy;at&shy;ed” the events of the Clutter murder
and, in&shy;ci&shy;den&shy;tal&shy;ly, helped create the genre of <em>true crime</em>.

<p>Emma and I are going to spend most of June and all of July 2015 in Berlin.</p>
<p>Two years ago, our friend Joanna announced that she was going to spend a year in Paris
with her husband and daughters.
This got us thinking about spending a year in Europe ourselves.
After con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;ing Bilbao and some other cities, we eventually decided upon Berlin.
We had both studied German in high school or college;
Berlin is a vibrant cultural city, full of history and art;
it's a tech hub and a startup magnet;
and it's con&shy;ve&shy;nient&shy;ly located for travel within Europe.</p>
<p>We spent a week there last year in early August, <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2015/05/24/ABerlinSummer.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>I woke up this morning to the news that
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.liberties.eu/en/news/irish-marriage-equality-referendum">Ireland's referendum on Marriage Equality</a>
looked set to pass with a strong majority.
Tears began running down my face as I read the reports
of con&shy;stituen&shy;cy after con&shy;stituen&shy;cy voted &quot;Yes&quot;.
I'm crying again as I write this.</p>
<p>When I was growing up as a bisexual teenager in Dublin
in the late 1970s and early '80s—out to no-one but myself—it was hard to imagine a day like this.
Hardly anyone then had the fortitude to live openly as gay,
if they could pass for straight.
Queers and pansies and poofs were objects of derision and occasional violence.

<p>Fifteenth book in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files">Dresden Files</a>
series of urban fantasies.</p>
<p>Harry Dresden is Chicago's only pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al wizard
and the Winter Knight to Queen Mab.
Mab compels him to team up with one of his old enemies to rob an im&shy;preg&shy;nable vault,
a vault that belongs to Hades, lord of the Underworld.
Harry distrusts Nicode&shy;mus—right&shy;ful&shy;ly, as Nicodemus turns on him.
But Harry can stab backs too.</p>
<p>A solid entry in this long running series.
Harry is in&shy;creas&shy;ing&shy;ly careworn but he still cracks wise,
en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing the readers if not his an&shy;tag&shy;o&shy;nists.</p>

<p>Liza lives with her reclusive mother, Eve,
in the gatehouse of Shrove, a remote English country house.
Liza has never been to school and has been kept apart from the world.
When Eve is about to arrested for murder,

Instead Liza runs off with the boyfriend she had met recently.
She spends much of the book, like <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheherazade">Scheherazade</a>,

<p>A murder in Sussex bears sim&shy;i&shy;lar&shy;i&shy;ties to another recent murder in Scotland,
but what could the link between the two men be?
One of the victims left a half-written letter addressed to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/12/31/ReviewRiverOfDarkness.aspx">John Madden</a>,
who is now retired from Scotland Yard.
Soon there are more victims and Madden and the police struggle to find the killer.</p>
<p>Airth evokes both the First and Second World Wars,
exploring the damage done to those who survived
and the injustices visited upon some who did not.</p>
