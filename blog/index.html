<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">password managers</a> for at least 15 years
to keep track of all my passwords.
I have separate, distinct, strong passwords for hundreds of sites,
and I&#8217;ve only memorized the handful that I need to actually type&nbsp;regularly.</p>
<p>I started out with the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/02/06/200KeePassEntries.html">KeePass</a> desktop app originally,
but I switched to the online <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/01/07/DicewareAndLastpass.html">LastPass</a> app about a decade ago.
At work, we use <a class="reference external" href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>.</p>
<p>When I register for a site,
LastPass generates a random password for me,
such as <tt class="docutils literal">tV%5joS$U6^uY5xU</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">T2oEUY!g70Iv1b&amp;I</tt>, or <tt class="docutils literal">8kNHg9*<span class="caps">A5GMR9</span>%8D</tt>.
LastPass securely syncs my passwords between machines and devices.
Its browser in&shy;te&shy;gra&shy;tion and its Android and iPhone apps
mean that I rarely ever have to actually type any <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2021/05/10/PassphraseGenerators.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

<p>Having dealt with <span class="caps">GPG</span> last week at work,
I remembered that I had intended to write a blog post
about how we used <a class="reference external" href="https://gnupg.org/"><span class="caps">GPG</span></a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox">Blackbox</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jabberwocky.com/software/paperkey/">Paperkey</a> to store secrets in Git
at my <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2018/12/31/2018-review.html">previous job</a>.</p>
<p>We used Blackbox to manage secrets that were needed
during de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment, build, deployment, and runtime.
These secrets included <span class="caps">AWS</span> cre&shy;den&shy;tials, Docker registry cre&shy;den&shy;tials,
our private PyPI cre&shy;den&shy;tials, database cre&shy;den&shy;tials, and cer&shy;tifi&shy;cates.
We wanted these secrets to be under version control,
but also to be&nbsp;secure.</p>
<p>For example, we had a <tt class="docutils literal">cre&shy;den&shy;tials.sh</tt> that exported en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment variables,
which was managed by&nbsp;Blackbox:</p>

I read the first book when it was <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2005/11/20/AFeastForCrows.html">newly published in paperback</a> in 1997.
<em>Fire and Blood</em> is a new addition to the series,
but it is a prequel and does not advance the plot at all.
This book is a history of the first half of the
three hun&shy;dred–year reign of the Targaryen dynasty,
the dragon riders who conquered Westeros

I reread the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2017/01/01/ReviewWatershipDown.html">book</a> of <em>Watership Down</em>
for the first time in many years,
having originally discovered it when it was new

There&#8217;s a beautiful new adaptation,
an animated <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down_(miniseries)">miniseries</a> made by the <span class="caps">BBC</span> and&nbsp;Netflix.</p>
<p>This adaptation is largely faithful to the original book:
The brave young rabbits striking out on their own
before their home warren is destroyed;
creating a new warren on Watership Down;
the war with the to&shy;tal&shy;i&shy;tar&shy;i&shy;an warren of Efrafa;
the peaceful aftermath.
