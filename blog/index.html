<p>On 2nd February 1882, in the Dublin suburb of Rathgar,
a son was given unto John and May Joyce.
James Joyce celebrated his 40th birthday in Paris on 2nd February 1922
by receiving the first printed copy of his novel <em>Ulysses</em>.
Parts of it had already been published in literary magazines and
the book was eagerly received by the cognoscen&shy;ti.
It took more than a decade for <em>Ulysses</em> to be published
in Britain and the United States.
Censors had considered the book obscene,
but the courts es&shy;tab&shy;lished that it had legitimate literary&nbsp;merit.</p>
<p>For decades, <em>Ulysses</em> was poorly received in Ireland.
The book was considered <a class="reference external" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/the-year-of-ulysses-2022-marks-centenary-of-joyce-s-experimental-masterpiece-1.4766055">blas&shy;phe&shy;mous</a> and obscene by many.

    <p>A while back, I had extracted some code out of a large file
into a separate file and made some mod&shy;i&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tions.
I wanted to check that the dif&shy;fer&shy;ences were minimal.
Let&#8217;s say that the extracted code had been between
lines 123 and 456 of <tt class="docutils literal">large_old_&shy;file</tt>.</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
diff -u &lt;<span class="o">(</span>sed -n <span class="s1">'123,456p;457q'</span> large_old_file<span class="o">)</span> new_file

<p>What&#8217;s happening&nbsp;here?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">sed <span class="pre">-n</span> '123,456p'</tt> is printing lines 123–456 of <tt class="docutils literal">large_old_&shy;file</tt>.</li>
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal">457q</tt> tells sed to abandon the file at line 457.
Otherwise, it will keep reading all the way to the&nbsp;end.</li>

    <p>40 years ago this month,
I sat down at a computer and wrote a program.
(Or &quot;programme&quot;, as I spelled it then.)
It was the first time I had ever used a computer.
Very few people had used computers in 1982,
in Ireland or&nbsp;elsewhere.</p>
<p>What was the program?
No idea.
Just a few lines of AppleSoft Basic.
But it was enough to get me hooked and change my&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>I still get a hit when a little bit of code unlocks in my brain.
It&#8217;s quite addictive.
There&#8217;s always more to learn and to&nbsp;see.</p>
<p>I wrote more about this in 2012: <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2012/01/26/30YearsOfProgramming.html">30 Years of Pro&shy;gram&shy;ming</a>.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of 2021,
prompted by Russell Crowe&#8217;s defense of <em>Master and Commander</em>,
I began yet another re-read of the twenty Aubrey-Maturin novels.
Or, as the fandom would have it, another cir&shy;cum&shy;nav&shy;i&shy;ga&shy;tion.
It&#8217;s probably my fifth or sixth cir&shy;cum&shy;nav&shy;i&shy;ga&shy;tion,
since I bought the complete boxed set as a Christmas present to myself
in the early&nbsp;aughts.</p>
<p>I completed the twentieth book, <em>Blue at the Mizzen</em>, yesterday,
and also the few pages of the final, unfinished novel, <em>21</em>.
(I also read about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2021/3723742">120 other books</a> in 2021,
down from a stupendous <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2020/3723742">200 books in 2020</a>,

<p>I&#8217;ve read hundreds of technical books over the last 40 years.
<em>Crafting In&shy;ter&shy;preters</em> is an instant classic,
and far more readable and fun than many of the&nbsp;classics.</p>
<p>Nystrom covers a lot of ground in this book,
building two very different in&shy;ter&shy;preters for Lox,
a small dynamic language of his own design.
He takes us through <em>every line</em> of
jlox, a Java-based tree-walk in&shy;ter&shy;preter,
and of clox, a bytecode virtual machine written in&nbsp;C.</p>
<p>For the first im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion, jlox,
he covers such topics as scanning,
parsing ex&shy;pres&shy;sions with recursive descent,
evaluating ex&shy;pres&shy;sions, control flow,

when the median test time jumped by two&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/"></a>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">password managers</a> for at least 15 years
to keep track of all my passwords.
I have separate, distinct, strong passwords for hundreds of sites,
and I&#8217;ve only memorized the handful that I need to actually type&nbsp;regularly.</p>
<p>I started out with the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/02/06/200KeePassEntries.html">KeePass</a> desktop app originally,
but I switched to the online <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/01/07/DicewareAndLastpass.html">LastPass</a> app about a decade ago.
At work, we use <a class="reference external" href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>.</p>
<p>When I register for a site,
LastPass generates a random password for me,
such&nbsp;as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
tV%5joS$U6^uY5xU
T2oEUY!g70Iv1b&amp;I
8kNHg9*A5GMR9%8D
</pre>
<p>LastPass securely syncs my passwords between machines and devices.
Its browser in&shy;te&shy;gra&shy;tion and its Android and iPhone apps
mean that I rarely ever have to actually type any of those ugly messes&nbsp;in.</p>

[On her editor, Bob Gottlieb, who famously
“was always inserting commas into Morrison’s sentences
and she was always taking them out”]
We read the same way.
We think the same way.
He is over&shy;whelm&shy;ing&shy;ly aggressive about commas and all sorts of things.
He does not understand that commas are for pauses and breath.
He thinks commas are for gram&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal things.
