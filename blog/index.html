    <p>Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee for the 2016 Pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial race.
Although Sanders has not yet ended his campaign, he can't win.
I voted for Sanders in the Washington state caucus
and I still have his yard sign sitting in my front yard.</p>
<p>Unlike some diehard Sanders' supporters,
I have absolutely no qualms getting behind Clinton.
She's one of the most qualified candidates ever to run.
If elected, she will be on the right side of many of the issues I care about
and she will make good ap&shy;point&shy;ments to the Supreme Court.
She's competent and capable and gets things done.
Clinton has survived more scrutiny and more attacks <span>&#8230;<a href="/blog/2016/06/09/HillaryClintonPresumptiveNominee.html" class="continue">continue</a>.</span></p>

    <p>I wrote in <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2016/03/27/PreparingBloomsdayScripts.html">Preparing Bloomsday Scripts</a> back in late March,
that I was getting ready for this year's reading of <em>Ulysses</em>.
Our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2016.html">2016 Reading</a> is a week and a half away, on Sunday June 19th.
We'll be reading Chapters 3 (“Proteus”) and 6 (“Hades”)
of James Joyce's mas&shy;ter&shy;piece at the Seattle Central Library.
We had our first full readthrough at tonight's rehearsal,
one hour fifty five minutes.
Next week, our dress rehearsal.</p>

<p>I've bought only three cars in my life:
a new red VW Golf in April 1992, when I moved to Seattle;
an 18-month-old black VW Golf in April 2002;
and a 2007 Mazda 3 in April 2016.</p>
<p>The 2001 VW was still running fine and had recently passed the 150,000-mile mark.
However, it, like the 1992 Golf, had a manual trans&shy;mis&shy;sion (a “stick shift”).
Emma had a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mortons-neuroma/home/ovc-20202652">Morton's Neuroma</a> removed from the ball of her left foot around 2003.
It seems to be coming back
and she was having increasing difficulty depressing the clutch.

drivers need to change gear often.

A Kindle All Star author by the name of Joanne Clancy

Eilis O'Hanlon, one half of the pseu&shy;do&shy;ny&shy;mous duo behind Ingrid Black,

We attended the discussion,

The three panelists were
Rory O'Neill, aka Panti Bliss, out of drag,
the accidental activist who became the face of marriage equality in Ireland;
Mayor Ed Murray, an Irish-American and Washington state's best-known gay politi&shy;cian;
and Gary Gates, an LGBT de&shy;mog&shy;ra&shy;ph&shy;er, married to an Irishman,
who advised the Irish cam&shy;paign&shy;ers.</p>

<p>A collection of short stories and essays from Kate Elliott,
some of which are drawn from her various story universes.
In the foreword and the essays,
she discusses the cultural biases that
lead to the “male gaze” and male characters
being the un&shy;con&shy;sid&shy;ered defaults for many readers and writers.
These stories amply demon&shy;strate that good, in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing fantasy and SF stories
can be written with strong female characters and subtle plots.
(I already knew this; some in SF fandom still don't.)</p>

    <p>Yesterday, while at PyCon,
I whipped up a quick, brute-force answer
to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/housecanary/PyCon2016">House&shy;Ca&shy;nary PyCon2016 Progamming Challenge</a>
in a few minutes.
That was sufficient to pass the first two test cases
and win me a very pretty House&shy;Ca&shy;nary t-shirt.</p>
<p>The answer ran in <em>O(n⁴)</em> time, so it failed miserably on the larger problem sets
in the third and fourth cases.
I mulled it over and came up with an <em>O(n²)</em> solution that runs in reasonable time
on the larger problem sets.
On the second test case, <tt class="docutils literal">input1.txt</tt>, runtime drops from 5.2s to 0.2s.</p>
<p>I submitted my new answer.
I'll learn on Monday if I won the speed challenge.</p>
