<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think
“I know, I’ll use regular ex&shy;pres&shy;sions.”
<a class="reference external" href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247">Now they have two problems</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
— Jaime Zawinksi</blockquote>

<p>A Twitter thread about <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/nbashaw/status/1253186961482715136">very long regexes</a>
reminded me of the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/07/11/64bitWindows7.html">longest regex</a> that I ever ran afoul of,
a par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly horrible multilevel mess
that had worked acceptably on the 32-bit .<span class="caps">NET</span> <span class="caps">CLR</span>,
but brought the 64-bit <span class="caps">CLR</span> to its knees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever I ran our <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> web ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion [on Win64],
it would go berserk, eat up all <span class="caps">4GB</span> of my physical <span class="caps">RAM</span>,
push the working set of <span class="caps">IIS</span>’s w3wp.exe to <em><span class="caps">12GB</span></em>,
and max out one of my 4 cores!
The only way to maintain any sanity was to run <tt class="docutils literal">iisreset</tt>
every 20 minutes to gently kill the process.</p>
<p>WinDbg and Process Explorer showed that the rogue thread was stuck in a loop in
<tt class="docutils literal">mscorjit!Life&shy;times&shy;ListIn&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;or&shy;Block&shy;sHelperIt&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tive<GCIn&shy;fo&shy;Liv&shy;eRe&shy;cord&shy;Ma&shy;nip&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tor></tt>.
I passed a minidump on to my former colleagues in <span class="caps">IIS</span>, who sent it to the <span class="caps">CLR</span> team.
They said:</p>
<blockquote>
The only thing I can tell is that it is Regex,
and some regex expression compiled down to a method with <span class="caps">456KB</span> of <span class="caps">IL</span>.
That is <em>huge</em>, and yes <span class="caps">12GB</span> of <span class="caps">RAM</span> consumed for something like that is expected.</blockquote>
<p>With that clue, I was able to track down the problem,
a par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly foul regex, built from a <span class="caps">10KB</span> string,
with 32 al&shy;ter&shy;nat&shy;ing ex&shy;pres&shy;sions,
each of which contains dozens of alternated subex&shy;pres&shy;sions.
The string is built from many smaller strings,
so it’s not obvious in the source just how ugly it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never wrote a followup post explaining how I dealt with this beast.</p>
<p>The regex was used on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cozi.com/calendar/">Cozi calendar</a>
to parse ap&shy;point&shy;ments in everyday language,
such as “Ann/John Dinner out Friday at 8pm”
or “John’s birthday every Dec. 7”.
These would get translated into (possibly recurring) <a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545">iCalendar</a> ap&shy;point&shy;ments.</p>
<p>Some of the subex&shy;pres&shy;sions mentioned above looked like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">ordinals = <span class="pre">"1st|2nd|...|31st"</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">short_days = <span class="pre">"Sun|Mon|...|Sat"</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">full_days = <span class="pre">"Sun&shy;day|&shy;Mon&shy;day|...|Saturday"</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">short&shy;_&shy;months = <span class="pre">"Jan|Feb|...|Dec"</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">ful&shy;l_&shy;months = <span class="pre">"Jan&shy;u&shy;ary|Feb&shy;ru&shy;ary|...|December"</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">recurrence = <span class="pre">"((every|each)?</span> (first|sec&shy;ond|third|&shy;fourth|&shy;fifth|last)? "
+ "(" + short_days + "|" + full_days + ")" + ...</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve elided the in&shy;ter&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate values but they were spelled out in the original.
Some of the simpler subex&shy;pres&shy;sions were repeated several times,
nested inside others.</p>
<p>This all screamed <em>grammar</em> and <em>real parser</em> to me,
but the test suite also screamed <em>here be dragons!</em></p>
<p>I resisted the temptation
to rewrite the ap&shy;point&shy;ment parser from scratch with a proper grammar,
or to experiment with a real natural language parser,
though it remained on my personal todo list for the rest of my time at Cozi.
We were migrating from C# to Python at that point,
and the legacy ap&shy;point&shy;ment parser was one of the few remaining pieces
that prevented us from shutting down the .<span class="caps">NET</span> servers.</p>
<p>Instead, I changed the ap&shy;point&shy;ment parser code
so that it didn’t attempt to match the entire <span class="caps">10KB</span> monster in one go.
I looped through each of the 32 top-level dis&shy;junc&shy;tions,
manually performing the al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion.
If any one of those matched, then I had what I needed.
Reducing the regexes to a few hundred characters each
tamed the com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;to&shy;r&shy;i&shy;al explosion of back&shy;track&shy;ing state.</p>
<p>Regexes definitely have a place,
but do not try to implement a full grammar as a single regular expression.</p>
