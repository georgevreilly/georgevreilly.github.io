<p>Senator Patty Murray visited us at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cozi.com/">Cozi</a> this morning.
She was there to hear from small business people about healthcare reform
and she met with half-a-dozen local small business owners,
including our <span class="caps">CEO</span>, Robbie Cape.
I sat in on the meeting as an observer to take <a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/seahcr/PattyMurraySmallBusinessHealthcareMeeting">photos</a>.</p>
<p>We heard a number of&nbsp;stories.</p>
<p>Jason runs a record store.
When they decided to insure all of their employees,
it meant that everyone had to take a pay cut.
One guy didn&#8217;t want to take part, but Jason convinced him.
Weeks later, that guy broke his arm and ended up in the emergency room.
Not long after, the same guy had another accident.
Later he said that he&#8217;d have been completely broke without the&nbsp;insurance.</p>
<p>Debbie runs a restaurant on Capitol Hill.
She said that she was ashamed to admit that
she couldn&#8217;t afford to offer health insurance to all her em&shy;ploy&shy;ees—her margins are too low.
Debbie&#8217;s insurance broker told that her premiums are higher
because she&#8217;s in the wrong zip&shy;code—lots of <span class="caps">HIV</span>-positive people on Capitol Hill—and because she has a 60-year-old&nbsp;employee.</p>
<p>Jason&#8217;s self-employed girlfriend became pregnant.
They had to search hard to find a policy that
did not consider pregnancy to be a pre-existing&nbsp;condition!</p>
<p>Will has a self-employed friend who is a healthcare exile.
His friend has been unable to find health insurance in the <span class="caps">US</span> as he has diabetes.
Instead, he and his family live in France where they&#8217;re enjoying the French&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>Robbie firmly believes that it&#8217;s important to have great healthcare
for all his employees and their families.
But this raises his costs and places him at a com&shy;pet&shy;i&shy;tive&nbsp;dis&shy;ad&shy;van&shy;tage.</p>
<p>Karen is in her early sixties and has adult onset diabetes.
She has insurance by the skin of her teeth, some grand&shy;fa&shy;thered coverage.
If she lost that, it would cost $500 to cover her,
another $500 for her husband, and another $500 for her medicine.
$1500 is almost the cost of her mortgage.
She&#8217;s trying to take care of herself and hang on for&nbsp;Medicare.</p>
<p>Robbie was galled that Cozi&#8217;s insurance costs are going up by 25–35% every year.
Small businesses have no leverage to negotiate with the&nbsp;insurers.</p>
<p>Patty talked for a while about the work that her <span class="caps">HELP</span> committee has been doing.
They&#8217;ve passed a bill out of committee,
but the Finance Committee is still at work on their own bill.
Under the public option, her bill reimburses
half of the cost of the premiums to
companies with fewer than 50&nbsp;employees.</p>
<p>The public option would spread the risk across a much larger pool,
which should help drive down costs.
Those of us who have insurance now are paying about $1000 each
to cover the costs of cat&shy;a&shy;stroph&shy;ic care for the nearly 50&nbsp;million
who are&nbsp;uninsured.</p>
<p>There was unanimous agreement that the current system is un&shy;sus&shy;tain&shy;able
and becoming ever more un&shy;af&shy;ford&shy;able.
All present were in favor of the public&nbsp;option.</p>
<p>Patty is having a number of small meetings.
She feels that they&#8217;re more productive than town halls.
I can only agree.
She said that her office is getting constant calls from both&nbsp;sides.</p>
<p>Patty posed briefly for group photos, before leaving for her next&nbsp;meeting.</p>
<p>There was more, but that&#8217;s all I can dredge up from memory
at this late&nbsp;hour.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we posted an innocuous update to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.facebook.com/CoziFamily">CoziFamily fan page</a>,
“<span class="caps">WA</span> State Sen Patty Murray just stopped by our office
to talk about small biz per&shy;spec&shy;tives health care reform.
With more than eight of us in the room,
there was <span class="caps">UNANIMOUS</span> support for a public option!”
A <a class="reference external" href="http://www.facebook.com/CoziFamily?v=feed&amp;story_fbid=124714156370">firestorm</a> im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly broke out in the comments.
Our very own townhall&nbsp;:(</p>
<p>(Why Cozi?
Back in June, a handful of us,
including my colleagues Will and Mira and I,
<a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/06/27/TalkingToSenatorsAboutHealthcareReform.html">met with our rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives</a> to push for the public option.
We got an en&shy;thu&shy;si&shy;as&shy;tic reception from Patty Murray&#8217;s office;
less so from Maria Cantwell&#8217;s staff.
A couple of weeks later, our group put on a <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/07/10/SeattleHealthcareRally.html">rally</a> outside
the Federal building where both senators have their Seattle offices.
Then Robbie was asked to make a statement for a <a class="reference external" href="http://murray.senate.gov/news.cfm?id=315805">press release</a> from Patty,
which led to his being asked to host this&nbsp;meeting.)</p>
