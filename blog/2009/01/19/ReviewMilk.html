<p>Milk was a middle-aged closet case who moved to San Francisco in the early 1970s,
became po&shy;lit&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly active, and started running for office,
un&shy;suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly at first.
“The Mayor of Castro Street” was elected to the San Francisco Board of
Su&shy;per&shy;vi&shy;sors in 1977,
the first openly gay man to hold public office in the United States.
A year later, only days after the anti-gay Cal&shy;i&shy;forn&shy;ian ballot initiative,
Propo&shy;si&shy;tion 6, went down to defeat,
Milk and Mayor George Moscone were murdered by ex-Supervisor Dan&nbsp;White.</p>
<p>Sean Penn is convincing as Harvey Milk,
an ordinary man who became an im&shy;pas&shy;sioned gay activist
and an in&shy;spi&shy;ra&shy;tional leader, un&shy;apolo&shy;getic about his sexuality.
Both during his life and after,
Milk&#8217;s example leads other people to come out and stop hiding.
Milk&#8217;s relentless focus on politics costs him his personal life,
driving away first one lover, then&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>Josh Brolin plays Dan White, not as a car&shy;i&shy;ca&shy;tured villain,
but as a confused and angry man,
who has a difficult working re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship with&nbsp;Milk.</p>
<p>Van Sant has created a believable and gripping biopic,
showing the burgeoning gay rights movement
in the brief, golden decade between the Stonewall riots and&nbsp;<span class="caps">AIDS</span>.</p>
<p><em>Milk</em> is certain to earn some Oscar&nbsp;nom&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tions.</p>
