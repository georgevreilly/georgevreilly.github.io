<p>On Wednesday, I ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;nied Lyn to the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.funerals.coop/">People&#8217;s Memorial Funeral Co&shy;op&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tive</a>
on Capitol Hill to make the arrange&shy;ment for Frank&#8217;s&nbsp;cremation.</p>
<p>Years ago, I read Jessica Mitford&#8217;s
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mitford.org/rev.htm">The American Way of Death Revisited</a>
and it left me with an even lower opinion
of the funeral industry than I already&nbsp;had.</p>
<p>I had never made any funeral arrange&shy;ments before.
It turned out to be both painless and in&shy;ex&shy;pen&shy;sive.
The funeral director sat down with us and gathered in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion
for the death cer&shy;tifi&shy;cate that the doctor was unable to provide,
such as parents&#8217; names and other personal details.
Initially, we put down “Software Doc&shy;u&shy;menter” as Frank&#8217;s oc&shy;cu&shy;pa&shy;tion—his
final job had been a ten-year stint at Microsoft as a doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion
as&shy;sis&shy;tan&shy;t—but when we were proof&shy;read&shy;ing the printout, I suggested “poet”.
And so it was.
Frank published one book of poetry,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Eat-Slug-Frank-Maloney/dp/0914742140/">How to Eat a Slug</a>,
and I know he&#8217;d rather be remembered as a poet than a Microsoft&nbsp;peon.</p>
<p>The cost was $800, as Frank was a member of the non-profit People&#8217;s Memorial co-op.
It would have been a couple of hundred more otherwise.
I asked how much it would have cost at a commercial mortuary,
and she told us that a basic package at a well-known funeral home
a few blocks away started out at $3200.&nbsp;Ouch!</p>
<p>We were unable to view Frank&#8217;s body as it was already at the cre&shy;ma&shy;to&shy;ri&shy;um in Kent,
and that would have cost $150 extra to set&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>I also arranged a brief <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews37_02/page13.cfm">death notice</a> in this week&#8217;s
<em>Seattle Gay News</em>.</p>
<p>(Aside: the <span class="caps">URL</span> for People&#8217;s Memorial is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.funerals.coop">http://www.funerals.coop</a>.
I wasn&#8217;t even aware that there was a <tt class="docutils literal">.coop</tt> <span class="caps">TLD</span>,
but I learned that it was created with other <a class="reference external" href="http://www.internic.net/faqs/new-tlds.html">new TLDs</a>,
such as <tt class="docutils literal">.biz</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">.info</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">.name</tt>, in&nbsp;2002.)</p>
