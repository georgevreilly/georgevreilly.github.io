<p>Paul <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/opinion/16krugman.html">Krugman</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last Sunday President-elect Barack Obama was asked whether he would seek an
in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion of possible crimes by the Bush ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion. “I don’t
believe that anybody is above the law,” he responded, but “we need to look
forward as opposed to looking&nbsp;backwards.”</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but if we don’t have an inquest into what happened during the
Bush years — and nearly everyone has taken Mr. Obama’s remarks to mean that
we won’t — this means that those who hold power are indeed above the law
because they don’t face any con&shy;se&shy;quences if they abuse their&nbsp;power.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There’s much, much more. By my count, at least six important government
agencies ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;enced major scandals over the past eight years — in most
cases, scandals that were never properly in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gat&shy;ed. And then there was
the biggest scandal of all: Does anyone seriously doubt that the Bush
ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion de&shy;lib&shy;er&shy;ate&shy;ly misled the nation into invading&nbsp;Iraq?</p>
<p>Why, then, shouldn’t we have an official inquiry into abuses during the
Bush&nbsp;years?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Now, it’s true that a serious in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion of Bush-era abuses would make
Washington an un&shy;com&shy;fort&shy;able place, both for those who abused power and
those who acted as their enablers or apologists. And these people have a
lot of friends. But the price of protecting their comfort would be high: If
we whitewash the abuses of the past eight years, we’ll guarantee that they
will happen&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And to protect and defend the Con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion, a president must do more than
obey the Con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion himself; he must hold those who violate the
Con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion ac&shy;count&shy;able. So Mr. Obama should reconsider his apparent
decision to let the previous ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion get away with crime.
Con&shy;se&shy;quences aside, that’s not a decision he has the right to&nbsp;make.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Democrats, with rare exceptions like Conyers and Kucinich,
have shown no appetite for holding the Bush Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion ac&shy;count&shy;able.
Between starting the Iraq War, torture, billions given in no-bid contracts,
Katrina, the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Attorneys&#8217; firings, wire&shy;tap&shy;ping <span class="caps">U.S.</span> citizens,
and much, much more,
there&#8217;s a lot that needs in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gat&shy;ing.
And surely there&#8217;s more that hasn&#8217;t come to light&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p>Letting bygones be bygones just condones the crimes.
It will certainly be po&shy;lit&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly in&shy;con&shy;ve&shy;nient to have some ac&shy;count&shy;abil&shy;i&shy;ty,
but it&#8217;s the right thing to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to hold my breath,&nbsp;however.</p>
