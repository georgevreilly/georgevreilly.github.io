<p>I&#8217;ve always been a fast reader, faster than most people.
I&#8217;ve read and reviewed 176 books in just over two years,
or about two books a week.
That doesn&#8217;t count newspapers, magazines, blogs, and other online&nbsp;reading.</p>
<p>When I was 10, I had an operation on both my feet
and I spent all summer with my legs in plaster.
My mother had to go to the library every day
because they&#8217;d only let her take out three books at a time for me.
On the flight back from Ireland two weeks ago,
I read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/01/04/ReviewAbsentFriends.html">two</a> 500-page <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/01/03/ReviewTheSunriseLands.html">books</a>.
My personal best, though, was the long, long night that
I read seven short&nbsp;novels.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve known people who read faster than me, but not many.
One friend at college seemed to read about twice as fast as&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>I just tried a couple of online reading speed tests,
which rated me at 650-700 words per minute.
One of the tests also indicated that online reading
is slower than reading a&nbsp;book.</p>
<p>A reviewer for the <span class="caps">LA</span> Times read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hypnochick.co.uk/images/speedreading.jpg">462 books last year</a>.
I might be able to do that if I had nothing else to do.
She talks about ripping through an 80,000 word book in 90 minutes.
A number of the commenters claimed to be ultra-fast readers&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never taken a speed reading course.
I naturally developed a high reading speed.
My com&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sion and short-term retention is good.
My long-term retention is not great,
but this is equally true for movies that I&#8217;ve&nbsp;watched.</p>
<p>I think my high reading speed is why I have no patience for podcasts.
I can read five times faster than anyone can talk in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gi&shy;bly.
Unless there&#8217;s a lot of additional in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion in the soundtrack,
such as music or an unusually talented delivery,
I&#8217;d much rather&nbsp;read.</p>
<p>There are screen readers that will speak at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/business/04blind.html">triple speed</a>
for blind users:
‘To the untrained ear, the output is in&shy;com&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;si&shy;ble,
but it allows [T.V.] Raman to “read” at
roughly the same speed as a sighted&nbsp;person.’</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;on!</p>
