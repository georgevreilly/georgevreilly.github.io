    <a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/world/europe/25pope.html"><img alt="Pope Benedict XVI" class="right-float" src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/pope-benedict-saturno-hat.jpg" style="width: 225px;"/></a>
<p>The Pope has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/world/europe/25pope.html">reinstated</a> four ex&shy;com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cat&shy;ed bishops:</p>
<blockquote>
Pope Benedict XVI, reaching out to the far-right of the Roman Catholic Church,
revoked the ex&shy;com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tions of four schismatic bishops on Saturday,
including one whose comments denying the Holocaust have provoked outrage.</blockquote>
<p>Pam has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pamshouseblend.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=9203">more</a>. Newsweek has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/181721">context</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, the Pope said:</p>
<blockquote>
that saving humanity from homosexual or trans&shy;sex&shy;u&shy;al behaviour
was just as important as saving the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/22/europe/23pope.php">rainforest</a> from de&shy;struc&shy;tion.</blockquote>
<p>Shit like this reminds me of why I am no longer a Catholic.</p>
<p>I was raised Catholic in Ireland and spent eleven years
at a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's_College,_Dublin">priest-run school</a>.
It didn't take;
I had lost my faith by my mid-teens.</p>
<p>But even if I still believed in God,
I'd have a hard time being Catholic.
I don't have anything against Catholics <em>per se</em>,
and I've known individual Catholic priests that I respected,
but I can't stand the Catholic Hierarchy.</p>
<p>James Joyce said of the Irish,
“we are an un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate priest-ridden race
and always were and always will be”.
It's no longer quite true—many Irish people
only see the inside of a church now for
“hatches, matches, and dis&shy;patch&shy;es”
(baptisms, weddings, and funerals).
But it was certainly true in the Seventies and Eighties
when I was growing up.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church had a stran&shy;gle&shy;hold
on life in the Republic of Ireland.
Con&shy;tra&shy;cep&shy;tion was illegal until the Eighties,
and, when first introduced, was available
only to married couples with a pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion.
Divorce only became legal about a decade ago.
Ho&shy;mo&shy;sex&shy;u&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ty was de&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;nal&shy;ized not long before that.
Most of the national (public) schools were controlled by parish priests,
and most private schools were run by religious orders.
(Still largely true today, I believe.)
Until 1970,
no Catholic could attend the tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly Protestant Trinity College Dublin
without a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Dublin#Catholics_and_Trinity">dis&shy;pen&shy;sa&shy;tion</a> from a bishop.</p>
<p>Education, the modern world, the European Union,
out-of-wedlock births, declining vocations:
all of these have loosened the Church's grasp in Ireland.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eamon_Casey">Bishop Casey affair</a> (he had a son and embezzled for nearly 20
years to support the boy), the Irish pedophile priest coverups,
and other scandals shook many people's faith.</p>
<p>In the larger picture,
Popes John Paul II and Benedict have spent the last 30 years
trying to roll back the lib&shy;er&shy;al&shy;iz&shy;ing effects of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council">Vatican II</a>.
They've stacked the hierarchy with con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tive bishops and cardinals,
ensuring their influence will last for decades after their own deaths.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church is becoming in&shy;creas&shy;ing&shy;ly irrelevant,
and I welcome it.</p>
