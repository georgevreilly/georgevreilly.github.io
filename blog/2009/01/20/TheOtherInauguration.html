    <p>Twenty years ago tomorrow, I attended <a class="reference external" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DA1538F932A15752C0A96F948260">Bush Senior&#8217;s In&shy;au&shy;gu&shy;ra&shy;tion</a>.
By&nbsp;accident.</p>
<p>I was on my first solo trip to the United States,
having arrived in New York the previous week.
There I had purchased a 30-day unlimited standby ticket with Delta.
It cost me only $400, as I could produce my round-the-world&nbsp;ticket.</p>
<p>For no par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly good reason, I decided to start
the 30 days with a trip to Washington <span class="caps">DC</span>.
There were museums there and it was&nbsp;nearby.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t been paying close attention to the news, and
it was only when I got to Washington that I realized that
George <span class="caps">H.W.</span> Bush&#8217;s in&shy;au&shy;gu&shy;ra&shy;tion was to be be held the next day.
Even so, I had no difficulty finding a bed at the Youth Hostel.
It was the biggest deal in town, so naturally I&nbsp;went.</p>
<p>In practice, this meant standing on a grassy knoll
on (I think) Penn&shy;syl&shy;va&shy;nia Avenue for several hours,
waiting for Bush&#8217;s motorcade to pass.
It was bitterly cold and no one around me seemed to be enjoying themselves much.
My only real memory of the day is watching the enormous flag
across the street, fluttering in the wind.
The flag hung ver&shy;ti&shy;cal&shy;ly;
I think it would have lain like a crumpled rag had it been flown hor&shy;i&shy;zon&shy;tal&shy;ly.
Eventually, Bush&#8217;s car crawled past,
eliciting some cheers from the chilled crowd.
I left then, to go somewhere&nbsp;warmer.</p>
<p>I had little feel for Bush Senior at the time.
Reagan had not been popular in Europe.
We thought him a dangerous cowboy,
likely to provoke a nuclear war with the Russians.
I thought Bush was probably little better,
but I wasn&#8217;t par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly engaged in <span class="caps">U.S.</span> politics at the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>In retrospect, of course,
he seems marvelous compared to the <em>other</em> President&nbsp;Bush.</p>
<p>(Before I wrote this post,
I assumed that the in&shy;au&shy;gu&shy;ra&shy;tion was always held on the third Tuesday of January.
Actually, it&#8217;s been held on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration">January 20th</a> since&nbsp;1937.)</p>
