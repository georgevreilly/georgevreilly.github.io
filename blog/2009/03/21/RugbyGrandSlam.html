<p>I grew up hating rugby.
I spent <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2006/02/19/OlympicsRazorthinMargins.html">eleven years</a> at a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's_College,_Dublin">rugger-bugger school</a> in Dublin.
I couldn&#8217;t stand the game.
I was a small, unathletic child with no interest in sports.
Rugby, even the modified rugby that they teach seven-year-olds,
was violent and unpleasant and involved running around cold, wet fields.
I had a big operation on my feet when I was 10
and I parlayed that into an excuse never to play rugby&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remember when I last watched a rugby match,
but it was surely back in the &#8216;80s,
as I doubt I&#8217;ve seen one over the 20 years that I&#8217;ve been in the&nbsp;States.</p>
<p>So imagine the im&shy;prob&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty of my watching rugby today.
Truly a historic occasion.
But not just for me, but for Ireland too.
The Irish team won the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(rugby_union)">Grand Slam</a> for the first time in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/rugby/2009/0321/1224243225558.html">61 years</a>.</p>
<p>Some Irish friends invited us over for a big <a class="reference external" href="http://www.foodireland.com/recipes/Breakfast/irishbreakfast.htm">Irish breakfast</a>
and to watch the match.
To be honest, I was more tempted by the food than the match,
but I ended up enjoying the game.
It was a close game and a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/rugby/2009/0321/1224243225558.html">nail-biting finish</a>.
It was the first time that Emma had watched rugby
and she thought it was more in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing than the slow, staged plays
of American&nbsp;Football.</p>
<p>I was also reminded why I had never wanted to play rugby.
It is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rl1908.com/blog/hooligans.htm">often said</a> that rugby is a hooligan&#8217;s game played by gentlemen,
while soccer is a gentlemen&#8217;s game played by hooligans,
and the former was borne out today.
A dangerous, bloody&nbsp;game.</p>
