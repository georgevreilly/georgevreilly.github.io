<p>I knew three of my grand&shy;par&shy;ents; they all died after I reached adulthood.
My mother&#8217;s father, George Victor Clery, died 12 days before I was born,
on March 3rd, 1965.
I was to be named Vincent after my father, [Charles] Vincent Reilly.
Instead, I was christened George Vincent Reilly.
I was the first grandchild for both the Clerys and the Reillys.
I think I must have been a welcome&nbsp;dis&shy;trac&shy;tion.</p>
<p>Ironically, my parents had gotten married on his birthday,
March 30th, the previous year,
and he didn&#8217;t live to celebrate their first an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
The timing was partly in his honor
and partly because it was Easter Monday.
Catholics were not allowed to marry in Lent&nbsp;then.</p>
<p>I only know the man by repute.
He worked, like many in his family, in a bank.
His word was law in his household, but my mother adored him.
He was very sociable:
he&#8217;d invite clients to lunch in the bankhouse at the drop of a hat
and my grand&shy;moth&shy;er would have to figure out to feed them.
His mother was told that he&#8217;d not live beyond infancy and
his health was poor all of his life,
but he was no hypochon&shy;dri&shy;ac.
I see something of him in my uncles, Dick and Gabriel.
Certainly the face and the moustache; also the&nbsp;gruffness.</p>
<p>George Clery,&nbsp;1900-1965.</p>
