<p>Over the last few weeks,
I built a PHP ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion that <a class="reference external" href="http://approvereferendum71.org/create-a-profile-picture">overlays Approve 71 banners on profile pictures</a>.
The actual ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion is hosted in an iframe
and lives on a server in a different domain, <tt class="docutils literal">eq.dm</tt>,
than the main server at <tt class="docutils literal">ap&shy;proveref&shy;er&shy;en&shy;dum71.org</tt>.</p>
<p>This works fine in most browsers.
Then we started getting reports that it wasn't working in IE8 on Win7 RC1.
The iframe content was blank.</p>
<p>Poking around, I found the problem with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler proxy</a>.
The landing page on <tt class="docutils literal">eq.dm</tt> was supposed to stick some in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion into the PHP session,
then redirect to a second page at the same site.
The second page was in an endless loop, redi&shy;rect&shy;ing to itself.
In Fiddler, I saw a different PHPSESSID cookie on each response,
and no cookie in the requests.</p>
<p>After reading <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1003490/ie-8-only-has-access-to-session-cookies">IE 8 only has access to session cookies</a>,
I told IE8 to Accept All Cookies and the iframe content appeared.
That fixed it for me, but we could hardly ask people to lower their security sessions.</p>
<p>I created a P3P file for the second domain, using the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/p3peditor">IBM P3P Policy Editor</a>.
(<a class="reference external" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/323752/EN-US/">KB 323752</a> has more background on P3P and third-party cookies.)</p>
<p>IE now worked at its default security level.
Problem solved!
Or so I thought.</p>
<p>A day later, we got reports of similar problems with Safari&nbsp;4 on Mac OS&nbsp;X.</p>
<p>I sniffed the traffic with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>.
Same problem: the “third-party“ cookie wasn't being accepted by Safari.</p>
<p>Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/408582/setting-cross-domain-cookies-in-safari">Setting cross-domain cookies in Safari</a>
indicated that there was no reasonable workaround.</p>
<p>We overcame the issue up playing some DNS games,
which was only possible because we control both servers.
The second server is now also acting as a subdomain of the first,
at <tt class="docutils literal">dev.ap&shy;proveref&shy;er&shy;en&shy;dum71.org</tt>.
We used <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ini_set(&quot;session.cook&shy;ie_&shy;do&shy;main&quot;,&quot;.ap&shy;proveref&shy;er&shy;en&shy;dum71.org&quot;)</span></tt>
to scope the iframe cookies.
I've tried it in a variety of Windows, Mac, and Linux browsers,
and it works in all of them.</p>
