<p>I spent last Wednesday at Benaroya Hall,
attending the Seattle edition of Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow&#8217;s traveling <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-developer-days-conference/">DevDays conference</a>.
It was well worth&nbsp;$99.</p>
<p>Joel Spolsky, owner of FogCreek Software and co-founder of Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow,
opened the conference with a keynote about the
dichotomy of power and simplicity.
People are happier when not over&shy;whelmed with choices.
Many of the choices that software forces users to make
are es&shy;sen&shy;tial&shy;ly mean&shy;ing&shy;less to the users.
However, even though people want simplicity, they also want features
and different people use different features.
Powerful software sells more&nbsp;copies.</p>
<p>He argues that developers and designers should put in the extra work to make good choices
on behalf of the users: don&#8217;t make users feel bad about themselves.
Undo is better than a con&shy;fir&shy;ma&shy;tion dialog.
You are not in charge of what your users&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>Scott Hanselman spoke about <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> <span class="caps">MVC</span>.
We&#8217;re moving away from <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> to Python,
but if we were to use <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> again, <span class="caps">MVC</span> would be a compelling feature.
His pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion was en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing, if&nbsp;gimmicky.</p>
<p>Rory Blyth introduced iPhone de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment, in a tone of snarky am&shy;biva&shy;lence.
He mentioned the Stockholm Syndrome.
He stressed that Apple&#8217;s Design &quot;Guidelines&quot; are ef&shy;fec&shy;tive&shy;ly laws:
violate them and you won&#8217;t make it into the App Store.
Looks like there&#8217;s a lot of tedious messing around to hook things up in Objective-C.
At the very end, he briefly demoed MonoTouch, which seemeed a little less&nbsp;tedious.</p>
<p>Cody Lindley introduced jQuery.
I&#8217;ve done a lot of work with jQuery, but I still learned a few things.
He worked through five facets of jQuery: Find something, do something;
Create something, do something; Chaining; Implicit iteration; and jQuery parameters.
He has an ebook at <a class="reference external" href="http://jqueryenlightenment.com/">jqueryen&shy;light&shy;en&shy;ment.com</a>, which I just picked&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>Daniel Rocha of Nokia talked about the cross-platform Qt (/cute/) toolkit,
which runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
More im&shy;por&shy;tant&shy;ly from Nokia&#8217;s point of view, it runs on their smart&shy;phones.
Nokia has changed the licensing of Qtâ€”once very expensive for closed-source apps,
it&#8217;s now free for apps that don&#8217;t modify the Qt source.
Qt is for C++, but there are bindings for other languages, such as&nbsp;Python.</p>
<p>Joel Spolsky came back and treated us to a half-hour demon&shy;stra&shy;tion
of Fogbugz&nbsp;7, Evidence-Based Scheduling, and Kiln,
their new hosted Mercurial repository.
Not terribly in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing to me, but the conference was only&nbsp;$99.</p>
<p>Ted Leung gave us a rather dry Hacker&#8217;s In&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;tion to Python
from slides rendered unreadable by a poor choice of colors.
I&#8217;ve done a lot of Python, so I didn&#8217;t learn much new.
<a class="reference external" href="http://clemesha.org/blog/2009/jul/05/modern-python-hacker-tools-virtualenv-fabric-pip/">pip</a> is an easy_in&shy;stall re&shy;place&shy;ment that unin&shy;stall&shy;s;
<a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout">zc.buildout</a> assembles apps from multiple parts;
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bpython-interpreter.org/">bpython</a> is a fancy&nbsp;<span class="caps">REPL</span>.</p>
<p>Dan Sanderson talked about Google App Engine
and demoed building apps with Java and with Python.
Looked pretty cool and straight&shy;for&shy;ward.
We probably won&#8217;t go that route, since we&#8217;re pushing data to
Amazon&#8217;s S3, so <span class="caps">EC2</span> makes more sense for&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>Finally, Steve Seitz from the University of Washington
gave a cool talk on Modeling the World from Internet Photos.
Some of this technology ended up in <a class="reference external" href="http://photosynth.net/">Photosynth</a>.
See <a class="reference external" href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/rome/">Building Rome in a Day</a> for some&nbsp;demos.</p>
