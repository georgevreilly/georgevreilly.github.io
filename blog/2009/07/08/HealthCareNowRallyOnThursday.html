<p>A couple of weeks ago, a group of us <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/06/27/TalkingToSenatorsAboutHealthcareReform.html">visited our senators&#8217; offices</a>
to talk to their staffers about the Public Option in health care.
We&#8217;re organizing a downtown Seattle rally at the Federal Building on Thursday at 12:15pm,
where both Senators Cantwell and Murray have their offices.
It&#8217;s one of the large number of rallies that <a class="reference external" href="http://pol.moveon.org/event/events/index.html?action_id=180">MoveOn.org is organizing</a>
at senators&#8217; offices all around the country on&nbsp;Thursday.</p>
<p>Will sent out this email to a number of people earlier this evening
and I&#8217;m going to reprint it&nbsp;here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I think it&#8217;s fair to say that July is going to be the most historic and
con&shy;se&shy;quen&shy;tial period for health care re&shy;for&shy;m—per&shy;haps in all of history.
Never at any time can I recall has so much come down to just a few&nbsp;weeks.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
—Former Senate Majority Leader and Health Care Expert Tom Daschle, speaking today</blockquote>
<p>I am part of a group of Seattle residents who are passionate about seeing
quality, affordable American health care with a choice of private and public plans.
The health care issue is currently being considered by&nbsp;Congress.</p>
<p>The reason for the urgency is the timeline Congress operates on:
basically there needs to be a draft bill ready before the August recess
in order to get a bill done by the end of 2009.
If there is no bill by the end of the year,
it&#8217;s highly unlikely that a new plan will come together during Obama&#8217;s presidency,
and the issue will continue to worsen as it has
since the last health care reform attempt in 1993, 16 years&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m personally passionate about the health care issue
because I have a friend who is literally a health care exile.
He has diabetes and is an in&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dent contractor.
This is a lethal com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion in the <span class="caps">US</span>.
He cannot get private health care because of his &quot;pre-existing condition,&quot;
and he can&#8217;t work for a company because he is in a particular line of work
(advising failed states on in&shy;cor&shy;po&shy;rat&shy;ing American values on media laws
into their new con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions)
where it&#8217;s very hard to find a company who will employ him.
He&#8217;s even offered to pay for all diabetes-related expenses
in order to get a private health care plan, but no insurance company would agree.
As a result he lives in France along with his wife
(also an American citizen) and their two&nbsp;children.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also passionate because my Mom would like to retire
after having worked hard her whole life
(she&#8217;s a physicians&#8217; assistant at a nursing home),
but she continues to work in order to pay for the health care
to cover my Dad&#8217;s pre&shy;scrip&shy;tions.
I&#8217;m also passionate because my Aunt,
who is over 70 and lives on a fixed income
after having worked at a university her whole career,
pays $700 a month just for pre&shy;scrip&shy;tions because of
the &quot;doughnut hole&quot; in Medicare Part&nbsp;D.</p>
<p>And their stories are nothing compared to families
that have gone into personal bankruptcy to cover health care costs,
or had a loved one die because they couldn&#8217;t get preventive care,
early treatment or&nbsp;screenings.</p>
<p>Maybe you, or someone you know has had trouble getting the care they need
at manageable prices.
If you&#8217;re passionate about fixing this problem, you&#8217;re not alone.
But it&#8217;s not clear yet that Senator Cantwell (D-<span class="caps">WA</span>)
un&shy;der&shy;stands the scope of the problem.
She sits on the crucial Senate Finance committe,
but she has not come out in support of giving Americans
a choice between a public and a private plan.
She has some <a class="reference external" href="http://cantwell.senate.gov/issues/health_care_priorities.cfm">ideas about health care</a>,
but it&#8217;s not clear they are enough to really fix the problems
my family and my friends have.
And given the urgency of getting this settled in July,
time is&nbsp;short.</p>
<p>We need to push Senator Cantwell (whom I campaigned for, by the way)
to come out clearly in support of guaranteed health care for all Americans,
while giving us choice and control.
<strong>Please join us for a short rally</strong> in front of the Senator&#8217;s office downtown
on Thursday at lunch time (12:15p).
