<p>I mentioned <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/06/20/WhenVideoCardsGoBad.html">three weeks ago</a> that I had just repaved my work dev box
and installed the 64-bit version of the Windows 7 <span class="caps">RC</span>.
Nine or ten years after I first ported parts of <span class="caps">IIS</span> to Win64,
I am finally running my main desktop on 64-bit Windows.
With one exception, it’s been painless.
Programs have just worked, devices have just worked.
There are relatively few native x64 ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions,
but for the most part it doesn’t matter.
The cases where it does matter—e.g., shell extensions such as <a class="reference external" href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">Tor&shy;tois&shy;eSVN</a>—are available as 64-bit binaries.</p>
<p>I briefly flirted with using the 64-bit build of Python,
but realized that I would have to recompile several eggs as 64-bit binaries.
That was too painful and the 32-bit binary did everything I needed.</p>
<p>Building in Visual Studio 2005 is noticeably faster.
I’m not sure how much of it was due to ac&shy;cu&shy;mu&shy;lat&shy;ed cruft after 18 months on Vista,
but builds there were very slow.</p>
<p>The one exception was a major problem for the first week and a half.
Whenever I ran our <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> web ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion,
it would go berserk, eat up all <span class="caps">4GB</span> of my physical <span class="caps">RAM</span>,
push the working set of <span class="caps">IIS</span>’s w3wp.exe to <em><span class="caps">12GB</span></em>,
and max out one of my 4 cores!
The only way to maintain any sanity was to run <tt class="docutils literal">iisreset</tt>
every 20 minutes to gently kill the process.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/default.mspx">WinDbg</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx">Process Explorer</a> showed that the rogue thread was stuck in a loop in
<tt class="docutils literal">mscorjit!Life&shy;times&shy;ListIn&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;or&shy;Block&shy;sHelperIt&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tive<GCIn&shy;fo&shy;Liv&shy;eRe&shy;cord&shy;Ma&shy;nip&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tor></tt>.
I passed a minidump on to my former colleagues in <span class="caps">IIS</span>, who sent it to the <span class="caps">CLR</span> team.
They said:</p>
<blockquote>
The only thing I can tell is that it is Regex,
and some regex expression compiled down to a method with <span class="caps">456KB</span> of <span class="caps">IL</span>.
That is <em>huge</em>, and yes <span class="caps">12GB</span> of <span class="caps">RAM</span> consumed for something like that is expected.</blockquote>
<p>With that clue, I was able to track down the problem,
a par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly foul regex, built from a <span class="caps">10KB</span> string, with 32 al&shy;ter&shy;nat&shy;ing ex&shy;pres&shy;sions,
each of which contains dozens of alternated subex&shy;pres&shy;sions.
The string is built from many smaller strings,
so it’s not obvious in the source just how ugly it is.
I commented out the <tt class="docutils literal">new Regex()</tt> and my problems went away.</p>
<p>Regardless of how ugly the regex is, this is a major regression in the <span class="caps">CLR</span>.
This code has been working without blatant problems for two years
on the 32-bit flavors of <span class="caps">XP</span>, Server 2003, Vista, and Server 2008.
I’ve been meaning to try this code on 32-bit Windows 7,
but have been too busy.</p>
<p>(The original, long-gone author was apparently aware that the regex
is expensive to create because he runs a background thread to <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> the regex,
which should have told him something.
We’ll fix the code that uses the regex to do something saner, soon.)</p>
<p>All that aside, I’ve been happy with the 64-bit version of Windows 7.</p>
