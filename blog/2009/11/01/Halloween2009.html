<p>When we moved to Beacon Hill in 2000,
we were totally dumb&shy;found&shy;ed by the number of kids
who came trick-or-treating to our door.
In the prior two years, we had been renting a house in Walling&shy;ford,
and we had only had one set of kids each year.</p>
<p>We had about 100 kids that first year.
We were not expecting the onslaught and ran out of candy,
which led to Emma being berated by some pre&shy;sump&shy;tu&shy;ous mother.
We live in a relatively affluent block
and kids are brought quite a distance to partake of the goodies.
One small boy peered up at Emma once and asked her, “Are you rich?”</p>
<p>And so it's been ever since: Hordes of kids.
Even on cold, wet nights, it's never dipped below 60 kids.</p>
<p>This year, we had 150 kids.
(Actually 149 kids and one dog in costume.)
The doorbell rang every few minutes from not long after 6pm until 9 o'clock.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I started taking photos of them.
The price of the candy is that they have to stand in the doorway for a photo.</p>
<p>I set the camera up on a tripod with a remote control and clicked away.
You can see this year's set at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/emmasimone/sets/72157622706598280/">Emma's Flickr account</a>.
Photos from previous years are there too.</p>
