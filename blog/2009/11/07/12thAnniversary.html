<p>Twelve years ago today, Emma and I met face-to-face for the first time.
We had been talking on the phone for about three weeks
after I had answered her personals ad in <em>The Stranger</em>.
We might have met a little sooner,
but she was busy meeting the other guys who had responded,
and I was undergoing the <span class="caps">IIS</span>&nbsp;4 deathmarch at&nbsp;Microsoft.</p>
<p>We were both nervous and we each responded char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;is&shy;ti&shy;cal&shy;ly.
Emma babbled; I said very little.
She told me later that she thought that she had scared me off.
She hadn&#8217;t, though.
We had already talked several times on the phone and she had been less nervous.
I liked her and I called her back and soon we went out on another&nbsp;date.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, we were infatuated with each other.
By mid-January, I was spending most of my nights at her place in Ballard.
In February, I bought her a new bed to replace her broken-down old mat&shy;tress—&shy;some self interest was involved, admittedly.
A couple of months later, after she had been laid off from an office job,
I lent her money to attend some software testing classes.
Within a year, her pay had dou&shy;bled—one of the best in&shy;vest&shy;ments I ever made.
In August 2008, we rented a house together in Walling&shy;ford.
We were engaged a couple of weeks after our first an&shy;niver&shy;sary.
That Christmas, we visited Ireland together for the first&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The following years were less hectic but no less enjoyable.
Here&#8217;s to several dozen&nbsp;more!</p>
