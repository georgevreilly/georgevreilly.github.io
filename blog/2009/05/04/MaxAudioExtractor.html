<p>I blogged before that I had used <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/11/18/HardwareLazarus.aspx">Exact Audio Copy</a>
to rip most of my CD collection to the lossless <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Lossless_Audio_Codec">FLAC</a> format.
I haven't ripped any more CDs since then,
as the old Windows laptop that I was using had severe problems.</p>
<p>We went to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.columbiacitybeatwalk.org/">Columbia City Beatwalk</a> on Friday night.
I liked the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.correoaereo.com/">Correo Aereo</a> duo so much that I bought their CD.</p>
<p>It was time to figure out how to rip a CD to FLAC on the Mac.
I found some hints that it was possible to run Exact Audio Copy
in a virtual machine or under Wine,
but neither choice appealed to me.</p>
<p>One <a class="reference external" href="http://puddletowndesign.com/FLAC/macRipping">guide</a> rec&shy;om&shy;mend&shy;ed <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xact">xACT</a> over <a class="reference external" href="http://sbooth.org/Max/">Max</a> on the grounds
that xACT will tell you exactly where an error occurs on a CD,
should one occur, while Max only gives a percent encoded suc&shy;cess&shy;ful&shy;ly.
What you do if an error occurs was not described.</p>
<p>I tried xACT first.
It's a thin wrapper around various command-line utilities.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://puddletowndesign.com/FLAC/macRipping">guide</a> details a clunky process to rip a CD to FLAC.</p>
<p>Then I tried Max and I was greatly impressed.
The UI is polished for an open-source app.
It rips to WAV, then encodes to multiple formats if you want.
It can also transcode over 20 audio formats.
Max is mul&shy;ti&shy;thread&shy;ed:
it can be encoding a WAV from one track to FLAC and MP3 si&shy;mul&shy;ta&shy;ne&shy;ous&shy;ly,
while ripping the next track from the CD.
Exact Audio Copy rips a track to WAV, then encodes to FLAC, without over&shy;lap&shy;ping.
Net result is that Max rips a CD about four times faster than EAC.
A lot has to do with the hardware.
My five-year-old Windows laptop was not high-end even when brand new.
My two-year-old Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro was top of the line.</p>
<p>I no longer have to run a Python script to convert all the FLACs to MP3s.
Max puts both sets of files in the same folder,
so I had to write a small script to split them into two separate trees.
Otherwise, I'm very happy with Max.</p>
