<p>I complained a week ago about my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/06/12/DisplayDriverNvlddmkmStoppedRespondingAndHasSuccessfullyRecovered.aspx">display driver going berserk</a>.
I blamed Windows Update, since it happened within hours of a pile of updates being installed.
I upgraded to the latest beta NVidia drivers on Monday
and it helped for a while, but by Wednesday,
it was almost as bad again as it had been last Friday.
It was in&shy;fu&shy;ri&shy;at&shy;ing and I was both en&shy;ter&shy;tain&shy;ing and alarming my neighbors
with my cursing.</p>
<p>Today was the last day of a very busy <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/04/25/Sprints.aspx">sprint</a> for me
and at last I had the time to dig into it.
I opened up the case and took a look at both video cards—I have two dual-head cards connected to three mon&shy;i&shy;tors—and one of them had partially blown capacitors like those in the picture.
I removed the bad card and did some graphics-intensive things for an hour,
and the other card behaved flawlessly.</p>
<p>Oddly, until someone mentioned that it might be a hardware problem yesterday,
it didn't occur to me, even though a video card blew in this machine last year.
I came in one morning to find a black monitor, and when I pulled out that card,
I found that some of the capacitors had popped right open with stuffing protruding.</p>
<p>On general principles, I had been meaning to repave this machine for a while.
I've had it since December 2007
and it was still running the original in&shy;stal&shy;la&shy;tion of Vista.
I booted from a DVD, re&shy;for&shy;mat&shy;ted my C:&nbsp;drive, and installed Windows&nbsp;7&nbsp;x64&nbsp;RC1.</p>
<p>I finally have a 64-bit OS as my primary Windows desktop,
so I'll actually be using the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/05/07/Windows7X64RunningInMacVirtualBox222.aspx">Win64 build of Vim that I maintain</a>.
My first im&shy;pres&shy;sions of Windows&nbsp;7 on this machine are very favorable,
but there's plenty more that I need to install
before the machine has everything that I need.</p>
