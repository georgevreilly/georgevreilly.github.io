<p>I gave a poetry reading tonight, of <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2009/01/07/FrankRAJMaloney19452009.html">Frank Maloney</a>&#8216;s poems.
I&#8217;m working through a book of In&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;tive Reading projects
at Freely Speaking Toast&shy;mas&shy;ters.
I had to read some poetry for tonight&#8217;s project
and Frank&#8217;s work was an obvious choice.
(Had I remembered, I would have recorded the reading and made a&nbsp;podcast.)</p>
<p>Frank was most active as a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Richard_Maloney_(poet)">poet</a> in the 1970s when he published
his collection, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Eat-Slug-Frank-Maloney/dp/0914742140/">How to Eat a Slug</a>.</p>
<p>Six poems follow that give a taste of his work.
The material in [square brackets] I omitted from the&nbsp;reading.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-illiterate-calligrapher">
<h2>The Illiterate&nbsp;Cal&shy;lig&shy;ra&shy;ph&shy;er</h2>
<p>Frank was long interested in Chinese and Japanese art
and he used to paint&nbsp;wa&shy;ter&shy;col&shy;ors.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I am learning to write a language I cannot read.</div>
<div class="line">A few ideas get through:</div>
<div class="line">The character for heart beats truer than a valentine;</div>
<div class="line">For bamboo, the node is enough.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Use erodes the pictures like old mountains,</div>
<div class="line">Scrapes them clean as a hide,</div>
<div class="line">Clean as the glacier’s tracks, down to bedrock, the core.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">[Where I live all is new and getting newer.</div>
<div class="line">The cities, their people: a century is about all we can claim.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">[The Salish, the Nootkas with a longer reach,</div>
<div class="line">Like their cedar always renewed,</div>
<div class="line">Became their salmon.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">[Even the mountains still rise and stretch,</div>
<div class="line">Unfinished, raw, <span class="amp">&amp;</span> unreadable.]</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">Twelve strokes, movements: suspended needle,</div>
<div class="line">Playing butterfly, and phoenix-wing hook.</div>
<div class="line">Ink ballets make a few hundred radicals, the roots</div>
<div class="line">Of K’ung Fu-tze and Mao Tse-tung.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I copy out a com&shy;mon&shy;place by rote,</div>
<div class="line">Like watching the wave and not seeing the fish.</div>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">It could be spring back in England,</div>
<div class="line">If that is the direction;</div>
<div class="line">for all I know it is just around the dogleg in this road</div>
<div class="line">That does not seem to know its mind.</div>
<div class="line">Perhaps it’s behind a bush.</div>
<div class="line">I try not to step on things;</div>
<div class="line">England might be under a dry leaf,</div>
<div class="line">Buried in the whorls of a snail,</div>
<div class="line">Or it may never have happened at all.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I get muddled when I try to think</div>
<div class="line">But one does hear rumours. I am sure you must.</div>
<div class="line">How we got back.</div>
<div class="line">I read it in a book I found here.</div>
<div class="line">Seems I was real and you a character,</div>
<div class="line">But as for that I think we both behaved well.</div>
<div class="line">I grew up and died; you came back in sequels.</div>
<div class="line">Yet here I am; I know I saw you once</div>
<div class="line">Across a hedgerow. I tried to wave, to catch your eye.</div>
<div class="line">[The air’s as thick as boxwood.]</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I felt we had a lot to talk about.</div>
<div class="line">I imagine you were busy with some adventure.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">In any case, you did not see me or choose to wave.</div>
<div class="line">Please answer this letter. I am lonely rather.</div>
<div class="line">They did not let me take Dinah,</div>
<div class="line">And cats can be quite a comfort.</div>
<div class="line">You have Toto, and dogs are such great company.</div>
<div class="line">And your friends. They do not make good friends here.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">It is a pretty place once you get used to it.</div>
<div class="line">Things are much more here</div>
<div class="line">Than they ever were back there.</div>
<div class="line">A queer sort of hereness that makes it</div>
<div class="line">Thicker, taller, brighter, faster.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Sometimes I feel all shadows <span class="amp">&amp;</span> cobwebs,</div>
<div class="line">Just as if I were a puff of smoke</div>
<div class="line">That everyone wanted to blow away.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I cannot ever go away.</div>
<div class="line">I am beginning to doubt there is anyplace to go.</div>
<div class="line">Wonderland <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Beyond the Looking Glass</div>
<div class="line">Are the same place, like some great coun&shy;try&shy;seat:</div>
<div class="line">Wings, floors, tourelles, crofts;</div>
<div class="line">The maze, the amble, out&shy;build&shy;ings, the ruins.</div>
<div class="line">I know now it is all the same,</div>
<div class="line">The same small place.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">When you read this, stop.</div>
<div class="line">Do not let them push you down the road.</div>
<div class="line">Oh, I hear stories how that Mr Baum drives you all;</div>
<div class="line">The Rev. Mr Dodgson wanted a lot more from me,</div>
<div class="line">But I put my foot down.</div>
<div class="line">I was quite insistent I had done my share.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Plant your feet and refuse to stir.</div>
<div class="line">Refuse all en&shy;tice&shy;ments, all threats.</div>
<div class="line">They shan’t harm you.</div>
<div class="line">Without you, where would they be?</div>
<div class="line">Rusting in a woodlot yet,</div>
<div class="line">Mulching the cornfield by now.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">As soon as I finish this letter,</div>
<div class="line">I shan’t move again, not a muscle.</div>
<div class="line">Then we shall surely sift together</div>
<div class="line">Like leaves under some great ash.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Wait for me. I need to talk</div>
<div class="line">To talk to someone who doesn’t know any riddles.</div>
<div class="line">Your friend / Alice.</div>

<h2>For Peggy Maloney, 1915 -&nbsp;1991</h2>
<p>Frank&#8217;s re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship with his mother was &#8230;&nbsp;fraught.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">You hated your real name, Iva Belle.</div>
<div class="line">Was it too Southern for your northern life?</div>
<div class="line">Too rustic for the Hupmobiles and roadhouses of Boise?</div>
<div class="line">You never said why.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">So much you never told me; what did you think your job was?</div>
<div class="line">You knew guitar, never offered to teach me.</div>
<div class="line">Your first husband died impaled on his steering wheel</div>
<div class="line">With you trapped beside him.</div>
<div class="line">You waited until the last year of your life to mention it.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">You held your secrets tighter than an oyster its pearl,</div>
<div class="line">Than an octopus its crab, than a tree its ground.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Night and false dawn lit your lies and evasions.</div>
<div class="line">What rainy day were you saving your truths for?</div>
<div class="line">Did the Depression teach you to hold fast</div>
<div class="line">To the truth like a job, any job, whatever the wages?</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I admit you taught me many skills,</div>
<div class="line">Like how to be afraid of change, of novelty, of life.</div>
<div class="line">Your legacy: worry, insecurity, withdrawal, resentment, and un&shy;for&shy;give&shy;ness.</div>
<div class="line">I am your son, despite all my denials. When I am scared and nervous,</div>
<div class="line">My left hand flaps like a landed fish even yours did.</div>
<div class="line">I buy love  by forcing food on guests. I wield silence like a stiletto.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Did you know that I stopped liking you</div>
<div class="line">Long before you died? I assume I loved you.</div>
<div class="line">Sons love their mothers, don’t they?</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">You died long before your heart stopped,</div>
<div class="line">When you retired to your <span class="caps">TV</span>, Pall Malls, and Yuban</div>
<div class="line">In the mug you never scoured.</div>
<div class="line">To the apartment by the lake you never walked to.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">You dropped all the friends who wanted to be close,</div>
<div class="line">Waited for the son who only wanted to get away.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">You taught me how to be sad,</div>
<div class="line">How to waste a life,</div>
<div class="line">To pull back and grow a shell,</div>
<div class="line">To wait for high tide.</div>

<h2>Black Cats <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Broken&nbsp;Gates</h2>
<p>Frank and his partner of more than 30 years, Lyndol,
had a long succession of cats.
The two most recent are Princess and&nbsp;Blackie.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In the half-hay summer grass, a black cat rolls</div>
<div class="line">This way and that, relaxed, warm, and safe</div>
<div class="line">Behind a fence. The gate never latches on its own,</div>
<div class="line">Hangs slightly askew, is watched over</div>
<div class="line">By two tutelary aluminum cocker spaniels.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">These are com&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions not native to a black cat’s thinking.</div>
<div class="line">In the shade of the vast holly tree,</div>
<div class="line">The grass stays green enough to nibble,</div>
<div class="line">The shade warm enough to sprawl against,</div>
<div class="line">And a human hand close enough to scratch his head.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The black cat gets up, wanders off into the overgrown field,</div>
<div class="line">Exploring again what he has patrolled daily for five years.</div>
<div class="line">Routine is what he thrives on.</div>
<div class="line">Now is the season for lurking, for hunting fat grasshop&shy;pers,</div>
<div class="line">Not for fretting over broken gates.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The human sits in that same brown <span class="amp">&amp;</span> green yard,</div>
<div class="line">Sketches the broken gate <span class="amp">&amp;</span> its blind guardians,</div>
<div class="line">Preserving in his way the moment,</div>
<div class="line">Its still, black-cat perfection, not in the sketch,</div>
<div class="line">But there in its perfect absence.</div>
