<p>I spent much of today playing around with
the brand-new Jaunty/9.04 release of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.canonical.com/projects/ubuntu/unr">Ubuntu Netbook Remix</a>
on my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2008/11/26/Eee.aspx">Eee 1000H netbook</a>.
Previously I had run the Hardy/8.04 version of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ubuntu-eee.com/">Ubuntu Eee</a> on this system.
I had never bothered to update to Intrepid/8.10,
but now that UNR is fully supported by Canonical,
I thought it was time to try it out.</p>
<p>I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download-netbook">downloaded</a> the UNR image last night onto my Mac,
and trans&shy;ferred the image to a 1GB USB stick this morning.
(The <a class="reference external" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles/#Mac%20OS%20X">Mac in&shy;struc&shy;tions</a> required a little tweaking.)</p>
<p>I spent some time running the Live Image first, before clean installing.
Everything worked seamlessly except the <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/354620">microphone</a>.
WiFi worked, the webcam worked, sound playback worked,
the touchpad was configured in a sane way.
All of these were problems for me when I first installed Ubuntu Eee.
That they worked now was not too surprising,
since the Asus Eee 1000 is a <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport/Machines/Netbooks">Tier 1 supported</a> system,
but it's nice to get the con&shy;fir&shy;ma&shy;tion.</p>
<p>One of the first things to strike me about the Live Image
was how nice the fonts looked.
I'm <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2009/02/18/DramaturgyLaTeX.aspx">sensitive to typography</a> and
the default font hinting settings on previous versions of Ubuntu
have always looked like crap: spindly and awkward.
I found it hard to take seriously an operating system that looked so un&shy;pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al.
The Jaunty font hinting yields thicker letters,
which look a lot more like the Mac's shape-preserving font rendering,
though not as good.
The main exception, oddly enough, is the font
used in the netbook-launcher, which looks jagged.</p>
<p>I went ahead and installed Jaunty.
The installer offered me an option to install Jaunty
side-by-side with the existing operating systems,
Ubuntu Eee 8.04 and Windows XP.
I wanted to overwrite the existing Ubuntu partition
and I had to jump through several hoops to make that happen.
The partition editor is pretty and an im&shy;prove&shy;ment over GParted.
The timezone picker is also very slick,
with a clickable world map.</p>
<p>Par&shy;ti&shy;tion&shy;ing aside, the in&shy;stal&shy;la&shy;tion was quick and painless.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.jpierre.com/2009/04/installing-ubuntu-netbook-remix-904-jaunty-jackelope-on-eee-pc-the-howto-guide/">JPierre</a> has a useful guide to some issues that he ran into.</p>
<p>I've spent most of the afternoon and evening
installing various ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions that I care about.
Sleep and hibernate just work now.
Sleep worked before but there were always some obnoxious errors when going to sleep.</p>
<p>As a hardcore Vim user, I use keyboard shortcuts a lot.
Alt+Tab (or Apple+Tab) is my primary method for switching between ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions
on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
I had never found a keyboard shortcut for switching back to the netbook-launcher:
I'd always have to click the Ubuntu logo in the top-left corner of the desktop.
Buried in the Keyboard Shortcuts Pref&shy;er&shy;ences,
I finally found Ctrl+Alt+Tab, which shows a popup,
and Ctrl+Alt+Escape, which switches im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly.</p>
<p>Other random notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I had to rediscover <a class="reference external" href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=785263">ntfs-config to automount</a> my NTFS drives.</li>
<li>Useful apps like Skype can be installed from the <a class="reference external" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu">Medibuntu</a> repository.</li>
<li>It's necessary to run <a class="reference external" href="http://forums.getdropbox.com/topic.php?id=8695">dropbox start -i</a> before Dropbox will download the
real daemon and actually start running.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a Linux machine at work that runs Kubuntu.
I kicked off the upgrade from Intrepid to Jaunty yesterday before I left.
I'll find out on Monday how well that worked.</p>
