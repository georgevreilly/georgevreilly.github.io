<p>Esther Schindler has a post about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.javaworld.com/community/node/2500">in&shy;ter&shy;view&shy;ing your next boss</a>:
should a candidate dev manager meet everyone who'll be reporting to them?</p>
<p>Yes. Definitely.
If you want a successful, cohesive team,
there has to be trust.
A manager can make or break a team.</p>
<p>A new manager starts at a dis&shy;ad&shy;van&shy;tage,
relative to a new individual con&shy;trib&shy;u&shy;tor.
The new dev is expected to ramp up
and have time to build re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ships with the team.
The new manager has to build the re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ships as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If the manager gets to interview with the team
before being offered the job,
both parties benefit.
Why would you want to manage a team that you'd never met?
Shouldn't the team have a chance to reject someone
who's a bad fit?</p>
<p>I've in&shy;ter&shy;viewed “up” twice,
once for a dev manager and once for a CTO, at different jobs.
But those were the exceptions.
Every other time there was a change of manager at any job,
I was not consulted.</p>
<p>The two interviews were successful:
I'd work for either of them again.</p>
<p>The dev manager went through several hours of interviews with the team,
meeting us two or three at a time.
We in&shy;ter&shy;viewed developer candidates similarly.
We asked different questions of the manager, of course.
I remember asking him if he had ever laid off or fired someone.</p>
<p>The CTO got to meet the entire en&shy;gi&shy;neer&shy;ing team <em>en masse</em>:
a dozen or so of us grilled him for an hour and came away impressed.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> that in either case if the teams had made serious objections,
the candidate would not have been hired.
Certainly, in both cases, the teams vetoed developer candidates.</p>
<p>It may be tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al, but I think it's a mistake for companies
not to have managers be in&shy;ter&shy;viewed by their future reports.</p>
