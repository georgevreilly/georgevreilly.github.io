<p>On the 9th or 10th of January 1989, I flew from Dublin to New York.
That was the last day that I ever lived in Ireland.</p>
<p>I came to the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> on a tourist visa.
It was no lie.
I had a round-the-world ticket and I would go on to Australia in early March.
In June, I left Australia and traveled to Bangkok and Hong Kong.
Sometime in July, I landed back in Ireland to settle up my affairs.
I fit in a trip to the South of France with some old friends.</p>
<p>In August, I would return to America to attend graduate school.
I have lived in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> ever since.</p>
<p>I graduated from Trinity College Dublin in 1987 with a <span class="caps">B.A.</span> in Computer Science.
The Celtic Tiger was not yet on the horizon.
Un&shy;em&shy;ploy&shy;ment was high, as it had been for years.
There were some software de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment jobs to be had in Ireland,
but the pickings were slim.</p>
<p>After a couple of months, with some help from my former academic advisor,
I got a job at In&shy;ter&shy;Con&shy;ti&shy;nen&shy;tal Pho&shy;to&shy;Com&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion (<span class="caps">ICPC</span>),
a small scientific type&shy;set&shy;ting company on the northside of Dublin.
It didn’t pay much, but I got to write a text editor from
scratch—un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, in Vax Pascal.</p>
<p>My father urged me to go the United States and get a Master’s degree,
arguing that it would open more doors for me.
He was willing to fund it so I was willing to go.</p>
<p>I knew very little about American uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ties at the time.
The World Wide Web had yet to be invented.
I had managed to wangle Usenet access for myself sometime in ‘86 or ‘87
on the Maths department computer at Trinity.
(The Maths department had a student-run <span class="caps">PDP</span> with Usenet access via <span class="caps">UUCP</span>.
The <span class="caps">CS</span> department only let its un&shy;der&shy;grad&shy;u&shy;ates use an un&shy;con&shy;nect&shy;ed Vax.)
From reading the technical newsgroups,
I began to notice that certain uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ties were well rep&shy;re&shy;sent&shy;ed.
This, es&shy;sen&shy;tial&shy;ly, was how I decided where to apply.</p>
<p>The first step was to arrange to take the Computer Science <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Record_Examination"><span class="caps">GRE</span></a>.
This wasn’t held very often in Ireland,
but I think I took it in Dublin in the autumn of 1988.</p>
<p>I applied to six colleges.
I presume that I had the <span class="caps">GRE</span> results back by then, but I can’t remember.
I recall applying to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/">Brown</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/"><span class="caps">UC</span> Davis</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd</a>.
I believe the fifth was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/"><span class="caps">CMU</span></a>.
I think the sixth might have been <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eecs.mit.edu/"><span class="caps">MIT</span></a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/">Yale</a>.</p>
<p>More to come.</p>
