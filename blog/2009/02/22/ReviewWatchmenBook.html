<p>Set in an alternate 1985 where costumed heroes are real—and outlawed—<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen">Watchmen</a> follows six ad&shy;ven&shy;tur&shy;ers.
Rorschach, half-mad, continues his vigilante activities.
Nite Owl is retired and a worrywart.
The former Ozy&shy;man&shy;di&shy;as—the world's smartest man—is now one of the richest.
The Comedian is murdered at the very beginning;
after the Keene Act passed,
he was allowed to continue operating as a government enforcer.
Dr. Manhattan was trans&shy;formed into a superbeing in a nuclear accident in 1959;
he is America's strategic weapon in the arms race with the Soviets.
And the former Silk Spectre is his girlfriend.</p>
<p>These people are not boy scouts,
fighting for truth, justice, and the American Way.
They are flawed in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;als with mo&shy;ti&shy;va&shy;tions
that are often murky, even to themselves.</p>
<p>Who watches the watchmen? Who indeed?</p>
<p>The very presence of masked ad&shy;ven&shy;tur&shy;ers over the last fifty years
has trans&shy;formed society.
Dr. Manhattan is both re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;ble for many tech&shy;no&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal advances,
such as flying cars, and the locus of much of the world's tension.
When he disappears off the face of the earth,
desta&shy;bi&shy;liz&shy;ing the balance of power,
the Soviets im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate&shy;ly invade Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Rorschach meanwhile is convinced that someone is going after masked ad&shy;ven&shy;tur&shy;ers,
and in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gates.
He's right.
There <em>is</em> something going on—&shy;some&shy;thing un&shy;speak&shy;able.</p>
<p><em>Watchmen</em> tells a complex story,
weaving together many different strands into a tapestry
that is a triumph of the comic book.
The narrative moves back and forth across fifty years,
collecting many viewpoints.
And the comic within the comic–the <em>Tale of the Black Freighter</em>—ac&shy;cen&shy;tu&shy;ates the main storyline.
The artwork too repays careful study.
There's often two or three things going on in a single panel.
Truly, a picture is worth a thousand words.</p>
<p>Originally published in twelve issues, <em>Watchmen</em> was promptly re&shy;pub&shy;lished as a book.
It is one of the titles that gave rise to the category of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_novel">graphic novel</a>,
deserving the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award">Hugo</a> that it won.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(film)">film adaptation</a> will be released in March.</p>
<p>Highly rec&shy;om&shy;mend&shy;ed.</p>
