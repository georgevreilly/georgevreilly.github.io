<p>PLEASE JOIN US FOR AN HISTORIC DEBATE ABOUT IM&shy;PEACH&shy;MENT AND THE IRAQ
WAR, ON THE FLOOR OF THE WASHINGTON STATE SENATE ON THURSDAY, APRIL
19TH, 11:00AM. RALLY 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>We have one more week to move SJM 8016 to a vote in the Washington
State Senate. WE CANNOT LET DEMOCRACY QUIETLY SLIP AWAY. Democratic
leadership can still move SJM 8016, Senator Oemig's bill to in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gate
President Bush and Vice President Cheney, to the floor for a vote, if
they choose. Our intention in this campaign is to send our memorial to
the US Congress, not to let our bill rot in committee. We need to send
out a flood of calls and emails to members of the Washington State
Senate, asking them to move SJM 8016 to a vote. It is not enough for
our Senators to say that they will vote &quot;if SJM 8016 makes it to the
floor.&quot; We must urge them to actively advocate for a vote, and to lobby
their colleagues in favor of SJM 8016 as well. We need your help this
week, to convince leadership to move SJM 8016 to a vote. Here is how
you can help:</p>
<p>1. Email or call State Senate leadership today. Urge them to provide
leadership by moving SJM 8016 to the floor for a vote. Please tell them
that we can't wait until the next leg&shy;isla&shy;tive session to call the Bush
Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion into account. With our current con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&shy;al crisis, we
must insist that our Senators exercise their power and influence to
support and protect the US Con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion. Remind then that their sworn
oath to defend the Con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion is their only oath of office, and their
highest calling as a public official. The eyes of the country are upon
them now. SJM 8016 may be the most important leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;tion they vote on
in their entire career. The fate of our country deserves their
dedicated efforts now. We want our Senators to go on record now with
their votes. We need to send this message daily to all of leadership.
Here are emails for leadership:</p>

<p>2. Contact Governor Christine Gregoire. Ask her to support SJM 8016 by
letting Democratic leadership know that she wants them to move SJM 8016
to a vote. Ask her kindly to honor her own oath of office and to use
her influence now to restore rule of law in this country. We ask her to
protect us from the abuses of the Bush Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion. Governor
Gregoire has not received enough com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion on this issue. Let
Governor Gregoire know that opposition to SJM 8016 would show she does
not vigorously support the US Con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion. We want a vote on SJM 8016
so we know where our Leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;tors stand. Help us flood her office with
calls and emails all week long:
(360) 902-4111

<p>3. PLEASE COME TO THE STATE CAPITOL IN OLYMPIA TO ATTEND THE DEBATE ON
APRIL 19TH AT 11:00.</p>
<p>We will gather to rally at 10:00 am (details TBA). Our March 1st rally
in Olympia had 500 people. Let's make this one 1,000 and let the world
know that democracy lives in Washington state. As the second state to
call for im&shy;peach&shy;ment through our state leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;ture, we are providing
hope and leadership for the rest of the country. We must keep pushing
ahead, and keep im&shy;peach&shy;ment &quot;on the table&quot;. Every day that we make our
voices heard, we win another step toward restoring democracy.</p>
<p>Please arrange for trans&shy;porta&shy;tion with people from your community. We
are asking that people sitting in the Senate gallery wear something
&quot;Guantanamo orange.&quot; (Since signs are not allowed in the Senate
gallery, we will alert our Senators to our presence by wearing orange.)</p>
<p>Thank you for your timely response to this call to action. Your
commitment to the practice of Democracy has inspired me personally, and
given me hope that the good people of this country will prevail.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Linda Boyd Washington For Im&shy;peach&shy;men&shy;tx</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>FORWARD THIS EMAIL</p>

<p>I just sent the following letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Senator Oemig's bill to in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gate the Bush Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion is of vital
importance, and I urge you to bring it to the floor of the Senate for a
vote.</p>
<p>It seems clear that the Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion lied us into an un&shy;nec&shy;es&shy;sary war
of aggression against Iraq -- a war that has killed thousands of
Americans and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis; a war that has hurt our
national security; a war that has led us into torture and violating the
Geneva Con&shy;ven&shy;tion&shy;s; a war that has alienated us from our friends and
allies; in short, a war that we cannot afford fi&shy;nan&shy;cial&shy;ly, morally, or
militarily.</p>
<p>Surely this is enough to bring im&shy;peach&shy;ment pro&shy;ceed&shy;ings against the
President and the Vice President. We must have a full in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion.
The Oemig bill is one of the few avenues that can start this
in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion, since our rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tives in the other Washington are
not minded to do so.</p>
<p>I believe that this is not a dis&shy;trac&shy;tion, but the highest service that
the Washington leg&shy;is&shy;la&shy;ture can perform for the nation. The 2006
mid-term elections were a referendum on Iraq and on the President. He
has repeatedly shown his contempt for the will of the people since
then. In the remaining 21 months of his term, he may pre&shy;cip&shy;i&shy;tate us
into yet more wars, with Iran and Syria.</p>
<p>I urge you to bring Senator Oemig's bill to the floor, and to lobby
your colleagues to make this happen.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
