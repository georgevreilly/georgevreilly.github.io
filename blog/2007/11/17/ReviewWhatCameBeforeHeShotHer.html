<p>In Elizabeth George's previous book, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/product/info.jsp?isbn=0060545615">With No One As Witness</a>,
a senior police officer's pregnant wife is gunned down in London
by a 12-year-old boy in an apparently random act.
This book tells the story of how that shooting came to happen.</p>
<p>The three Campbell children are abandoned on their aunt's doorstep
by their feckless grand&shy;moth&shy;er, months before the shooting.
They are mixed-race children with deep-seated damage:
their alcoholic father was killed in front of them a few years ago
and their mother has long been in a mental hospital.
Ness, 15, is deeply alienated and truant,
and quickly becomes a drug dealer's girlfriend.
Toby, 7, is mildly retarded and attracts bullies.
Well-meaning, eleven-year-old Joel is his brother's protector.
Their Aunt Kendra is wholly unprepared, emo&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly or lo&shy;gis&shy;ti&shy;cal&shy;ly,
to become a mother to these troubled children.</p>
<p>Joel, Ness, and Kendra all proceed towards tragedy,
through a com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tion of bad choices, poor options,
inadequate coping skills, grevious mis&shy;com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tion,
and events that are beyond their control.</p>
<p>George paints an unsettling picture of a family at the edge.
Each of the principals is strongly drawn,
each one's actions makes sense of a sort,
each one's demons compels them to fuck up.
We know that ultimately Joel will kill a woman
and we watch de&shy;spair&shy;ing&shy;ly as he makes the choices
that box him in to his destiny.</p>
<p>Not easy reading, but compelling.</p>
