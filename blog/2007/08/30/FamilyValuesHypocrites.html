<p>I&#8217;m traveling in Europe at present
(Ireland last week, Italy this week and next),
so I have little op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ty to keep up with <span class="caps">U.S.</span> news,
but the Larry Craig case leapt out at me.
Craig is the second <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Senator
to be exposed in the last few months
as a major sexual hypocrite who espouses &#8216;family values&#8217;
but can&#8217;t keep his pecker in his pants.
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude">Schaden&shy;freude</a> is just the right term for
the pleasure I take in seeing these dickwads
hoist on their own&nbsp;petards.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Vitter">David Vitter</a> (brother of one of my professors at Brown, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Vitter">Jeff Vitter</a>)
repeatedly consorted with pros&shy;ti&shy;tutes.
Larry Craig has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.americablog.com/2007/08/larry-craig-gop-sexual-hypocrite-with.html">pled guilty</a> to soliciting sex in a men&#8217;s restroom,
joining the long line of homophobic Republican closet cases,
such as <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Foley">Mark Foley</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Haggard">Ted Haggard</a>, Mayor <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._West_%28politician%29">Jim West</a> of Spokane,
and Florida State Rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tive <a class="reference external" href="http://www.americablog.com/2007/08/if-youre-tired-of-posts-about-bob-allen.html">Bob Allen</a>.
The homosexual homophobes par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly irk me.
I don&#8217;t know what particular pathology drives them to be so homophobic.
All of the names that I just mentioned repeatedly went out of their way
to attack gay people, to deny them equality, to whip up fear around gay marriage.
Is it self-loathing, a hatred of their own forbidden sexuality?
Is it a cynical act of mis&shy;di&shy;rec&shy;tion: to be so virulently homophobic
that no-one could possibly think that they&#8217;re secretly sucking dick.
In the end, I don&#8217;t really care:
I&#8217;m just glad to see them taken down,
while enjoying the irony of the manner of their political&nbsp;demise.</p>
<p>I do feel sorry for those like Gov. <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McGreevey">Jim McGreevey</a> of New Jersey,
who sublimated their sexuality and hid in the closet for years,
but who did not hyp&shy;o&shy;crit&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly attack fellow gay people.
(Though McGreevey apparently abused his office and
sent sweet deals his boyfriend&#8217;s&nbsp;way.)</p>
<p>I have some experience of the closet myself,
as I hid my bi&shy;sex&shy;u&shy;al&shy;i&shy;ty for a decade before coming out.
It&#8217;s an ugly, fearful place to be,
and no-one should ever have to hide such a fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal part of their makeup,
but that&#8217;s no excuse for virulent&nbsp;homophobia.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://alan.batie.org/wordpress/?p=199">Alan</a> asks a good question:
Why were the police staking out an airport bathroom in the first place?
Sex stings for acts between consenting adults are a waste of taxpayer money,
and a way to punish closeted gay men by ruining their rep&shy;u&shy;ta&shy;tions.
I must say, however, that an airport bathroom
doesn&#8217;t seem like a smart place to get your rocks&nbsp;off.</p>
<p>Good riddance, Larry&nbsp;Craig.</p>
