<p>I worked at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/">Atlas Solutions</a>, a subsidiary of aQuantive, from October 2005
to July&nbsp;2007.</p>
<p>Google bought our largest competitor, Dou&shy;bleClick, for $3 Billion
in April 2007.
In the following five weeks, all the other major web ad&shy;ver&shy;tis&shy;ing companies
were bought up,
cul&shy;mi&shy;nat&shy;ing in Microsoft paying the stupendous sum of $6.3 billion for aQuantive.
The Microsoft-aQuantive deal closes in&nbsp;mid-August.</p>
<p>To put it mildly, I was not excited at the thought of becoming
a Microsoft employee yet again.
Cu&shy;mu&shy;la&shy;tive&shy;ly, between 1992 and 2005, I spent 10 years at Microsoft
as an employee or contractor,
including a year and a half on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_%28operating_system%29">Cairo</a>,
seven years on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIS"><span class="caps">IIS</span></a>,
and a year on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlexGo">FlexGo</a>.</p>
<p>Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, I had absolutely no desire to go back to being a Microserf.
I don&#8217;t like Microsoft&#8217;s business practices,
I&#8217;m sick of the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Microsoft">evil empire</a> vibe,
I&#8217;m tired of the hostility to Open Source,
I don&#8217;t want to work for asshats like Steve Ballmer,
and I have old scars from my earlier tours of duty
that trigger my fight-or-flight response.
I&#8217;ve done my time in the Redmond saltmines
and I just want to be a productive member of society now.
Microsoft is like a grav&shy;i&shy;ta&shy;tion&shy;al black hole:
it warps everything in its vicinity.
Life is too short to work at a company whose values
are fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal&shy;ly different to my&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary.
I know many decent people at Microsoft who are doing good work.
I applaud them, but I do not wish to rejoin&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that I think everyone should flee Atlas.
Having Microsoft on your resume is a definite plus,
and it&#8217;s the right choice for many people.
I think everyone should make their own cost-benefit analysis
and decide if they want to work for Microsoft or not.
I&#8217;ve written code that literally runs on hundreds of millions of machines:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/a2a45c42-38bc-464c-a097-d7a202092a54.mspx">http.sys</a>, available on all Windows <span class="caps">XP</span> <span class="caps">SP2</span> machines, Windows Server 2003, and Vista.
There are few other companies where you can have that kind of&nbsp;reach.</p>
<p>However, Microsoft and Atlas have very different corporate cultures.
Microsoft is a hard-assed, hard-driving culture.
Atlas has a far more reasonable pro-work-life-balance culture.
I&#8217;ve seen several alpha-male types being rejected by
the team-fit interviews at Atlas
who would have fit in just fine at&nbsp;Microsoft.</p>
<p>Microsoft claim that they will make few changes to aQuantive and Atlas.
Certainly, they would be incredibly foolish
to kill the golden goose after spending such an enormous amount.
I really hope they have the sense to leave well enough&nbsp;alone.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m not going to find out first hand.
I spent a few weeks looking around in June,
and I found a new position at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cozi.com/">Cozi.com</a>.
My last day at Atlas was Friday, July 27th.
I&#8217;ll miss my old team in Emerging Media.
They were the best team that I ever worked on,
and I&#8217;m proud of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/services_ondemand.aspx">Video-on-Demand</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/services_instream.aspx">In-Stream web video</a>
products that we&nbsp;built.</p>
<p>My criteria for a new job were that
it should be a small company,
somewhere in downtown Seattle or Fremont,
within an easy bus ride of my home in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beacon_Hill%2C_Seattle%2C_Washington">Beacon Hill</a>,
doing something reasonably in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing.
From 1992 to 2005, all my jobs were on the Eastside,
while I lived in Seattle proper.
I never, ever want to commute across Lake Washington again.
Atlas has 300 or 400 employees, aQuantive has 2600,
and Microsoft has 78,000.
I wanted a small company,
where it&#8217;s really possible to make a&nbsp;difference.</p>
<p>On Monday, August 6th, I&#8217;ll be starting work at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cozi.com/">Cozi.com</a>,
building groupware products for families:
shared calendars, lists, messages, photos, Outlook in&shy;te&shy;gra&shy;tion, and so on.
Cozi is in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_Tower">Smith Tower</a>, three blocks from
Atlas&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Square%2C_Seattle%2C_Washington">Pioneer Square</a> location.
Cozi is a two-year-old startup with 18 people when I signed on,
and they flattered me by ag&shy;gres&shy;sive&shy;ly pursuing me.
I have high hopes that it&#8217;s going to work&nbsp;out.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozi">Cozi</a> recently raised $4 million in a <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/venture/archives/117596.asp">second round</a> of angel financing.
We consider our biggest competitor to be pencil and paper
and we like to consider ourselves as a <a class="reference external" href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/brierdudley/2003578591_brier19.html">digital re&shy;frig&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tor magnet</a>.
The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://solution.allthingsd.com/20070404/synch-family-schedules/">Mossberg Solution</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://lifehacker.com/software/family/keep-your-family-in-sync-with-cozi-249722.php">Lifehacker</a>
have favorable reviews of the released product.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.podtech.net/home/search/Cozi">Pod&shy;Ven&shy;ture&shy;Zone</a> has a multipart interview (mostly tran&shy;scribed)
with Robbie Cape, Cozi&#8217;s <span class="caps">CEO</span> and&nbsp;co-founder.</p>
<p>Cozi&#8217;s vacation policy is 2+2.
Everyone gets two weeks off when they choose,
and the company closes for a week at Christmas
and a week in August (this week).
I&#8217;ve spent the last week doing a lot of cycling around the Seattle area.
We&#8217;re going to Ireland and Italy at the end of August,
and Emma couldn&#8217;t take any more time&nbsp;off.</p>
<p>Back to work next week.
Wish me&nbsp;luck.</p>
