<p>I&#8217;m slightly more hopeful this week about not <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/02/02/AttackingIran.html">Attacking Iran</a>
after reading this piece, subtitled <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/index.mhtml?emx=x&amp;pid=164164">Thelma and Louise Im&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;al&shy;ism</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You only have to pick up the morning paper to find the most mainstream
of official types in an over-the-top mode that, bare months ago, would
have been confined to the distant pe&shy;riph&shy;eries of political argument.
There&#8217;s Senator Joe Biden, the very definition of a mainstream man,
grilling Secretary of State Con&shy;doleez&shy;za Rice about whether she believes
the ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion already has the authority to attack Iran and
swearing, if she does, that it &quot;will generate a con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&shy;al
con&shy;fronta&shy;tion in the Senate, I predict to you.&quot; (You can add the
ex&shy;cla&shy;ma&shy;tion point to that comment or to similar ones from the likes of
Senators James Webb and Chuck Hagel among&nbsp;others.)</p>
<p>&#8230;-</p>
<p>Former officials are now crawling out of the Washington woodwork to
denounce Bush/Cheney policy in Iraq and Iran with the fervor (however
masked by official Washington language) of an&nbsp;exorcism.</p>
<p>&#8230;-</p>
<p>But it took more than [the work of Sy Hersh, Ray McGovern, and others]
for so much of official Washington to
panic. It took the ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion&#8217;s decision to send the <span class="caps">USS</span> John C.
Stennis, a second aircraft carrier task force into the Persian Gulf
(with hints that a third could follow); it took the an&shy;nounce&shy;ment of
what Juan Cole has termed George Bush&#8217;s &quot;fatwa,&quot; allowing the <span class="caps">U.S.
</span>military to take out Iranian agents anywhere in Iraq (&quot;Announcing open
hunting season on all Iranian visitors to Iraq,&quot; Cole wrote, &quot;is like
playing Frisbee with ni&shy;tro&shy;glyc&shy;erin. Bush has gone looking for trouble
and is likely to find it&#8230;&quot;); it took the detention by <span class="caps">U.S.</span> forces of
various Iranian officials in Iraq and the invasion of an Iranian office
in Irbil in Iraqi Kurdistan;&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but only&nbsp;slightly:</p>
<blockquote>
So feel free to imitate official Washington. Be scared, very scared. An
attack on Iran, if it were to happen, promises a special mixture of two
fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;talisms deeply engrained in our top political and military
officials that may, in the end, combine into a single lethal brew &#8211;
and that will, in the bargain, give American policy in the Middle East
the full-blown look of a war on Islam. Though our President is a
Christian fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal&shy;ist, neither of these Washington fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;talisms
are, in the normal sense, religious or par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly Christian.</blockquote>
