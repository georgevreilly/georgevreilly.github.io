<p>My laptop scared the crap out of me last night.
I came home to find it in a completely un&shy;re&shy;spon&shy;sive state:
it would not wake up. The hard disk LED was a solid green.
I power cycled it and it refused to boot.</p>
<p>It did, however, boot from a Kubuntu Edgy CD,
but it did not recognize the hard disk.
In des&shy;per&shy;a&shy;tion, I booted into the BIOS and played with the disk-related menus.
That fixed the problem, but I don't know what went wrong,
and my faith is shaken in the re&shy;li&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty of this system.</p>
<p>I bought the laptop just over three years ago,
shortly before I quit Microsoft,
as a re&shy;place&shy;ment for the work laptop that I had been using.
It's served me well. I have a reasonably beefy desktop system
of the same age, but I almost always use the laptop instead.
It's a Compaq Presario X1012QV, with a 1.3GHz Centrino,
a WXGA screen, 35GB hard disk, and 1280MB RAM.
It had 512MB RAM originally, but I replaced one of the 256MB sticks
with a 1GB stick last year, making it more pleasant to use.</p>
<p>For several months now, I've been planning to buy a new Vista-ready laptop this spring,
with a Core 2 Duo, ~100GB disk, and 2+GB RAM.
I want a 64-bit CPU so that I can oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly run Win64;
e.g., to update the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2006/04/22/Win64PortOfVim.html">Win64 port of Vim</a>.
I'm severely tempted by Apple and expect to end up with some kind of
Mac laptop — my first ever Mac.
I was hoping to hold out until Mac OSX 10.5 (Leopard) comes
out sometime this spring, but the latest <a class="reference external" href="http://www.macosrumors.com/20070125-2A.html">rumors</a> say that it's
&quot;edging the very limit of the definition of 'Spring' — i.e. mid-June&quot;.
If the Presario craps out on me again, I'll replace it in short order.</p>
<p>Whether I go with Mac or stick with a PC, I'll continue to run multiple
OSes. Kubuntu Linux has been my primary operating system since last June,
and I think it's unlikely that Vista will replace it. OSX may well do so.</p>
