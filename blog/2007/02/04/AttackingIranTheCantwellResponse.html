<p>I got a reply from Maria Cantwell&#8217;s office, regarding the email that I sent
about <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/02/02/AttackingIran.html">Attacking Iran</a>. Clearly no brain cells were used in sending out
this form&nbsp;response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr.&nbsp;Reilly,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns for the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of
nuclear weapons in Iran.  I appreciate hearing from you on this important&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>As you may know, in&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al nuclear inspectors continue to monitor
whether Iran is developing nuclear weapons.  Such a program would be in
con&shy;tra&shy;ven&shy;tion to the nuclear non-pro&shy;lif&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion agreement that Iran has
signed.  In November 2004, the countries of Britain, France, and Germany
negotiated an agreement with Iran, in which Iran agreed to cancel its
nuclear programs.  Un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly, Iran has recently backed away from its
com&shy;mit&shy;ments.  The In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al Atomic Energy Agency (<span class="caps">IAEA</span>) has reported
that Iran is ac&shy;cel&shy;er&shy;at&shy;ing its nuclear fuel enrichment activities and has
failed to comply with in&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al nuclear inspectors.  Specif&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly, Iran
began resuming uranium conversion in August 2005 and then announced its
intentions to begin research on enriching uranium in February&nbsp;2006.</p>
<p>On March 29, 2006, the United Nations Security Council issued a
Pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial Statement on Iran &#8216;s nuclear programs requesting that Iran
suspend its uranium enrichment programs within 30 days and cooperate with
the <span class="caps">IAEA</span>. Iran failed to comply with this Pres&shy;i&shy;den&shy;tial&nbsp;Statement.</p>
<p>On May 31, 2006 the Bush Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion decided to change course and join
diplomatic talks with Iran, along with the United Kingdom, France, and
Germany. I believe that the United States must engage in real diplomacy
and work with Russia, China, and other countries to deal with Iran. We
cannot permit Iran to build or acquire nuclear&nbsp;weapons.</p>
<p>During the debate on the Defense Au&shy;tho&shy;riza&shy;tion bill, Senator Joseph Biden
(D-<span class="caps">DE</span>) introduced an amendment calling on Iran to suspend its enrichment
program and to cooperate with the In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al Atomic Energy Agency. The
amendment was agreed to, with my support, in a vote of 99 to&nbsp;0.</p>
<p>Please be assured that I will continue to press for progress towards a
verifiable diplomatic&nbsp;solution.</p>
<p>Thank you again for contacting me to share your thoughts on this matter.
Finally, you may be interested in signing up for my weekly update for
Washington state residents. Every Monday, I provide a brief outline about

United States&nbsp;Senator</p>

<p>I hate phoning politi&shy;cians&#8217; offices, but clearly email isn&#8217;t achieving&nbsp;much.</p>
