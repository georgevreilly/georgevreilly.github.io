<p>Last year, the Washington State Supreme Court handed down its
wrong&shy;head&shy;ed <a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2006/07/27/NoSameSexMarriagesInWashingtonStateYet.aspx">decision on same-sex marriage</a>.</p>
<p>In a delightful piece of political theater,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wa-doma.org/">WA-DOMA</a> has just filed ballot initiative I-957:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If passed by Washington voters, the Defense of Marriage Initiative
would:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>add the phrase, “who are capable of having children with one
another” to the legal definition of marriage;</li>
<li>require that couples married in Washington file proof of
pro&shy;cre&shy;ation within three years of the date of marriage or
have their marriage au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly annulled;</li>
<li>require that couples married out of state file proof of
pro&shy;cre&shy;ation within three years of the date of marriage or
have their marriage classed as “un&shy;rec&shy;og&shy;nized;”</li>
<li>establish a process for filing proof of pro&shy;cre&shy;ation; and</li>
<li>make it a criminal act for people in an
un&shy;rec&shy;og&shy;nized marriage to receive marriage
benefits.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The intent is to challenge the court's ruling which declares that
a “le&shy;git&shy;i&shy;mate state interest” allows the court to limit marriage
to those couples able to have and raise children together,
and hence it is per&shy;mis&shy;si&shy;ble to bar same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>The initiative attacks the specious rationale for the court's ruling.
It also attacks the framing that so many of the bigots use.</p>
<p>Three ini&shy;tia&shy;tives are planned:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Make pro&shy;cre&shy;ation a re&shy;quire&shy;ment for legal marriage.</li>
<li>Prohibit divorce or legal separation when there are children.</li>
<li>Make the act of having a child together the equivalent of
a legal ceremony.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As the sponsor of I-957 freely admits in his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wa-doma.org/news/S20070125.aspx">rationale</a>,
these are all absurd, and if passed, would be struck down by the
Washington Supreme Court. He intends to undermine the reasoning
of social con&shy;ser&shy;v&shy;a&shy;tives who have long claimed that pro&shy;cre&shy;ation
is the sole purpose of marriage.</p>
<p>I'll sign the petition as soon as I get my hands on one,
even though my own marriage would be annulled by the terms
of the initiative.</p>
