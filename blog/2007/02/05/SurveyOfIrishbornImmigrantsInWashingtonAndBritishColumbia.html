<p>In last week&#8217;s newsletter from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishclub.org/">Irish Heritage Club</a>,
I read about a survey of Irish-born residents of Washington&nbsp;state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="mailto:SEATTLE-NEWS@IRISHCLUB.ORG"><span class="caps">SEATTLE</span>-<span class="caps">NEWS</span>&#64;<span class="caps">IRISHCLUB</span>.<span class="caps">ORG</span></a>, <span class="caps">FRIDAY</span>, <span class="caps">JANUARY</span> 26, 2007,&nbsp;<span class="caps">PART</span>-1</p>
<p><span class="caps">IRISH</span> <span class="caps">SURVEY</span> - Irish-born residents of Washington State are being asked to
complete a 32-question survey in connection with a PhD. research project
sponsored by Seattle&#8217;s Irish Im&shy;mi&shy;gra&shy;tion Support Group. The goal is to take
a snapshot of Irish-born people living in the Seattle area who left Ireland
in the 1900s, mostly those who left Ireland after <span class="caps">WW</span>-<span class="caps">II</span>. If you or someone
you know is willing to par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pate, please contact Melissa at 206-229-8512
or <a class="reference external" href="mailto:melissae@irishclub.org">melissae&#64;irishclub.org</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I filled it out and emailed it back to her; it was fairly painless.
I just spent some time with Melissa in an (optional) follow-on&nbsp;interview.</p>
<p>As she says in the&nbsp;survey:</p>
<blockquote>
If you look at the history, traditions and stories about the Irish in
America, much of it comes from the east coast and the post-Famine era.
The condensed version is that people left Ireland to get away from the
oppression of the British, the lack of economic op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;ni&shy;ties, and to
work to send money to their families in Ireland. Once in the <span class="caps">US</span>, Irish
immigrants faced dis&shy;crim&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion based on their religion, their birth
place, and a rash of stereo&shy;types about the Irish as lazy, drunkards and
brawlers. They worked hard, earned success and managed to make a place
for themselves and their children in the <span class="caps">US</span>.</blockquote>
<p>She wants to find out what&#8217;s true for the first-generation Irish immigrants
who are living in the Northwest today.
The tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al take is still partially true, especially for the older
generation who arrived in the 1940s or 1950s.
It&#8217;s far less true for many of the more recent immigrants,
such as myself, who were part of the great Irish brain drain,
now greatly slowed by the Celtic&nbsp;Tiger.</p>
<p>About 15 years ago on the soc.culture.celtic newsgroup,
someone asserted that 80% of those born in the 1930s
emigrated from Ireland in the 1950s.
I found that incredible and asked him for some proof.
He pointed me towards <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521377412/?tag=georgvreill-20">Lee&#8217;s Ireland 1912-1985</a>,
where indeed I found that statement.
The 1940s and 1950s were extremely difficult for Ireland,
but losing 80% of your young people is truly horrific.
Some fraction may have returned later, but most were gone&nbsp;forever.</p>
<p>Melissa is still looking for people to complete the survey.
Tell her I sent&nbsp;you.</p>
