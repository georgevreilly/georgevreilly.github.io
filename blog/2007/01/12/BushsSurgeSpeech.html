<p>Keith Olbermann was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16583889/">on fire tonight</a>,
condemning the insanity of escalating a lost war that the
American public so clearly wants no more&nbsp;of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only this president could look out over a vista of 3,008 dead and
22,834 wounded in Iraq, and finally say, “Where mistakes have been
made, the re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty rests with me” — only to follow that by
proposing to repeat the identical mistake &#8230; in&nbsp;Iran.</p>
<p>&#8230;-</p>
<p>And yet — without any au&shy;tho&shy;riza&shy;tion from the public, which spoke so
loudly and clearly to you in November’s elections — without any
con&shy;sul&shy;ta&shy;tion with a Congress (in which key members of your own party,
including Sens. Sam Brownback, Norm Coleman and Chuck Hagel, are
fleeing for higher ground) — without any awareness that you are doing
exactly the opposite of what Baker-Hamilton urged you to do — you seem
to be ready to make an open-ended commitment (on America’s behalf) to
do whatever you want, in&nbsp;Iran.</p>
<p>&#8230;-</p>
<p>The lives of 21,500 more Americans endangered, to give “breathing
space” to a government that just turned the first and perhaps the most
sober act of any democracy — the capital punishment of an ousted
dictator — into a vengeance lynching so barbaric and so lacking in the
solem&shy;ni&shy;ties necessary for credible authority, that it might have
offended the Ku Klux Klan of the 19th&nbsp;century.</p>
<p>&#8230;-</p>
<p>Before Mr. Bush was elected, he said nation-building was wrong for&nbsp;America.</p>
<p>Now he says it is&nbsp;vital.</p>
<p>He said he would never put <span class="caps">U.S.</span> troops under foreign&nbsp;control.</p>
<p>Last night he promised to embed them in Iraqi&nbsp;units.</p>
<p>He told us about&nbsp;<span class="caps">WMD</span>.</p>
<p>Mobile&nbsp;labs.</p>
<p>Secret&nbsp;sources.</p>
<p>Aluminum&nbsp;tubes.</p>
<p>Yellow-cake.</p>
<p>He has told us the war is&nbsp;necessary:</p>
<p>Because Saddam was a material&nbsp;threat.</p>
<p>Because of&nbsp;9/11.</p>
<p>Because of Osama Bin Laden. Al-Qaida. Terrorism in&nbsp;general.</p>
<p>To liberate Iraq. To spread freedom. To spread Democracy. To prevent
terrorism by gas price&nbsp;increases.</p>
<p>Because this was a guy who tried to kill his&nbsp;dad.</p>
<p>Because — 439 words in to the speech last night — he trotted out 9/11&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>In advocating and pros&shy;e&shy;cut&shy;ing this war he passed on a chance to get Abu
Musab&nbsp;Al-Zarqawi.</p>
<p>To get Muqtada Al-Sadr. To get Bin&nbsp;Laden.</p>
<p>He sent in fewer troops than the generals told him to. He ordered the
Iraqi army disbanded and the Iraqi government&nbsp;“de-Baathified.”</p>
<p>He short-changed Iraqi training. He neglected to plan for widespread
looting. He did not anticipate sectarian&nbsp;violence.</p>
<p>He sent in troops without life-saving equipment. He gave jobs to
foreign con&shy;trac&shy;tors, and not Iraqis. He staffed <span class="caps">U.S.</span> positions there,
based on par&shy;ti&shy;san&shy;ship, not&nbsp;pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ism.</p>
<p>He and his government told us: America had prevailed, mission
ac&shy;com&shy;plished, the resistance was in its last&nbsp;throes.</p>
<p>He has insisted more troops were not necessary. He has now insisted
more troops are&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<p>He has insisted it’s up to the generals, and then removed some of the
generals who said more troops would not be&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<p>He has trumpeted the turning&nbsp;points:</p>
<p>The fall of Baghdad, the death of Uday and Qusay, the capture of
Saddam. A pro&shy;vi&shy;sion&shy;al government, a charter, a con&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion, the trial
of Saddam. Elections, purple fingers, another government, the death of&nbsp;Saddam.</p>
<p>He has assured us: We would be greeted as liberators — with&nbsp;flowers;</p>
<p>As they stood up, we would stand down. We would stay the course; we
were never about “stay the&nbsp;course.”</p>
<p>We would never have to go door-to-door in Baghdad. And, last night,
that to gain Iraqis’ trust,  we would go door-to-door in&nbsp;Baghdad.</p>
<p>He told us the enemy was al-Qaida, foreign fighters, terrorists,
Baathists, and now Iran and&nbsp;Syria.</p>
<p>He told us the war would pay for itself. It would cost $1.7 billion.
$100 billion. $400 billion. Half a trillion. Last night’s speech alone
cost another $6&nbsp;billion.</p>
<p>And after all of that, now it is his cred&shy;i&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty versus that of
generals, diplomats, allies, Democrats, Re&shy;pub&shy;li&shy;cans, the Iraq Study
Group, past presidents, voters last November and the majority of the
American&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more to add, tonight: Oceania has always been at war with
East&nbsp;Asia.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush, this is&nbsp;madness.</p>
<p>You have lost the military. You have lost the Congress to the
Democrats. You have lost most of the Iraqis. You have lost many of the
Re&shy;pub&shy;li&shy;cans. You have lost our&nbsp;allies.</p>
<p>You are losing the cred&shy;i&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty, not just of your presidency, but more
im&shy;por&shy;tant&shy;ly of the office&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>And most im&shy;per&shy;a&shy;tive&shy;ly, you are guar&shy;an&shy;tee&shy;ing that more American troops
will be losing their lives, and more families their loved ones. You are
guar&shy;an&shy;tee&shy;ing&nbsp;it!</p>
<p>This becomes your legacy, sir: How many of those you addressed last
night as your “fellow citizens” you just sent to their&nbsp;deaths.</p>
<p>And for what, Mr.&nbsp;Bush?</p>
<p>So the next president has to pull the survivors out of Iraq instead of&nbsp;you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bush sent troops into an Iranian consulate in Iraq last night,
invading the sovereign territory of Iran.
Is he trying to provoke Iran into a war too?
How does he propose to fight it?
Is he trying to bring on the end&nbsp;times?</p>
<p>Feh!</p>
