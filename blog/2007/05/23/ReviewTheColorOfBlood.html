<p>Sequel to <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/01/14/ReviewTheWrongKindOfBlood.html">The Wrong Kind of Blood</a>, in which private eye Ed Loy
returned to his native Dublin after 20 years in Los&nbsp;Angeles.</p>
<p>Loy is asked to find Emily, a teenager from the pres&shy;ti&shy;gious Howard family,
after porno&shy;graph&shy;ic photos of her are sent to her father.
He locates her easily, but not before he finds a body,
the first of several murders that will rip the Howards apart,
unearthing long-buried&nbsp;secrets.</p>
<p>Loy is a hard-boiled private eye, somewhat in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.en.utexas.edu/amlit/amlitprivate/scans/chandlerart.html">Marlowe vein</a>:
&quot;a man of honor, by instinct, by in&shy;evitabil&shy;i&shy;ty, without thought of
it, and certainly without saying it.  &#8230;
He is a common man or he could not go among common people.
He has a sense of character, or he would not know his&nbsp;job.&quot;</p>
<p>He observes the Howards with a horrified fas&shy;ci&shy;na&shy;tion:
&quot;I realized then that I wanted, as much as anything else,
to <em>understand</em> this family in their houses on the tops of hills,
to uncover their secrets, to see the Howards plain.
Once I had admitted that to myself,
I knew that there was no way on earth
I was stepping off this train until the end.&quot;
He thrives on chaos, from a need to make patterns
and establish the con&shy;nec&shy;tions they can&#8217;t&nbsp;see.</p>
<p>Loy throws in ob&shy;ser&shy;va&shy;tions on con&shy;tem&shy;po&shy;rary Irish society
from his outsider&#8217;s per&shy;spec&shy;tive,
skewering the post-colonial mentality wrought by the <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/01/14/TaFuckAllGaeilgeAgam.html">Celtic Tiger</a>,
the hedonistic mind&shy;less&shy;ness of teenage clubbers,
and the man-boys of the south Dublin rugby clubs.
He condemns the failures of previous gen&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tions too,
notably the Catholic Church&#8217;s strange&shy;hold
and their willing enforcers, the&nbsp;doctors.</p>
<p>None of these distract from a fast-paced, well-told story;
they inform it and place it in a context.
Hughes has a light touch with the Hiberno-English idioms,
and non-Irish readers should have no problems
following the&nbsp;dialog.</p>
<p>Minor quibbles: for a man who&#8217;s just come back from two decades
in America, he hardly thinks about it at all.
And did the two <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dublinpeople.com/interact/dublindictionary/e-j.shtml">gurriers</a>, Darren and Wayne,
have to have the name&nbsp;Reilly?</p>
<p>(Per my <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2007/05/22/ReviewPolicy.html">Review Policy</a>, Harper&shy;Collins provided me with a review copy of
the&nbsp;book.)</p>
