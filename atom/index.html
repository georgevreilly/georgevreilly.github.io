&lt;p&gt;I have an ambivalent relation to the notion of patriotism
because all too often those who most loudly proclaim themselves to be patriots
are the worst sort of jingoistic, know-nothing, blowhards—be they Trump supporters, Brexiters, or Irish nationalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, for all the flaws and failures of the American Experiment,
there are still things to celebrate.
America&#39;s optimism and can-do spirit, although much abraded in recent years, is still exemplary.
Millions continue to flock here, drawn to the land of opportunity.
The Founding Fathers created a great and lasting democracy,
albeit with a franchise and a set of rights that had to be widened several times.
The world can&#39;t get enough of America&#39;s technology and movies and clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me close with John Cena&#39;s video, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://youtu.be/0MdK8hBkR3s&#34;&gt;We are America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy 240th birthday, United States of America!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mid-2012 15&amp;quot; MacBook Pro has been getting ever slower.
My last two work laptops came with SSDs, but this older machine has a 768GB hard disk drive.
It was time to get a solid-state drive, which are far more affordable now than four years ago.
Rather than replace the HDD, I bought a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/internal_storage/Data_Doubler&#34;&gt;Data Doubler&lt;/a&gt; kit and a 480GB SSD.
I removed the optical drive and installed the Data Doubler with SSD in that space.
I rarely used the DVD drive, so I won&#39;t miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Doubler kit came with a set of screwdrivers and
a detailed manual that covered multiple MacBook models.
The manual had combined instructions for both the 2011 and 2012 15&amp;quot; MacBook Pros,
which weren&#39;t quite right for the mid-2012 model.
The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Unibody+Mid+2012+Optical+Drive+Replacement/10771&#34;&gt;iFixIt&lt;/a&gt; instructions cleared up my confusion
regarding the camera cable connector.
That aside, it went flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/04/format-an-external-hard-drive-or-usb-flash-drive-for-mac-os-x/&#34;&gt;Disk Utility&lt;/a&gt; to format the new drive as HFS+.
I had previously made a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.macworld.com/article/2981585/operating-systems/how-to-make-a-bootable-os-x-10-11-el-capitan-installer-drive.html&#34;&gt;bootable USB thumbdrive&lt;/a&gt; of OS X 10.11.
I booted from the thumbdrive by holding down &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_key&#34;&gt;Option ⌥&lt;/a&gt; as the laptop turned on.
I installed a clean copy of OS X on the new SSD drive,
leaving the original HDD untouched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still setting up the new installation,
but the laptop does seem much more responsive than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrowland_(film)&#34;&gt;Tomorrowland&lt;/a&gt; is a story of dashed dreams and recovered optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1964, eleven-year-old Frank Walker meets a girl called Athena
who takes him from the World&#39;s Fair into a futuristic city called Tomorrowland.
In the present day, where doom and gloom reign,
a teenager called Casey hasn&#39;t given up hope of a better future.
She is recruited by Athena—somehow no older—to save the world.
Casey finds Frank, who is embittered at having been cast out of paradise decades ago.
They find their way back into the now-desolate Tomorrowland
and destroy the machine that&#39;s casting a pall of despair across our world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds incoherent, that&#39;s because the film is an expensive mess,
and far from Brad Bird&#39;s best work.
Casey and Frank and Athena run around a lot, but it&#39;s hard to care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy%27s_Hall&#34;&gt;Jimmy&#39;s Hall&lt;/a&gt; tells how Jimmy Gralton became the only Irishman ever deported from Ireland.
Gralton returns to rural Ireland from the US in 1932,
after being run out ten years&#39; earlier
during the Irish Civil War for Communist activity.
He revives the dance hall he had built previously,
as it is a much-needed outlet for the young to dance, study, and talk,
and immediately runs afoul of the local powers,
particularly the parish priest.
Tensions escalate, culminating in his deportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Loach is never subtle about his own socialist beliefs.
&lt;em&gt;Jimmy&#39;s Hall&lt;/em&gt; is a polemic about
the struggle between the stifling, small-minded, social conformity of the Irish Catholic Church,
allied with the wealthy and powerful and their enforcers,
against the downtrodden yet defiant ordinary people,
as movies, radio, jazz, the Depression, and fascism transform lives.
We see a good deal of Gralton and of the parish priest,
though they share few scenes,
while we experience little of the other characters.
Still, we learn about a period that&#39;s little known now
and we are moderately entertained.&lt;/p&gt;

        <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/30/ReStructuredTextAnonymousHyperlinks.html" />

        </author>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While researching &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/29/reStructuredTextNestedMarkup.html&#34;&gt;yesterday&#39;s post&lt;/a&gt; about nested markup in ReStructuredText,
I finally learned how to use &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#anonymous-hyperlinks&#34;&gt;anonymous hyperlinks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitherto, I used one of these three forms for hyperlinks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;literal-block&#34;&gt;
1. The central conceit of the fictional `Flashman Papers`_ is that Flashy
2. besieging Breda_ in 1625.
3. my club, `Freely Speaking Toastmasters &amp;lt;http://freelyspeaking.org/&amp;gt;`_.

.. _Flashman Papers:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flashman_Papers
.. _Breda: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Breda
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;`Flashman Papers`_&lt;/tt&gt;, is a &lt;em&gt;named hyperlink reference&lt;/em&gt;,
which refers to an &lt;em&gt;external hyperlink target&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;.. _Flashman Papers: URI&lt;/tt&gt;.
Note that the reference name starts with a backquote, &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;`&lt;/tt&gt;,
and ends with backquote-underscore, &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;`_&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;Breda_&lt;/tt&gt;, is a &lt;em&gt;simple reference name&lt;/em&gt;—the backquotes are optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;`Freely Speaking Toastmasters &lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;http://freelyspeaking.org/&amp;gt;`_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;,
is an &lt;em&gt;embedded URI&lt;/em&gt;.
The syntax is &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;`&lt;/tt&gt;, reference-name, &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt;, URI, &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;`&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With anonymous hyperlinks,
the reference name does not need to be repeated in the hyperlink target.
Instead, the reference name ends with a double-underscore, &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;__&lt;/tt&gt;,
and the target looks like either &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;.. __: URI&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;__ URI&lt;/tt&gt;.
The targets must appear in the order they are referenced.
It&#39;s best if they&#39;re close to the references in the text, for maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;literal-block&#34;&gt;
researching `yesterday&#39;s post`__ about ...,
I learned how to use `anonymous hyperlinks`__.

.. __: /blog/2016/06/29/reStructuredTextNestedMarkup.html
__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#anonymous-hyperlinks
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To handle escaping backquotes inside code literals for this post,
I used the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/roles.html#literal&#34;&gt;literal role&lt;/a&gt; instead of double backquotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;literal-block&#34;&gt;
The first, :literal:`\`Flashman Papers\`_`, is a *named hyperlink reference*
Normally, I use double-backquotes to bracket code: ``a += b &amp;amp; c[i]``.
&lt;/pre&gt;

i.e., in the &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;code&lt;/tt&gt; font.
ReStructuredText doesn&#39;t support nested markup,
but you can &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/a/4836544/6364&#34;&gt;pull it together&lt;/a&gt; with a two-step &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#substitution-references&#34;&gt;substitution reference&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;literal-block&#34;&gt;
Here you have |optparse.OptionParser|_.

.. |optparse.OptionParser| replace:: ``optparse.OptionParser`` documentation
.. _optparse.OptionParser: http://docs.python.org/library/optparse.html
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is tedious as you have to create a pair of directives
for every such link that you wish to style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nested inline markup has been on the todo list for 15 years—it ain&#39;t happening.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many of us are guilty of saying “database” when we mean a database server or a DBMS.
A database is a collection of tables storing related data,
schemas, stored procs, and permissions.
Most database servers are capable of managing many databases simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to create a new PostgreSQL database at Amazon&#39;s RDS last week.
I already had an RDS instance; I needed a new database on that instance.
My Google searches turned up various recipes for creating a new RDS instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following worked for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;SSH to an EC2 instance inside our VPC,
so that I could connect to the RDS instance using &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://postgresguide.com/utilities/psql.html&#34;&gt;psql&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Then run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;literal-block&#34;&gt;
psql --host=SOME-DBMS-HOST --dbname EXISTING_DB \
     --username=YOUR-USERNAME --password \

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Using &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;--password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will prompt you for a password.
If you&#39;ve set up &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.sleeplessbeastie.eu/2014/03/23/how-to-non-interactively-provide-password-for-the-postgresql-interactive-terminal/&#34;&gt;&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;~/.pgpass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can specify &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;--no-password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;The critical part that was hard to figure out is that I had to specify
&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;--dbname&lt;/span&gt; EXISTING_DB&lt;/tt&gt;.
Otherwise, psql kept trying to connect to a database called YOUR-USERNAME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;This should work for any PostgreSQL server, not just one hosted at RDS.&lt;/p&gt;

I also read its inspiration, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner_of_Zenda&#34;&gt;The Prisoner of Zenda&lt;/a&gt;,
Anthony Hope&#39;s classic adventure novel.
Rudolf Rassendyll, a young British aristocrat,
decides to visit Ruritania,
where his distant cousin and doppelgänger, the dissipated Rudolf Elphberg,
is about to be crowned king.
The future king has a half brother, “Black” Michael,
who begrudges him the throne and also covets his fiancée, Princess Flavia.
Michael kidnaps the king and the king&#39;s friends,
in a desperate attempt to preserve political peace,
persuade Rassendyll to impersonate the king.
The imposture is successful and a stalemate is achieved:
Michael cannot reveal that he holds the real king prisoner at his castle in Zenda,
while Rassendyll dare not reveal that he is not the true king.
Rassendyll and Flavia fall in love with each other—she thinks he is a changed man.
Eventually Rassendyll must rescue his cousin from Zenda before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is exciting enough,
but the writing is jejune and would not pass muster today.
&lt;em&gt;Royal Flash&lt;/em&gt; is a better book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having made an enemy of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck&#34;&gt;Otto von Bismarck&lt;/a&gt; a few years earlier,
Flashman now finds himself compelled by Bismarck to impersonate a Danish prince
in a German duchy, taking his place in a marriage to the duchess.
Flashman is a doppelgänger for Carl Gustaf and with his talent for languages,
he&#39;s able to pull it off.
At first he believes that Carl Gustaf is recuperating from an embarrassing case of the pox,
and he settles into enjoying his role.
Then he learns that Bismarck is trying to trigger the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleswig-Holstein_Question&#34;&gt;Schleswig-Holstein Question&lt;/a&gt;
and is holding the prince a prisoner.
Flashy, poltroon that he is, would rather flee,
but Danish partisans compel him to rescue the prince.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this all sounds like &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/27/ReviewThePrisonerOfZenda.html&#34;&gt;The Prisoner of Zenda&lt;/a&gt;,
that&#39;s because Flashman claims that he told the story to the author of that book.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flash&#34;&gt;Royal Flash&lt;/a&gt; is the sequel to &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/22/ReviewFlashman.html&#34;&gt;Flashman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When histories of 21st-century Britain are written,
the Brexit referendum will undoubtedbly be prominent.
A small majority of Britons voted to do the unthinkable,
to secede from the European Union.
Xenophobes and racists in coalition with the marginalized and disaffected
have delivered a big fuck you to London and to Brussels.
Some had cast a protest vote,
not believing that Leave would actually win.
Remorse immediately set in,
as the pound has dropped to a thirty-year low,
billions in EU funding is set to dry up,
and prime minister Cameron has resigned.
Scotland and Northern Ireland both voted Remain
and now both are making noises about their own independence from the United Kingdom.
Even the Leave side seems not to have expected victory
and they are floundering and backtracking on the more preposterous of their promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a staunch European, like most Irish citizens,
I&#39;m appalled at this outcome.
There are problems with the EU to be sure,
but I doubt this pyrrhic victory will be to most Leave voters&#39; liking in a few years.
The putative savings will not trickle down to the unemployed in Sunderland and Cornwall.
Instead, they can look forward to further weakening of worker protections
and the social safety net,
as Tories are unshackled from European law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This victory for unreason and xenophobia
should make everyone nervous about the US presidential election.
Trump is harnessing the same rage.
Even if he loses, the dangerous passions that he has stoked will threaten us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the many, many reactions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I watched &lt;em&gt;Independence Day 2&lt;/em&gt;,
I disliked it more and more,
to the point where I was seething with anger
at the stupidity of the plot and the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original 1996 &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(1996_film)&#34;&gt;Independence Day&lt;/a&gt; was at least a watchable B-movie.
The sequel is leaden and plodding and makes no sense.
The characters are perfunctory and uninteresting,
while the comic reliefs are teeth-grindingly irritating.
You might assume that the young pilot who is the son of Will Smith&#39;s character
would be the lead in this film,
but he&#39;s sidelined here by Liam Hemsworth as the Top Gun jock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My anger is primarily directed at the repeated insults the plot offered to my intelligence.
Friendly alien materializes over the moon and gets shot down immediately;
doesn&#39;t think to call ahead or to send in an emissary.
Captain Hiller flees from the moon to the Earth and goes off alone to rescue his mother—an inexcusable dereliction of duty when the Earth has just been attacked.
Old man Julius&#39;s boat somehow floats 2,000 miles on a tidal wave
from the Atlantic to Nevada—yet he&#39;s unscathed.
Pilots are sent in to bomb the mothership
and are told that HQ will wait
until they&#39;re clear before setting off the fusion bombs—it&#39;s a suicide mission; the bombs would be triggered as soon as they reach the target.
People waste time making speeches when seconds count.
The entire world is under attack,
yet we spent more time on the moon than we do anywhere else outside the US,
apart from an early scene in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On and on and on, the characters act stupidly and unbelievably
in this threadbare excuse for a plot.
Roland Emmerich, I want my money back!&lt;/p&gt;

        </author>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I&#39;ve been spoilt,
but most of the speakers at the technical meetups and conferences that I go to
have something to say and say it well.
I&#39;ve also been to hundreds of Toastmasters meetings
and I&#39;ve heard many speakers at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to a tech meetup tonight and I sat through two bad hour-long presentations.
The first speaker should have eliminated the first 20 minutes of his talk,
a self-indulgent ramble about various other projects that he had attempted,
which shed no light on his main topic.
He could easily have eliminated another 15 minutes from the rest of his talk
and it would have been the better for it.
Many people, including myself, were obviously bored
and paid more attention to their phones than the speaker.
The speaker had some mildly interesting points to share,
but I can&#39;t claim that I learned much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second talk likewise was too long.
I left before the end, after nearly half the audience had gone.
This speaker was more nervous than the first,
and he was also unfocused and disorganized.
His demos were clumsy and imparted little to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tips for would-be technical speakers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Have something to say.
Know what your point is.
What do you want us to take away from your speech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Rehearse, dammit.
Don&#39;t just write some slides.
Speaking the words aloud will focus your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Rehearse in front of someone who will give you constructive feedback
about your content and delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Record your rehearsal and watch the video.
Your phone has a video camera, so no excuses.
You will learn a lot from watching yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class=&#34;first docutils&#34;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Rehearse your demos even more than your speech.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ul class=&#34;first last simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you demoing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are you demoing this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should we care?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Are your slides &lt;em&gt;legible&lt;/em&gt; when you&#39;re standing at least 10 feet away from your monitor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Get to the room early and debug the inevitable problems with projectors and audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;first&#34;&gt;Advice often given to writers is to
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://writeroutine.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-to-kill-your-darlings.html&#34;&gt;kill your darlings&lt;/a&gt;—remove the parts of your manuscript that you may love
but which do not advance the plot.
Likewise, remove extraneous slides and bullet points from your presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brigadier-General Sir Harry Flashman,
celebrated Victorian soldier,
winner of the Victoria Cross,
survivor of the charge of the Light Brigade,
the battle of Little Big Horn,
and the raid on Harper&#39;s Ferry,
reveals himself in this frank memoir published long after his death
to be “a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward—and, oh yes, a toady.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central conceit of the fictional &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flashman_Papers&#34;&gt;Flashman Papers&lt;/a&gt;
is that Flashy, writing frankly in his old age about his remarkable set of adventures,
is perfectly willing to put himself in a bad light,
because he was an unabashed rogue and a poltroon who was never caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first novel in the series and it reveals how Flashman first made his name.
Later novels were not published in chronological order.
Fraser, having set down the mileposts of Flashman&#39;s life in the first book,
filled them in as the mood took him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young Flashman is expelled from Rugby School for beastly drunkenness,
an episode taken from &lt;em&gt;Tom Brown&#39;s School Days&lt;/em&gt;.
His father buys him a commission in a regiment of dragoons,
but he disgraces himself and is sent to India and thence to Afghanistan,
where he gets caught up in the First Anglo-Afghan War.
He is one of the few survivors of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1842_retreat_from_Kabul&#34;&gt;1842 retreat from Kabul&lt;/a&gt;,
the debacle also known as Elphinstone&#39;s Massacre.
He is mistakenly believed to have performed heroically—those who knew otherwise having all been killed—and so becomes a major celebrity upon his return to England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraser is a master storyteller and Flashman is a marvelous character,
entertaining yet rotten, cruel yet compelling, boorish yet endearing.
It&#39;s many years since I first this book and it&#39;s still enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I complained &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/18/17/DeployingDockerContainersOnAWSPart2.html&#34;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; about my difficulties in deploying Docker containers on AWS.
I have since succeeded in getting my app to deploy on ElasticBeanstalk,
though I have not quite ironed out all the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found several problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class=&#34;simple&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to revert from a Multi-Container Docker environment
to a Single-Container Docker environment
because ECS wasn&#39;t starting in the multi-container environment.
That meant I had to revert to a v1 &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;Dockerrun.aws.json&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to ensure that the Instance Profile had the
AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly policy attached,
so that I could pull from the EC2 Container Repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I complained &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/05/24/DeployingADockerContainerOnAWS.html&#34;&gt;a few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; about how hard it was to deploy Docker containers on AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week has been nothing but container-related frustration.
We have two apps running in Kubernetes clusters on top of AWS.
This is not a well-supported scenario and we have a fragile script
that spends a lot of time sitting in polling loops,
waiting for various things to happen like DNS updates taking effect,
the new cluster being available, and so on.
One of the apps has decided to stop deploying.
I do not know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been trying to get a new app deployed on ECS, the EC2 Container Service.
The way to deploy an updated app is to take an existing Task Definition,
update the tag on the image name, and create a new revision.
I have not figured out the right incantation to get the cluster service
to start running the new task consistently,
much less how to do this without any downtime.
It&#39;s insanely difficult to bring up a new cluster,
or, more specifically, to configure an EC2 instance for the new cluster.
There&#39;s a huge list of non-obvious pieces that need to be configured.
I discovered that you could append &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;#/firstRun&lt;/tt&gt; to the URL
to get the first-run wizard to reappear.
That causes no less than 15 pieces of AWS infrastructure to start up,
which is significantly more than you get when you create an ECS cluster the other way.
However, the ELB Load Balancer is not configured correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried going back to ElasticBeanstalk,
since we&#39;ve successfully deployed a Docker container on EB for the last two years.
I realized that the way to bootstrap a new environment is to upload &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;Dockerrun.aws.json&lt;/tt&gt;.
However, I have yet to get the new environment to start up correctly.
I SSHed into the EC2 instance and found that the Docker daemon wasn&#39;t running
and refuses to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/06/17/18/DeployingDockerContainersOnAWSPart3.html&#34;&gt;fixed some problems with ElasticBeanstalk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very, very unhappy with AWS this week.&lt;/p&gt;

He goes on the run,

That was tonight.
Mostly we worked out seating and other logistics.
We are intercutting two different chapters,
with the readers playing different roles in each chapter,
so it&#39;s a small but satisfying accomplishment
to have a seating arrangement that works for both chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote this last night on Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even 25 years after coming out as bisexual,
I still censor myself and still check myself about coming out yet again.
Even though Seattle is about as safe as it gets
and most people here are queer-friendly, it&#39;s reflexive.
And even in Seattle, queer bashings happen.
We came very close to an even bigger tragedy in a gay nightclub in Seattle
on New Year&#39;s Eve 2013,
when an arsonist lit a fire in Neighbours while 750 people were present.
The fire was promptly detected and put out,
no-one was injured, and the perpetrator is in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became aware of my sexuality in a very different time and place—Ireland, about 1980—when it very much was not alright to be out.
I don&#39;t think those scars will ever completely heal.
I know that many of my friends here have much deeper scars than I,
thanks to beatings, harassment, disownment, violent rejection,
lost jobs, lovers and friends lost to AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Darke posted &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/alexdarke/posts/10157060081000422&#34;&gt;Monday, June 13th&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, a friend remarked:
&amp;quot;I don&#39;t understand.
The way you are reacting, it&#39;s almost like you knew someone in the club.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the thing you need to understand
about every LGBT person in your family, your work, and your circle of friends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve spent most of our lives being aware that we are at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hear interviewers talking to LGBT folks and they say
&amp;quot;It could have been here.
It could have been me,&amp;quot;
they aren&#39;t exaggerating.
I don&#39;t care how long you&#39;ve been out,
how far down your road to self acceptance and love you&#39;ve traveled,
we are always aware that we are at some level of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m about as &amp;quot;don&#39;t give a shit what ANYONE thinks&amp;quot;
as anyone you&#39;ll ever meet...
and when I reach to hold Matt&#39;s hand in the car?
I still do the mental calculation of
&amp;quot;ok, that car is just slightly behind us so they can&#39;t see,
but that truck to my left can see right inside the car&amp;quot;.
If I kiss Matt in public, like he leaned in for on the bike trail the other day,
I&#39;m never fully in the moment.
I&#39;m always parsing who is around us and paying attention to us.
There&#39;s a tension that comes with that...
a literal tensing of the muscles as you brace for potential danger.
For a lot of us, it&#39;s become such an automatic reaction
that we don&#39;t even think about it directly any more.
We just do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then... over the last few years, it started to fade a little.
It started to feel like maybe things were getting better.
A string of Supreme Court decisions.
Public opinion shifting to the side of LGBT rights.
Life was getting better.
You could breathe a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened with this event is pretty dramatically demonstrated
by how Matt and I are reacting to it.
Matt came out fairly late, during the golden glow of the changing tide.
He&#39;s never dealt with something like this.
It&#39;s literally turned him inside out emotionally
because all that stuff he read about that was just &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; became very much &amp;quot;NOW&amp;quot;.
For me, I&#39;ve had some time to adjust to the idea that people hate us enough to kill us.
Matthew Shephard was my first real lesson in that.
So this weekend was a sudden slap in the face,
a reminder that I should never have let my guard down,
should never have gotten complacent...
because it could have been US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every LGBT person you know knows what I&#39;m talking about.
Those tiny little mental calculations we do over the course of our life add up...
and we just got hit with a stark reminder that those simmering concerns, those fears...
they probably won&#39;t ever go away.
We&#39;ll never be free of them.
Additionally, now we just got a lesson that expressing our love
could result in the deaths of &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt; completely unrelated to us.
It&#39;s easy to take risks when it&#39;s just you and you&#39;ve made that choice.
Now there&#39;s this subtext that you could set off someone
who kills other people who weren&#39;t even involved.
And that&#39;s just a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s why I&#39;m personally a bit off balance
even though (or because, depending on how you look at it)
I live in Texas and was not personally effected by this tragedy.
Don&#39;t get me wrong: nothing will change.
I will still hold my husband&#39;s hand in public.
I will still kiss him in public.
We&#39;ll still go out and attend functions and hold our heads high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we will be doing those mental calculations for the rest of our lives.
Those little PDAs you take for granted with your spouse.
They come with huge baggage for us.
Every single one is an act of defiance, with all that entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So do me a favor. Reach out to that LGBT person in your life.
Friend, co-worker, or family.
Just let them know you are thinking of them and you love them.
That will mean the world to them right now. I promise you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent the last 90 minutes reading Facebook,
and my feed has been absolutely overwhelmed with Orlando-related posts,
be they grieving, discussing homophobia, calling for gun control,
or reacting to reactions.
I&#39;ve never seen such a skewed set of posts.
Some of it is surely Facebook catering to what it knows are my interests,
but it seems like the vast majority of my friends
and the pages that I follow can talk of nothing else.
Even Trump/Clinton/Sanders articles, except as they pertain to this,
have temporarily disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have seen nothing useful from Republican politicians
regarding gun control or homophobia.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I woke up this morning to news of another American massacre:
a lone gunman had murdered 50 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando,
and injured another 53 people.
It was the worst mass shooting in US history and also the worst hate crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put it out of my head for the afternoon while I attended an old friend&#39;s wedding,
but it&#39;s been at the forefront of my mind ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in America could we put up with massacre after massacre,
yet not find the political will to do anything meaningful about gun violence.
Craven politicians in thrall to the NRA mouth platitudes,
but will not make any changes.
We banned box cutters and bottles of liquid on planes after single incidents,
yet somehow we cannot do anything to reduce the number of guns
or to restrict the ease with which they can be bought,
no matter how many people are shot each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same politicians who refuse to do anything about guns
are also the ones who&#39;ve been whipping up fear about the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt;:
building a wall to keep Mexicans out,
banning transsexuals from bathrooms,
screaming to ban Muslims,
whipping up racial animus against black people.
The drumbeat of hatred and fear grows ever louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to a vigil tonight at Cal Anderson Park on Capitol Hill,
which gave me some hope that there are people of good will out there.
We need more people to say &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;, loudly and implacably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simple_Art_of_Murder&#34;&gt;The Simple Art of Murder&lt;/a&gt; comprises the essay of the same name
and four early non–Philip Marlowe stories (in some editions, there are eight stories).
The essay is justifiably famous and worth reading;
the stories are of middling quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All are available online:
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.en.utexas.edu/amlit/amlitprivate/scans/chandlerart.html&#34;&gt;The Simple Art of Murder Essay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/chandler__spanish_blood__en.htm&#34;&gt;Spanish Blood&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/chandler__ill_be_waiting__en.htm&#34;&gt;I&#39;ll be Waiting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/chandler__the_king_in_yellow__en.htm&#34;&gt;The King in Yellow&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/chandler__pearls_are_a_nuisance__en.htm&#34;&gt;Pearls are a Nuisance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the essay, Chandler takes aim at the sterile confections of deduction
that comprised most detective fiction written in the 1920s and 1930s,
which “do not really come off intellectually as problems,
and they do not come off artistically as fiction.”
He contrasts that with the realistic style of Dashiell Hammett,
who “gave murder back to the kind of people that commit it for reasons,
not just to provide a corpse;
and with the means at hand,
not with hand-wrought duelling pistols, curare, and tropical fish.”
He concludes:
“In everything that can be called art there is a quality of redemption.
It may be pure tragedy, if it is high tragedy, and it may be pity and irony,
and it may be the raucous laughter of the strong man.
But down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean,
who is neither tarnished nor afraid.
The detective in this kind of story must be such a man ...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pearls are a Nuisance&lt;/em&gt; is a story of the kind that Chandler complained about.
More precisely, it&#39;s a parody of such stories,
with a well-spoken gentleman teaming up with a hard-drinking ruffian
to retrieve the purloined pearls of Mrs Penruddock.
It&#39;s the weakest story in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other three stories are classic Chandler,
tales of moral ambiguity that are whydunnits, not whodunnits.
In &lt;em&gt;Spanish Blood&lt;/em&gt;, a hardboiled cop investigates the political murder of an old friend.
&lt;em&gt;I&#39;ll be Waiting&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s sad house detective tries and fails to save a man.
&lt;em&gt;The King in Yellow&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s private eye
discovers a mess of frameups and revenge.&lt;/p&gt;

an innovative system that uses just three English words to address
any 3m×3m square on the planet.
These words are drawn from a 40,000-word vocabulary.
A 3m×3m square is precise enough to identify a particular doorway in a large building
or a towel on a crowded beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent much of my childhood living at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://w3w.co/uses.pills.crunch&#34;&gt;uses.pills.crunch&lt;/a&gt; (Dublin).
I spent ten years working at &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://w3w.co/navy.clear.poems&#34;&gt;navy.clear.poems&lt;/a&gt; (Microsoft&#39;s Redmond campus).
If I pinpointed the buildings that I worked in,
they would each have completely different w3w addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me a little of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2016/01/07/DicewareAndLastpass.html&#34;&gt;Diceware&lt;/a&gt; which strings together several words
to form an easy-to-remember but hard-to-crack password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said “English words” above but I lied.
W3w is actually available in multiple languages,
though many of them use a 25,000-word vocabulary,
which omits the seas.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee for the 2016 Presidential race.
Although Sanders has not yet ended his campaign, he can&#39;t win.
I voted for Sanders in the Washington state caucus
and I still have his yard sign sitting in my front yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike some diehard Sanders&#39; supporters,
I have absolutely no qualms getting behind Clinton.
She&#39;s one of the most qualified candidates ever to run.
If elected, she will be on the right side of many of the issues I care about
and she will make good appointments to the Supreme Court.
She&#39;s competent and capable and gets things done.
Clinton has survived more scrutiny and more attacks than just about anyone else.
She&#39;s not perfect:
for example, she&#39;s closer to Wall Street than I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I compare her to Donald Trump,
to his utter unfitness for office,
to his dangerous bellicosity,
to the appointments he&#39;d make,
to his denial of climate change,
it&#39;s a very, very easy decision for me to support Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillary for President!&lt;/p&gt;

that I was getting ready for this year&#39;s reading of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;.
Our &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/Joyce/Bloomsday/2016.html&#34;&gt;2016 Reading&lt;/a&gt; is a week and a half away, on Sunday June 19th.
We&#39;ll be reading Chapters 3 (“Proteus”) and 6 (“Hades”)
of James Joyce&#39;s masterpiece at the Seattle Central Library.
We had our first full readthrough at tonight&#39;s rehearsal,
one hour fifty five minutes.
Next week, our dress rehearsal.&lt;/p&gt;
