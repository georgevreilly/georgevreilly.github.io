&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 1592 and Elizabeth I has ruled England for nearly 35 years.
The Virgin Queen has never named her heir,
creating both uncertainty and opportunity.
John Shakespeare used to be an &amp;quot;intelligencer&amp;quot; for the late Sir Francis Walsingham,
Elizabeth&#39;s spymaster.
With reluctance, Shakespeare is drawn back into that life when the Earl of Essex insists
upon commisioning him to find a woman who should be dead—a survivor of the lost Roanoke settlement has been sighted in London.
Essex wants her as does his mysterious ally, a dangerous Irishman called McGunn.
Walsingham&#39;s successor, Sir Robert Cecil, also wants Shakespeare to take the commission,
as he suspects Essex of treason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clements does an excellent job of recreating Elizabethan England:
the sights and smells; the concerns of the day, like plague and popery;
the religious schisms that have split families and nations;
the intrigues and brutality and treachery.
Shakespeare is a decent, capable man in a dangerous position
who knows too much yet not enough.
He manages to keep his head on his shoulders
and also shields his younger brother—an up-and-coming poet—from his own deadly foolishness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eighth and penultimate book in the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temeraire_(series)&#34;&gt;Temeraire series&lt;/a&gt;,
which began with &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2010/07/31/ReviewHisMajestysDragon.html&#34;&gt;His Majesty&#39;s Dragon&lt;/a&gt;.
It&#39;s a delightful take on the Napoleonic wars with intelligent dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book opens with William Laurence awaking shipwrecked and amnesiac
on the shores of Japan, where European foreigners are strictly forbidden.
His dragon Temeraire frantically seeks him, while the rest of the crew think him dead.
After being reunited in Nagasaki, they travel on to the Chinese court in Peking
and enlist the help of the emperor&#39;s dragons in fighting Napoleon,
who has marched into Russia with his own dragons and troops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the book, although I didn&#39;t care for the plot device of amnesia.
Temeraire, who is still a very young dragon and not very wise for all of his intelligence,
matures a little as he begins to realize consequences of his impetuosity.
The series has gone on a little too long and I&#39;m glad that the next book
is supposed to bring everything to a close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has split apart by 2047,
into a dozen competing states desperate for the life-giving monsoon rains.
New castes have appeared, as have the new gender of nutes.
Aeais (artificial intelligences) abound
but are strictly proscribed from attaining full sentience.
And an asteroid with seven-billion-year-old images of now-living people has been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald draws together nine people from different walks of life,
weaving their tales into one tapestry.
India, ancient yet up-to-the-minute, is the vibrant backdrop for this explosion of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Reading period: 24–24 February, 2015&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, we visited our friends Louise and Melissa in South Florida,
and we drove down &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Highway&#34;&gt;Highway 1&lt;/a&gt;
through the Florida Keys to Key West—the southernmost city in the United States.
Recently, they sent me a copy of this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Flagler&#34;&gt;Henry Flagler&lt;/a&gt;
was well-known in his own time as one of the Robber Barons of the Golden Age.
He founded Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller and became fabulously wealthy.
In his later years, he turned to building; specifically, building Florida.
Starting in St. Augustine in northern Florida,
he pushed his way south, building destination hotels and the railways to bring moneyed visitors.
He put Palm Beach and Miami on the map and became known as the Builder of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1905, he decided that his Florida East Coast Railway
should extend all the way down to Key West.
At that point, Key West had long been one of the largest cities in all of Florida,
and a boom was anticipated, as it was the closest deep-water port in the U.S.
to the Panama Canal, which was then being built.
The Key West Extension was an enormous engineering challenge:
first to hack through the swamps of South Florida,
then to build a railway line through more than 100 miles of the narrow Keys archipelago.
At one point, they built a seven-mile bridge between two of the islands.
Three hurricanes did major damage, killing over a hundred of the workers.
Nevertheless, the railway was opened in 1912, a year before Flagler&#39;s death.
It ran for 23 years until it was destroyed by the
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1935_Labor_Day_hurricane&#34;&gt;Labor Day Hurricane of 1935&lt;/a&gt;,
the strongest hurricane ever to hit the United States.
Later, Highway 1 was constructed along much of the railway&#39;s right-of-way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed Standiford&#39;s book, which told me a history I knew almost nothing of.
He opens on Labor Day Saturday with Ernest Hemingway in Key West,
builds up some tension about the approaching hurricane,
and then goes back to the beginning,
taking us chronologically through Flagler&#39;s life and the construction of the railway,
before finally reveling in the mighty destruction.
Standiford is more concerned with telling a good story than being a professional historian
and he keeps the details light, eschewing footnotes and endnotes,
but providing a selected bibliography.&lt;/p&gt;

        </author>
        <content type="html">&lt;img alt=&#34;George Clery&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/content/binary/GeorgeCleryPipe.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the fiftieth anniversary of the death of my maternal grandfather,
George Victor Clery, on 3rd March 1965.
It did not come as a shock to the family.
His health was often poor and he had been ill for some time.
He was born a month premature on 30th March 1900
and his mother was told she would never rear him.
Nevertheless, he grew up to become an avid golfer and tennis player,
to marry and father five children,
and to live all the way to a brief retirement,
though not quite long enough to see any of his grandchildren.
Both I and my cousin Siobhán were born in the six weeks after his death.
We must have been a welcome distraction for his grieving widow and children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;A &#34;stout&#34; fellow: G.V. Clery, Santry 1934&#34; class=&#34;right-float&#34; src=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/content/binary/GeorgeCleryGolfing.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George joined the family trade of retail banking
and spent his entire career at the Munster &amp;amp; Leinster bank.
Once he became a bank manager, he got to live &amp;quot;above the shop&amp;quot;, in the bankhouse.
My mother spent her entire childhood in two Dublin bankhouses,
many years in the working-class suburb of Inchicore,
followed by a few years in middle-class Rathgar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George had an older brother, Dick, who was always something of a prig.
One day when they were both children,
Dick snapped at George, &amp;quot;Don&#39;t contradict me!&amp;quot;,
to which George replied, &amp;quot;Don&#39;t contrageorge me!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George met Ethna MacDonagh when she was visiting cousins in Ireland.
She had grown up in London, born there of Irish parents.
They had a quick courtship and a quiet wedding in 1936, as one of her sisters had just died.
Four children followed promptly, Joan, Dick, Ethna (my mother), and Georgina,
with Gabriel born in 1949.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;The Clery family, c. 1957. Rear: Ethna Jr, Joan, Dick, Georgina. Front: George, Gabriel, Ethna Sr.&#34; class=&#34;left-float&#34; src=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/content/binary/Clerys1957.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px;&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His word was law in his household, but my mother adored him.
He was very sociable:
he&#39;d invite clients to lunch in the bankhouse at the drop of a hat
and my grandmother would have to figure out to feed them.
He&#39;d stay up late with his cronies, playing poker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own parents courted for more than six years,
saving to buy a house,
and George and Ethna Sr became friendly with Paddy and Kathleen Reilly.
One day, George was ill in bed with a bad case of diarrhoea
and Paddy arrives with a present.
George unwraps it and finds an enormous cork to stop the flow, which he found quite amusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents married on George&#39;s 64th birthday, 30th March 1964.
Alas, he did not live to celebrate their first wedding anniversary.
My mother was nine months pregnant with me when he died.
Despite the stress, I was born two weeks late, on 15th March.
I was to have been named Vincent, after my father;
instead I was christened George Vincent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to know my other three grandparents well, as they all lived until I was an adult,
but I regret that I had never had a chance to meet George Victor Clery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://nose.readthedocs.org/&#34;&gt;Nose&lt;/a&gt; to run unit tests.
I noticed that we had some tests that weren&#39;t being run,
and it took me some time to work out why.
Eventually, I found this &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.hyperink.com/blog/?p=22&#34;&gt;checklist&lt;/a&gt;,
which told me to &amp;quot;make sure the files in your tests directory are not executable&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;chmod &lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;-x&lt;/span&gt; *.py&lt;/tt&gt; later and &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;nosetests project/tests&lt;/tt&gt; suddenly found all the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I know what to look for, I found this in the Nose docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the default behavior of nose
is to not include tests from files which are executable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;--exe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;: Look for tests in python modules that are executable.
Normal behavior is to exclude executable modules, since they may not be import-safe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Norse raiders arrive in the English village,
Raven, the young outsider who was found two years before with no memory,
realizes that he speaks their language.
He is drawn to them and he joins them in their quest for glory, plunder, and battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a slow start, the plot moves along with enough fighting to hold one&#39;s interest.
Aside from Raven, the characters are poorly drawn,
with little to distinguish or motivate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patterson Wells lives dangerously, clearing fallen trees in hurricane season.
Since the death of his young son a few years ago, he&#39;s been lost in a self-destructive fog.
His life becomes entangled with that of his neighbor&#39;s grown son, Junior,
another lost soul.
Wells and Junior bond after a fashion,
as their lives spiral further out of control,
with drug deals gone bad, drunken sprees, and murders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinating in a grim can&#39;t-look-away-from-the-trainwreck fashion.
Whitmer writes lyrically about broken lives and disposable people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, the Greatcoats were the lawgivers of Tristia.
And then the good king was deposed by the dukes and the Greatcoats were broken up.
Now despised, only a few are left, taking work as caravan guards and sellswords.
Falcio, the former First Cantor, finally starts to care again,
as he is sucked into the dukes&#39; intrigues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Traitor&#39;s Blade&lt;/em&gt; starts out light-hearted and joky,
growing darker and more passionate
as Falcio opens himself up and rediscovers his honor.
De Castell is a fine storyteller and the action moves quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

and the Edinburgh police are looking for her.
In time, they find her body.
A small wooden coffin is found near her home,
and DI John Rebus links that to some cold cases,
while DC Siobhan Clarke tracks down the mysterious Quizmaster on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another enjoyable and competent police procedural from Ian Rankin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willie Dunne is the innocent 18-year-old son of a senior Dublin policeman,
who promptly joins the Royal Dublin Fusiliers when the First World War breaks out,
along with thousands of other Irishmen.
Their early optimism that the war will be over by Christmas 1914 is soon crushed
as both sides get bogged down in the trench warfare of the Western Front.
Four long, brutal years of stalemate in the killing fields of Flanders follow,
and much of Willie&#39;s regiment die during those years.
We see the terror and the horror through Willie&#39;s eyes,
the waste of human life, the carnage, and the disillusionment of the Irish soldiers.
It&#39;s a harrowing book and also a beautiful elegy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a 2TB external hard disk today.
It&#39;s about the size of a deck of cards, but thinner,
and it cost me $95.
Disk Utility says it has 2,000,397,884,928 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, I got to see more than three terabytes of disks in one system.
At the time, a server with a 25GB disk was considered high capacity.
The 3TB system occupied considerably more volume than a pack of cards.
I don&#39;t know what it cost
but clearly it was tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, I was a developer on the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services&#34;&gt;IIS&lt;/a&gt; team at Microsoft.
I was the lead performance engineer for Microsoft&#39;s web server product.
The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraserver.com&#34;&gt;TerraServer&lt;/a&gt; was a project born in Microsoft Research
intended to demonstrate that SQL Server could scale up to terabyte-sized workloads.
It stored aerial, satellite, and topographic images of the Earth
in a SQL database available via the Internet,
and it was the world’s largest online atlas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They launched the TerraServer on the Internet.
And the Internet liked the TerraServer.
And the TerraServer fell over.
So I got called in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was June and I was wearing shorts and Birkenstock sandals with no socks.
The TerraServer was housed in one of Microsoft&#39;s data centers
and there was cold air blowing up through the floor,
and quite soon I was wishing that I had worn socks that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TerraServer was the biggest microcomputer-based system I had ever seen.
Quoting the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/68574/msr_tr_99_29_terraserver.pdf&#34;&gt;TerraServer Tech Report&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web site has eight Windows NT servers — 6 web servers and 2 database servers.
The USGS aerial imagery is maintained on a Compaq AlphaServer™ 8400
containing 8 440 Mhz Alpha processors and 10 GB of RAM.
The processor is attached to 7 StorageWorks™
Enterprise Storage Array 10000 (ESA-10000) cabinets.
The disk arrays are based on UltraSCSI technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each ESA-10000 contains 48 9 GB disk drives and
2 HSZ70 dual-redundant RAID-5 controllers.
4 sets of 11 disks each are configured into
a single RAID-5 stripe-set
and managed as a single logical disk by the HSZ70 controller.
2 drives per cabinet are available as hot spares.
Should a disk fail, the HSZ70 controllers automatically
swap a spare drive into a RAID set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows NT Server sees each large (85 GB each) disk
created by the RAID controllers of each of the seven disk cabinets.
It stripes these into 4 large (595 GB) volumes
which are then each formatted and managed
by the Windows NT file system (NTFS).
Each 595 GB volume contains about thirty 20GB files.
SQL Server stores its databases in these large files.
We chose this 20GB file size since it fits conveniently
on one DLT magnetic tape cartridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connected to the AlphaServer 8400 is a StorageTek 9710 automated tape robot.
The tape robot contains 10 Quantum DLT7000 tape drives.
Legato Networker backup software can backup
the entire 1.5 TB TerraServer SQL database to the StorageTek tape robot
in 7 hours and 15 minutes — or 17 GB/hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database back-end: 1 8-way 440Mhz Compaq AlphaServer 8400,
10GB ram, 3.2 TB raid5 324 9GB Ultra SCSI disks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, 7 &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://manx.classiccmp.org/collections/mds-199909/cd3/storage/smcppuga.pdf&#34;&gt;cabinets&lt;/a&gt; (pictured above)
measuring 2&#39; wide by 3&#39; deep and 5&#39; tall, housing 324 9GB disks.
And another cabinet for the servers.
And one for the tape robot.
The whole thing must have been about 20 feet wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison, the 15&amp;quot; mid-2012 MacBook Pro laptop that I&#39;m writing this on
has 16GB RAM, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 (4 hyperthreaded cores),
750GB internal disk (HDD), and the aforementioned 2TB external disk.
I&#39;ve been backing up to that external disk
and I&#39;ve been hitting 90MB/s transfer rates.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law&#34;&gt;Moore&#39;s Law&lt;/a&gt; marches on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I can&#39;t recall what I actually did to help them out,
but between me and other people,
they got it working satisfactorily within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every so often, one of our &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo&#34;&gt;Bamboo&lt;/a&gt; builds would break thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;literal-block&#34;&gt;
pkg_resources.ExtractionError: Can&#39;t extract file(s) to egg cache

The following error occurred while trying to extract file(s) to the Python egg
cache:

  [Errno 17] File exists: &#39;/home/bamboo/.python-eggs&#39;

The Python egg cache directory is currently set to:

  /home/bamboo/.python-eggs

Perhaps your account does not have write access to this directory?  You can
change the cache directory by setting the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment
variable to point to an accessible directory.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This occurred while trying to make use of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://pycrypto.org&#34;&gt;PyCrypto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a little &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2192323/what-is-the-python-egg-cache-python-egg-cache&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, I decided that instead of installing PyCrypto
as a zipped egg (as it does by default) into the build&#39;s virtual environment,
to instead force it to unzip itself: &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;easy_install &lt;span class=&#34;pre&#34;&gt;--always-unzip&lt;/span&gt; pycrypto&lt;/tt&gt;.
This seems to have fixed the problem,
as &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/pkg_resources.html&#34;&gt;pkg_resources&lt;/a&gt; no longer needs to unpack anything.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://pillow.readthedocs.org/&#34;&gt;Pillow&lt;/a&gt; was also in the Egg Cache and probably needs similar treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I posted a link to the new &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2015/01/leatherman-tread/&#34;&gt;Leatherman Tread Bracelet&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook
the other day, I mentioned that I had recently forfeited a little Swiss Army knife
that I&#39;d owned for 30 years at airport security.
The Tread is a bracelet where each link has one or more mini-tools.
The bracelet itself is about $150–$200, depending upon the exact tools.
With a watch, it&#39;s about $600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I can see the appeal, I have no intention of buying one.
Jan mentioned in the comments that he carries a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001EFSTI/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;Utili-Key 6-in-1 Multi-Tool&lt;/a&gt;
on his key ring, and he&#39;s never had any problems with it at TSA checkpoints.
Since it was only $6.21 at Amazon, I bought one.
And I spent $11.25 on the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AY2WLU/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;Micro-Max 19-in-1 Multi-Function Pocket Tool&lt;/a&gt;
while I was at it.
And I bought some books.
And an &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://aeropressmetalfilters.com/&#34;&gt;Aeropress Metal Filter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Utili-Key weighs only half an ounce and is just slightly longer than most keys.
It immediately found a place on my primary key ring,
along with the house keys,
the barcode key for the gym,
the barrel key for the laptop cable lock,
and the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.prontocycleshare.com/how-it-works&#34;&gt;Pronto Cycle Share&lt;/a&gt; key.
In my brief tests, the Utili-Key seems well made
and I think the tools will do in a pinch when better tools aren&#39;t handy.
I think that when using the bottle opener,
I&#39;ll have to take care not to cut myself on the little blade.
As Jan said, it&#39;ll work for the first bottle,
but it might not be a good idea for the fourth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micro-Max 19-in-1 is amusing, but I doubt I&#39;d carry it often,
since it&#39;s bulkier and heavier.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While the Northeast is being hammered with a major snowstorm,
we&#39;ve enjoyed some unseasonably warm weather in the Northwest.
Yesterday, it was 63°F (17°C) in Seattle—&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/seattle-sets-weather-record-boston-prepares-massiv/njw6m/&#34;&gt;a record high temperature&lt;/a&gt;.

One friend dubbed it “sumter”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/17/YosemiteCleanInstall.aspx&#34;&gt;clean install of OS X 10.10&lt;/a&gt; on my home laptop a week ago.
I tried to launch &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/&#34;&gt;PyCharm&lt;/a&gt; 4.0.4 on it today.
It immediately failed. Every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I looked in the System Console, I saw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;literal-block&#34;&gt;
1/25/15 7:46:00.557 PM pycharm[1160]: No matching VM found.

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JetBrains website wasn&#39;t very helpful when I looked there.
In time, I found a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26438628/crash-jetbrains-ide-with-yosemite-mac-osx-webstorm-intellij&#34;&gt;StackOverflow answer&lt;/a&gt; that put me on the right track
(and reminded me that I had previously solved this problem about a year ago, at work).
PyCharm and some of the other JetBrains IDEs require JDK 1.6,
as there are a number of &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/entries/27854363-IDE-doesn-t-start-after-updating-to-Mac-OS-Yosemite-or-Mavericks&#34;&gt;problems with JDK 1.7 and 1.8&lt;/a&gt;.
After I downloaded and installed &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572&#34;&gt;Apple&#39;s Java 6&lt;/a&gt;, PyCharm ran without further problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, we all use the PyCharm IDE for Python development,
even those of us who are diehard Vim or Emacs users.
It does a great job of helping you write and debug Python projects.
The &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim&#34;&gt;IdeaVim&lt;/a&gt; plugin does an acceptable job of emulating Vim keybindings.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Washington state is well-known for coffee, wineries, and microbreweries.
Dozens of small-batch craft distilleries
have been started in Washington state since 2008
after a change in the law.
Most of them are quite good.
I drink Irish and Scotch whiskies,
but otherwise neither of us drink spirits often,
so we&#39;ve barely tried the local distilleries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drank a really nice gin from Sun Liquor at a New Year&#39;s Eve party,
and we&#39;ve been meaning to follow up.
This afternoon, we stopped at the Oola Distillery on Capitol Hill
and sampled all their wares.
We left with a half bottle of their
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://ooladistillery.com/home#products&#34;&gt;Rosemary Vodka&lt;/a&gt;.
Then we stopped in at Sun Liquor and came out with a bottle of the
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://sunliquor.com/hedgetrimmergin.php&#34;&gt;Hedge Trimmer Gin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the rate we consume spirits, those should last quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I buy a book, I want to be able to read it how and where I like,
not where the bookseller dictates.
With printed books, the very idea of the bookseller having any say is ridiculous.
The book is now my property, to read where and how I like,
to give away or to lend or even to sell.
I&#39;ve bought thousands of new books and thousands more secondhand books from bookstores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most electronic books are crippled with DRM.
DRM stands for &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management&#34;&gt;Digital Rights Management&lt;/a&gt;,
although &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.defectivebydesign.org/&#34;&gt;Defective By Design&lt;/a&gt; prefers to expand DRM
as &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management&#34;&gt;Digital Restrictions Management&lt;/a&gt;.
DRM is technology that controls digital content &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; it has been sold.
In particular, DRM&#39;d ebooks sold at Amazon are encrypted
and can only be read on Kindle devices and apps.
Similarly, DRM&#39;d ebooks from Barnes &amp;amp; Noble are restricted to Nook devices and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some publishers sell DRM-free ebooks at Amazon and B&amp;amp;N,
but they&#39;re in a small minority.
When I buy technical books, I try to buy directly from the publishers,
who will often bundle both the ebook and the pbook editions together
for a fraction of their separate costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having paid for an ebook, I want to read it on whatever computer or device is at hand,
regardless of where I bought it.
I can do that if I remove the DRM encryption.
Tools exist to help with that,
such as Apprentice Alf&#39;s &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/drm-removal-tools-for-ebooks/&#34;&gt;DRM Removal Tools for eBooks&lt;/a&gt;.
The plugin for &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://calibre-ebook.com/&#34;&gt;Calibre&lt;/a&gt; works very well.
I convert ebooks to unlocked EPUBs,
which I can then read on my eInk reader,
or with the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://readium.org/&#34;&gt;Readium&lt;/a&gt; browser extension in Chrome,
or the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/epubreader/&#34;&gt;EPUBReader&lt;/a&gt; browser extension for Firefox,
or the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.canoejoy.com/clearview/&#34;&gt;Clearview&lt;/a&gt; app on my Mac—or in the original seller&#39;s app.
It&#39;s my choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2015/01/15/Audiobooks.html&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, we&#39;ve been listening to some audiobooks.
We finished listening to &lt;em&gt;The Beekeeper&#39;s Apprentice&lt;/em&gt; last night.
I read the book many years ago and I&#39;ve read most of the subsequent books
in the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Russell_%28character%29&#34;&gt;Mary Russell&lt;/a&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen-year-old Mary Russell is walking on the Sussex Downs with her head in a book
one spring day in 1915, when she literally trips over Sherlock Holmes.
Although Holmes is almost four decades her senior,
the two brilliant, lonely people become friends
and Holmes tutors Russell in the art of detection.
Within a few years, his protégé becomes his partner.
In a later book, they marry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King offers a fresh take on Holmes, putting a more human face on him.
Russell and Holmes are both expertly drawn characters,
and King tells a good story.
At times, she revels in the minutiae of daily life,
while at other times, the plot gallops along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audiobook narrator, Jenny Sterlin, also does an excellent job,
finding the right tones for both Russell and Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

to the audiobook of &lt;em&gt;The Hot Rock&lt;/em&gt;, the first of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dortmunder&#34;&gt;Dortmunder&lt;/a&gt; novels.
I just finished reading it as an ebook on my phone.
I enjoyed it a lot but I think I found it funnier when I heard it as an audiobook.
Partly, the first time around, I didn&#39;t know what was coming next;
partly, the narrator&#39;s skillful delivery gave me time to savor the humor.
I read so fast that I gallop past the punchlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dortmunder, newly released from prison, is engaged by an African diplomat
to steal a large emerald that&#39;s held sacred by the nation of Talabwo.
Dortmunder and his gang of misfit crooks steal the jewel,
but the guy with the jewel is caught.
They break him out of jail to get the jewel back, but he hid it in the police station.
They break into the police station and ... it&#39;s not there.
One heist after another, to get their hands on that jinxed jewel.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I sat in a deserted coffee shop this afternoon with Emma,
as much of Seattle was watching the playoff game
of the Seattle Seahawks against the Green Bay Packers.
Idly curious, I checked the score early in the fourth quarter
and found that the Packers were leading 19–7.
I was quite surprised later to find that the Seahawks had won 28–22,
sending themselves to the Super Bowl in Arizona in two weeks&#39; time.
Apparently, it was a thrilling comeback late in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose that I&#39;m happy for my football-loving friends,
though I&#39;m inclined to “love the sinner but hate the sin”,
as I can&#39;t stand football.
I spent eleven years (ages 7–18) at a rugby-playing school in Dublin,
where I came away with an abiding dislike of that game and the jock culture.
American football, if anything, is worse:
a brutal, punishing sport with obnoxious fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re thinking of having a non-Super Bowl Super Bowl party—a football-free party held at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every few years, I find it necessary to wipe my computers
and do a clean install of the operating system.
As a developer and a power user, I install a lot of software.
The cumulative effect of installations and upgrades
is to leave a lot of cruft on the machines.
Entropy increases and the machines grow slower and perhaps less reliable.
So I like to wipe the hard disk, install a new operating system,
and reinstall only those apps that I know I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mid-2012 MacBook Pro came with OS X 10.7.
Shortly thereafer, 10.8 was released and I promptly upgraded; likewise with 10.9.
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Yosemite&#34;&gt;Yosemite&lt;/a&gt; (10.10) was released in October 2014,
but I held off switching until now,
as I knew I wanted to do a clean install,
which meant setting aside a sizeable block of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I backed up everything during the week,
over and above my normal backups of external drives,
&lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.crashplan.com&#34;&gt;CrashPlan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/&#34;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.
I made a list of all the apps that I care about and of various settings.
And I prepared a &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.macworld.com/article/2367748/how-to-make-a-bootable-os-x-10-10-yosemite-install-drive.html&#34;&gt;bootable thumb drive&lt;/a&gt; with the OS X Yosemite Installer app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, I inserted the thumb drive into the USB slot.
I restarted the machine while holding down the Option key,
which brought me to a boot menu.
I used Disk Utility to erase the partition and then I installed Yosemite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I spent many hours installing apps I care about
and restoring data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been a fan of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://brew.sh/&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; package manager for several years.
It does a great job of installing and updating developer-related tools
for use at the command line.
Last year, I learned about a sister project, &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://caskroom.io/&#34;&gt;Homebrew Cask&lt;/a&gt;,
which takes of installing graphical applications.
Instead of downloading DMGs, I used Cask to install a number of apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts&#34;&gt;Caskroom Fonts&lt;/a&gt; last night,
which took care of installing most of the fonts I care about.
One exception: I wanted to install Consolas and some of the other C* fonts
from the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/visuals/32588/the-next-big-thing-in-online-type/&#34;&gt;ClearType Font Collection&lt;/a&gt;, without installing Microsoft Office.
It&#39;s possible to do that via Microsoft&#39;s &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://zjhzxhz.com/2014/01/install-microsofts-consolas-font-on-mac-os-x/&#34;&gt;Open XML File Format Converter for Mac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 2½-year-old machine feels faster and more responsive after the clean install.
I upgraded my late-2013 work MacBook Pro to Yosemite a couple of months ago,
without seeing a difference in performance,
so I attribute the improvement to getting rid of a lot of crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack Whyte&#39;s &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camulod_Chronicles&#34;&gt;Camulod Chronicles&lt;/a&gt; is a series of novels
about King Arthur and Camelot in a post-Roman Britain.
This book tells how Lancelot (Clothar the Frank) came to Camulod and met Arthur—and it takes the entire book to get to that point.
Only after several hundred pages of Clothar&#39;s childhood and early manhood
and fighting a civil war in his uncle&#39;s small kingdom in Gaul,
do we proceed to Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/2007/01/29/ReviewUther.html&#34;&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; and other books in the series,
I found Whyte to be extraordinarily long-winded.
He can tell a story and hold one&#39;s attention,
but he spends too long doing it.
Recommended primarily for completists.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve always been an avid—nay, avaricious—reader of books.
But I have not been a listener of audiobooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read quickly, much more quickly than anyone can speak,
and I enjoy burying my head in a book.
I&#39;ve seen little reason, therefore, to listen to audiobooks.
Lately, however, we&#39;ve listened to some audiobooks on long car trips,
as Emma, unlike me, has an &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.audible.com/&#34;&gt;Audible&lt;/a&gt; subscription.
We enjoyed &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://mobile.audible.com/pd/Mysteries-Thrillers/The-Hot-Rock-Audiobook/B003N9T8SA&#34;&gt;The Hot Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the first of the comic crime-caper &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dortmunder&#34;&gt;Dortmunder&lt;/a&gt; books.
Before that, I had read another Dortmunder novel, &lt;em&gt;Bank Shot&lt;/em&gt;, aloud to Emma,
while she drove us back from Portland,
which both of us had enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our trip to Vancouver earlier this week,
we started listening to &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://mobile.audible.com/pd/Mysteries-Thrillers/The-Beekeepers-Apprentice-or-On-the-Segregation-of-the-Queen-Audiobook/B00HST3AW6&#34;&gt;The Beekeeper&#39;s Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;,
the first of the &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Russell_%28character%29&#34;&gt;Mary Russell&lt;/a&gt; novels about the protégé and wife of Sherlock Holmes.
The recording is 12 hours long, so we&#39;re continuing to listen to it
even though we&#39;re back in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#39;t be giving up reading any time soon,
but I do foresee listening to the occasional audiobook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Rating: $stars(4)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Publisher: Mariner&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;ISBN: &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0544319486/?tag=georgvreill-20&#34;&gt;0544319486&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Pages: 464&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;Reading period: 12–13 January, 2015&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective Inspector Tony McLean of the Edinburgh Police has multiple deaths to deal with:
an elderly rich man, murdered horribly;
the newly discovered corpse of a girl killed in some ghoulish ritual sixty years ago;
and the the death of the grandmother who raised him.
Then more elderly men start being murdered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this police procedural and I liked the character of Tony McLean.
The two cases start dovetailing together (one of my pet peeves)
and I was surprised when the author introduced supernatural elements,
since I had thought it was a straight crime novel.&lt;/p&gt;
